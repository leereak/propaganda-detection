Obama	0	Obama Inaugural Address 20th January 2009    My fellow citizens:  I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.
Obama	0	I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
Obama	0	Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath.
Obama	0	The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.
Obama	0	Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.
Obama	0	At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.
Obama	0	So it has been.
Obama	0	So it must be with this generation of Americans.
Obama	0	That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
Obama	0	Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
Obama	0	Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.
Obama	0	Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.
Obama	0	Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
Obama	0	These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.
Obama	0	Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land - a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights.
Obama	0	Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real.
Obama	0	They are serious and they are many.
Obama	0	They will not be met easily or in a short span of time.
Obama	0	But know this, America - they will be met.
Obama	0	On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.
Obama	0	On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.
Obama	0	We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.
Obama	0	The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.
Obama	0	In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.
Obama	0	It must be earned.
Obama	0	Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less.
Obama	0	It has not been the path for the faint-hearted - for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.
Obama	0	Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.
Obama	0	For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.
Obama	0	For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
Obama	0	For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
Obama	0	Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life.
Obama	0	They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
Obama	0	This is the journey we continue today.
Obama	0	We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth.
Obama	0	Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began.
Obama	0	Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year.
Obama	0	Our capacity remains undiminished.
Obama	0	But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed.
Obama	0	Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.
Obama	0	For everywhere we look, there is work to be done.
Obama	0	The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act - not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.
Obama	0	We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
Obama	0	We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.
Obama	0	We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
Obama	0	And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.
Obama	0	All this we can do.
Obama	0	And all this we will do.
Obama	0	Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions - who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.
Obama	0	Their memories are short.
Obama	0	For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.
Obama	0	What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.
Obama	0	The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works - whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.
Obama	0	Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward.
Obama	0	Where the answer is no, programs will end.
Obama	0	And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account - to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day - because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.
Obama	0	Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control - and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.
Obama	0	The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart - not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.
Obama	0	As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.
Obama	0	Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.
Obama	0	Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake.
Obama	0	And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more.
Obama	0	Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
Obama	0	They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.
Obama	0	Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
Obama	0	We are the keepers of this legacy.
Obama	0	Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort - even greater cooperation and understanding between nations.
Obama	0	We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.
Obama	0	With old friends and former foes, well work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet.
Obama	0	We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.
Obama	0	For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.
Obama	0	We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and non-believers.
Obama	0	We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.
Obama	0	To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
Obama	0	To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West - know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy.
Obama	0	To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.
Obama	0	To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.
Obama	0	And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.
Obama	0	For the world has changed, and we must change with it.
Obama	0	As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
Obama	0	They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.
Obama	0	We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.
Obama	0	And yet, at this moment - a moment that will define a generation - it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
Obama	0	For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies.
Obama	0	It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours.
Obama	0	It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
Obama	0	Our challenges may be new.
Obama	0	The instruments with which we meet them may be new.
Obama	0	But those values upon which our success depends - honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism - these things are old.
Obama	0	These things are true.
Obama	0	They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history.
Obama	0	What is demanded then is a return to these truths.
Obama	0	What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.
Obama	0	This is the price and the promise of citizenship.
Obama	0	This is the source of our confidence - the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.
Obama	0	This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed - why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.
Obama	0	So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled.
Obama	0	In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river.
Obama	0	The capital was abandoned.
Obama	0	The enemy was advancing.
Obama	0	The snow was stained with blood.
Obama	0	At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people: "Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]."
Obama	0	America.
Obama	0	In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words.
Obama	0	With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.
Obama	0	Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
Obama	0	Election Night Victory Speech Grant Park, Illinois November 4, 2008 If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.
Obama	0	It’s the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could be that difference.
Obama	0	It’s the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled – Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United States of America.
Obama	0	It’s the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.
Obama	0	It’s been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.
Obama	0	I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain.
Obama	0	He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he’s fought even longer and harder for the country he loves.
Obama	0	He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
Obama	0	I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation’s promise in the months ahead.
Obama	0	I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.
Obama	0	I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation’s next First Lady, Michelle Obama.
Obama	0	Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that’s coming with us to the White House.
Obama	0	And while she’s no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am.
Obama	0	I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure.
Obama	0	To my campaign manager David Plouffe, my chief strategist David Axelrod, and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics – you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you’ve sacrificed to get it done.
Obama	0	But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to – it belongs to you.
Obama	0	I was never the likeliest candidate for this office.
Obama	0	We didn’t start with much money or many endorsements.
Obama	0	Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington – it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston.
Obama	0	It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause.
Obama	0	It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation’s apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth.
Obama	0	This is your victory.
Obama	0	I know you didn’t do this just to win an election and I know you didn’t do it for me.
Obama	0	You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead.
Obama	0	For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime – two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.
Obama	0	Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us.
Obama	0	There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they’ll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor’s bills, or save enough for college.
Obama	0	There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.
Obama	0	The road ahead will be long.
Obama	0	Our climb will be steep.
Obama	0	We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America – I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there.
Obama	0	I promise you – we as a people will get there.
Obama	0	There will be setbacks and false starts.
Obama	0	There are many who won’t agree with every decision or policy I make as President, and we know that government can’t solve every problem.
Obama	0	But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face.
Obama	0	I will listen to you, especially when we disagree.
Obama	0	And above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it’s been done in America for two-hundred and twenty-one years – block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.
Obama	0	What began twenty-one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night.
Obama	0	This victory alone is not the change we seek – it is only the chance for us to make that change.
Obama	0	And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were.
Obama	0	It cannot happen without you.
Obama	0	So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.
Obama	0	Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it’s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers – in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people.
Obama	0	Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.
Obama	0	Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House – a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.
Obama	0	Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.
Obama	0	As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, “We are not enemies, but friends…though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.” And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn – I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your President too.
Obama	0	And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world – our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.
Obama	0	To those who would tear this world down – we will defeat you.
Obama	0	To those who seek peace and security – we support you.
Obama	0	And to all those who have wondered if America’s beacon still burns as bright – tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.
Obama	0	For that is the true genius of America – that America can change.
Obama	0	Our union can be perfected.
Obama	0	And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.
Obama	0	This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations.
Obama	0	But one that’s on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta.
Obama	0	She’s a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing – Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.
Obama	0	She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn’t vote for two reasons – because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.
Obama	0	And tonight, I think about all that she’s seen throughout her century in America – the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can’t, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.
Obama	0	At a time when women’s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot.
Obama	0	Yes we can.
Obama	0	When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose.
Obama	0	Yes we can.
Obama	0	When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved.
Obama	0	Yes we can.
Obama	0	She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that “We Shall Overcome.” Yes we can.
Obama	0	A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination.
Obama	0	And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
Obama	0	Yes we can.
Obama	0	America, we have come so far.
Obama	0	We have seen so much.
Obama	0	But there is so much more to do.
Obama	0	So tonight, let us ask ourselves – if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?
Obama	0	What progress will we have made?
Obama	0	This is our chance to answer that call.
Obama	0	This is our moment.
Obama	0	This is our time – to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth – that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can.
Obama	0	Thank you, God bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America.
Obama	0	Manassas, Prince William County, Virginia November 3, 2008 10:30pm – Night Before the Election  What a scene.
Obama	0	What a crowd.
Obama	0	Thank you for Virginia.
Obama	0	(Crowd chants "yes we can.")
Obama	0	Let me start by noting, Virginia that this is our last rally.
Obama	0	This is the last rally of a campaign that began nearly 2 years ago.
Obama	0	We've gone to every corner of this country, from here in Northern Virginia to the rocky coasts of Maine, to the open plains of Texas, to the open skies of Montana.
Obama	0	I just want to say that whatever happens tomorrow, I have been deeply humbled by this journey.
Obama	0	You have welcomed Michelle and me and the girls into your homes.
Obama	0	You have shared your stories of struggle, you have spoken of your dreams, along the way, talking with all of you about your own lives.
Obama	0	You have enriched my life, you have moved me again and again.
Obama	0	You have inspired me.
Obama	0	Sometimes when I have been down you have lifted me up.
Obama	0	You filled me with new hope for our future and you have reminded me about what makes America so special.
Obama	0	In the places I have gone and the people I have met, I have been struck again and again by the fundamental decency and generosity and dignity of men and women who work hard without complaint, to meet their responsibilities every day.
Obama	0	I come away with an unyielding belief that if we only had a government as responsible as all of you, as compassionate as the American people, that there is no obstacle that we can't overcome.
Obama	0	There is no destiny that we cannot fulfill.
Obama	0	Virginia, I have just one word for you, just one word.
Obama	0	Tomorrow.
Obama	0	Tomorrow.
Obama	0	After decades of broken politics in Washington, 8 years of failed policies from George Bush, twenty-one months of campaigning, we are less then one day away from bringing about change in America.
Obama	0	Tomorrow you can turn the page on policies that put greed and irresponsibility before hard work and sacrifice.
Obama	0	Tomorrow you can choose policies that invest in our middle class, create new jobs and grow this economy so that everybody has a chance to succeed.
Obama	0	Not just the CEO but the secretary and the janitor; not just the factory owner but the men and women who work the factory floor.
Obama	0	Tomorrow you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election; that puts reason against reason, and city against town, Republican against Democrat; that asks us to fear at a time when we need to hope.
Obama	0	Tomorrow, at this defining moment in history, you can give this country the change that we need.
Obama	0	It starts here in Virginia.
Obama	0	It starts here in Manassas.
Obama	0	This is where change begins.
Obama	0	Our campaign has not been perfect.
Obama	0	There are times when I look back and I've said, "you know I wouldn't have done that if I had thought about it a little bit more."
Obama	0	But I'll tell you what.
Obama	0	When you think about this campaign we've got a lot to be proud of when it comes to the tone that we have set.
Obama	0	We tried to argue issues and not engage in personal attacks.
Obama	0	We've been fierce in defending ourselves but we've tried to make sure that we are always reminding our supporters that all of us are in this together.
Obama	0	Black, white, Hispanic, native American, Asian, Democrats and Republicans, young and old, rich and poor, gay and straight, disabled and not disabled, all of us have something to contribute.
Obama	0	We tried to communicate for these last two years that we can't afford the same political games, the same tactics that pit us against one another, that make us afraid of each other.
Obama	0	We can't afford that anymore.
Obama	0	Not this time.
Obama	0	Despite what our opponents might claim, there are no real or fake parts of Virginia anymore and then there are real or fake parts of America.
Obama	0	There is no city or town that is more pro-America than anywhere else.
Obama	0	We are all one nation.
Obama	0	All of us proud.
Obama	0	All of us patriots.
Obama	0	All of us salute this flag.
Obama	0	The men and women who serve on our battlefields come from many walks of life, different political parties, but they fought together and they bled together.
Obama	0	Some die together under the same proud flag.
Obama	0	They have not served red America or blue America, they have served the United States of America.
Obama	0	And that is what this campaign has been about, we're calling us to serve the United States of America.
Obama	0	In this campaign I have had the privilege to witness what is best in America, in the stories, in the faces, of men and women I have met at countless rallies, town hall meetings, VFW halls, living rooms, diners, all across America, men and women who shared with me their stories and spoke of their struggles but they also spoke of their hopes and dreams.
Obama	0	They want for their children a sense of obligation and debts to be paid to earlier generations.
Obama	0	I met one of those women in Greenwood, South Carolina.
Obama	0	It was back early when we were way back in the polls.
Obama	0	Nobody gave us much of a chance back then.
Obama	0	I had gone to South Carolina early in the campaign to see what I could stir up in the way of endorsements, and I was at a legislative dinner sitting next to a state representative that I really wanted to endorse me.
Obama	0	So I turned to her and I said "I really want your endorsement."
Obama	0	And she looked at me and she said "I'll tell you what, Obama, I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina."
Obama	0	I must have had a sip of wine or something that night because right away I said "Okay.
Obama	0	I'm coming."
Obama	0	So the next time I come to South Carolina it's about a month later.
Obama	0	We fly in about midnight.
Obama	0	We get to the hotel about one o'clock in the morning.
Obama	0	I'm exhausted.
Obama	0	I'm dragging my bags to my room when I get a tap on my shoulder and I look back and it is one of my staff people who says "Senator we need to be out of the hotel by 6 a.m." I say "Why is that?"
Obama	0	He says "because we have to go to Greenwood, like you promised."
Obama	0	So the next morning I wake up and I feel terrible, and I think I am coming down with a cold, my back is sore, I feel worse than when I went to bed.
Obama	0	I open up the curtains in the hotel room to get some sunlight in and hopefully wake me up, but it's pouring down rain.
Obama	0	I go outside my room and get the New York Times, and there is a bad story about me in the New York Times.
Obama	0	I go downstairs after I pack, and my umbrella blows open and I get soaked, so by the time I get in the car I am mad, I am wet and I am sleepy.
Obama	0	We drive, and we drive, and we drive.
Obama	0	It turns out that Greenwood is about an hour and a half from everywhere else.
Obama	0	Finally we get to Greenwood.
Obama	0	First of all you do not know you're in Greenwood when you get to Greenwood, there aren't a lot of tall buildings in Greenwood.
Obama	0	We pull off to a small building — a little field house in a park — and we go inside, and low and behold, after an hour and a half drive, turns out there are 20 people there.
Obama	0	Twenty people.
Obama	0	They look all kind of damp and sleepy, maybe they aren't really excited to be there either.
Obama	0	But I am a professional, I've got to do what I got to do.
Obama	0	I'm going around, I'm shaking hands, I am saying "How are you doing?
Obama	0	What are you doing?"
Obama	0	As I go around the room suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me "fired up."
Obama	0	I'm shocked.
Obama	0	I jumped up.
Obama	0	I don't know what is going on.
Obama	0	But everyone else acts as though this were normal and they say "fired up."
Obama	0	Then I hear this voice say "ready to go."
Obama	0	And the 20 people in the room act like this happens all the time and they say "ready to go".
Obama	0	I don't know what's going on so I looked behind me and there is this small woman, about 60 years old, a little over 5 feet, looks like she just came from church — she's got on a big church hat.
Obama	0	She's standing there, she looks at me and she smiles and she says "fired up."
Obama	0	It turns out that she was a city Councilwoman from Greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective.
Obama	0	I'm not making this up.
Obama	0	And it turns out that she is famous for her chant.
Obama	0	She does this where ever she goes.
Obama	0	She says "fired up" and the people say "fired up", and she says "ready to go" and they say "ready to go."
Obama	0	For the next five minutes she proceeds to do this.
Obama	0	"Fired up?"
Obama	0	and everyone says "fired up" and she says "ready to go" and they say "ready to go."
Obama	0	I'm standing there and I'm thinking I'm being outflanked by this woman.
Obama	0	She's stealing my thunder.
Obama	0	I look at my staff and they shrugged their shoulders, they don't know how long this is going to go on.
Obama	0	But here's the thing, Virginia.
Obama	0	After a minute or so I am feeling kind of fired up.
Obama	0	I'm feeling like I'm ready to go.
Obama	0	So I join in the chant.
Obama	0	It feels good.
Obama	0	For the rest of the day, even after we left Greenwood, even though it was still raining, even though I was still not getting big crowds anywhere, even though we hadn't gotten the endorsement from the people we were hoping for, somehow I felt a little lighter, a little better.
Obama	0	I'd see my staff and I would say "Are you fired up?
Obama	0	and they would say "We are fired up, boss, are you ready to go?"
Obama	0	And I'd say "I'm ready to go."
Obama	0	Here's my point, Virginia.
Obama	0	That's how this thing started.
Obama	0	It shows you what one voice can do.
Obama	0	That one voice can change a room.
Obama	0	And if a voice can change a room, it can change a city, and if it can change a city, it can change a state, and if it can change a state, it can change a nation, and if it can change a nation, it can change the world.
Obama	0	Virginia, your voice can change the world tomorrow.
Obama	0	In 21 hours if you are willing to endure some rain, if you are willing to drag that person you know who is not going to vote, to the polls.
Obama	0	If you are willing to organize and volunteer in the offices, if you are willing to stand with me, if you are willing to fight with me, I know your voice will matter.
Obama	0	So I have just one question for you Virginia, Are you fired up?
Obama	0	Ready to go?
Obama	0	Fired up.
Obama	0	Ready to go.
Obama	0	Fired up.
Obama	0	Ready to go.
Obama	0	Fired up.
Obama	0	Ready to go.
Obama	0	Virginia, let's go change the world.
Obama	0	God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
Obama	0	The American Promise Acceptance Speech at the Democratic Convention Mile High Stadium, Denver Colorado August 28, 2008 To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation; With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
Obama	0	Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Obama	0	To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.
Obama	0	I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.
Obama	0	To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.
Obama	0	Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
Obama	0	It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
Obama	0	That's why I stand here tonight.
Obama	0	Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.
Obama	0	We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.
Obama	0	Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less.
Obama	0	More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.
Obama	0	More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.
Obama	0	These challenges are not all of government's making.
Obama	0	But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.
Obama	0	America, we are better than these last eight years.
Obama	0	We are a better country than this.
Obama	0	This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.
Obama	0	This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
Obama	0	We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.
Obama	0	Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!
Obama	0	This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.
Obama	0	Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third.
Obama	0	And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.
Obama	0	On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Obama	0	Now let there be no doubt.
Obama	0	The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
Obama	0	And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.
Obama	0	But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time.
Obama	0	Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
Obama	0	I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.
Obama	0	The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
Obama	0	He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President.
Obama	0	He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.
Obama	0	And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
Obama	0	A nation of whiners?
Obama	0	Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.
Obama	0	Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty.
Obama	0	These are not whiners.
Obama	0	They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint.
Obama	0	These are the Americans that I know.
Obama	0	Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans.
Obama	0	I just think he doesn't know.
Obama	0	Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year?
Obama	0	How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?
Obama	0	How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?
Obama	0	It's not because John McCain doesn't care.
Obama	0	It's because John McCain doesn't get it.
Obama	0	For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
Obama	0	In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own.
Obama	0	Out of work?
Obama	0	Tough luck.
Obama	0	No health care?
Obama	0	The market will fix it.
Obama	0	Born into poverty?
Obama	0	Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots.
Obama	0	You're on your own.
Obama	0	Well it's time for them to own their failure.
Obama	0	It's time for us to change America.
Obama	0	You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.
Obama	0	We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
Obama	0	We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.
Obama	0	We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.
Obama	0	The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
Obama	0	Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.
Obama	0	In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
Obama	0	When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
Obama	0	And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
Obama	0	She's the one who taught me about hard work.
Obama	0	She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life.
Obama	0	She poured everything she had into me.
Obama	0	And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.
Obama	0	I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.
Obama	0	These are my heroes.
Obama	0	Theirs are the stories that shaped me.
Obama	0	And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.
Obama	0	What is that promise?
Obama	0	It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.
Obama	0	It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
Obama	0	Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
Obama	0	Our government should work for us, not against us.
Obama	0	It should help us, not hurt us.
Obama	0	It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.
Obama	0	That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.
Obama	0	That's the promise we need to keep.
Obama	0	That's the change we need right now.
Obama	0	So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.
Obama	0	Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.
Obama	0	Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
Obama	0	I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.
Obama	0	I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families.
Obama	0	Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.
Obama	0	And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
Obama	0	Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.
Obama	0	In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
Obama	0	And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.
Obama	0	Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
Obama	0	Not even close.
Obama	0	As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.
Obama	0	I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.
Obama	0	I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.
Obama	0	And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
Obama	0	America, now is not the time for small plans.
Obama	0	Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
Obama	0	Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.
Obama	0	And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.
Obama	0	I'll invest in early childhood education.
Obama	0	I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support.
Obama	0	And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.
Obama	0	And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
Obama	0	Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.
Obama	0	If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
Obama	0	If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
Obama	0	And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
Obama	0	Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
Obama	0	Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.
Obama	0	And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
Obama	0	Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
Obama	0	But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
Obama	0	And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money.
Obama	0	It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength."
Obama	0	Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
Obama	0	Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
Obama	0	But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
Obama	0	Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.
Obama	0	And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad.
Obama	0	If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.
Obama	0	For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
Obama	0	When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
Obama	0	John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.
Obama	0	And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
Obama	0	That's not the judgment we need.
Obama	0	That won't keep America safe.
Obama	0	We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.
Obama	0	You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.
Obama	0	You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington.
Obama	0	You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
Obama	0	If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.
Obama	0	We are the party of Roosevelt.
Obama	0	We are the party of Kennedy.
Obama	0	So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country.
Obama	0	Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe.
Obama	0	The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
Obama	0	As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
Obama	0	I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Obama	0	I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts.
Obama	0	But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
Obama	0	I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
Obama	0	And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
Obama	0	These are the policies I will pursue.
Obama	0	And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.
Obama	0	But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
Obama	0	Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
Obama	0	The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
Obama	0	So let us agree that patriotism has no party.
Obama	0	I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain.
Obama	0	The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.
Obama	0	They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.
Obama	0	So I've got news for you, John McCain.
Obama	0	We all put our country first.
Obama	0	America, our work will not be easy.
Obama	0	The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
Obama	0	For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.
Obama	0	What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose.
Obama	0	And that's what we have to restore.
Obama	0	We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
Obama	0	The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
Obama	0	I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
Obama	0	Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
Obama	0	This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
Obama	0	I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
Obama	0	They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
Obama	0	And that's to be expected.
Obama	0	Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
Obama	0	If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.
Obama	0	You make a big election about small things.
Obama	0	And you know what - it's worked before.
Obama	0	Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.
Obama	0	When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty.
Obama	0	If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.
Obama	0	I get it.
Obama	0	I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.
Obama	0	I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.
Obama	0	But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring.
Obama	0	What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me.
Obama	0	It's been about you.
Obama	0	For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
Obama	0	You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result.
Obama	0	You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.
Obama	0	Change comes to Washington.
Obama	0	Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
Obama	0	America, this is one of those moments.
Obama	0	I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.
Obama	0	Because I've seen it.
Obama	0	Because I've lived it.
Obama	0	I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
Obama	0	I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
Obama	0	And I've seen it in this campaign.
Obama	0	In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.
Obama	0	In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
Obama	0	I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
Obama	0	This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
Obama	0	We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
Obama	0	Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.
Obama	0	Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
Obama	0	That promise is our greatest inheritance.
Obama	0	It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
Obama	0	And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
Obama	0	The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
Obama	0	They could've heard words of anger and discord.
Obama	0	They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
Obama	0	But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
Obama	0	That together, our dreams can be one.
Obama	0	"We cannot walk alone," the preacher cried.
Obama	0	"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
Obama	0	We cannot turn back."
Obama	0	America, we cannot turn back.
Obama	0	Not with so much work to be done.
Obama	0	Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.
Obama	0	Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
Obama	0	Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.
Obama	0	America, we cannot turn back.
Obama	0	We cannot walk alone.
Obama	0	At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.
Obama	0	Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
Obama	0	Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America.
Obama	0	Final Primary Night Presumptive Democratic Nominee Speech St. Paul, Minnesota June 3, 2008 Tonight, after fifty-four hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end.
Obama	0	Sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois.
Obama	0	Thousands of miles have been traveled.
Obama	0	Millions of voices have been heard.
Obama	0	And because of what you said – because you decided that change must come to Washington; because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest; because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another – a journey that will bring a new and better day to America.
Obama	0	Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.
Obama	0	I want to thank every American who stood with us over the course of this campaign – through the good days and the bad; from the snows of Cedar Rapids to the sunshine of Sioux Falls.
Obama	0	And tonight I also want to thank the men and woman who took this journey with me as fellow candidates for President.
Obama	0	At this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for this office.
Obama	0	I have not just competed with them as rivals, I have learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better.
Obama	0	They are leaders of this party, and leaders that America will turn to for years to come.
Obama	0	That is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else.
Obama	0	Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she's a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight.
Obama	0	We've certainly had our differences over the last sixteen months.
Obama	0	But as someone who's shared a stage with her many times, I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning – even in the face of tough odds – is exactly what sent her and Bill Clinton to sign up for their first campaign in Texas all those years ago; what sent her to work at the Children's Defense Fund and made her fight for health care as First Lady; what led her to the United States Senate and fueled her barrier-breaking campaign for the presidency – an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be.
Obama	0	And you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country, she will be central to that victory.
Obama	0	When we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen.
Obama	0	Our party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Obama	0	There are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided.
Obama	0	Well I say that because of this primary, there are millions of Americans who have cast their ballot for the very first time.
Obama	0	There are Independents and Republicans who understand that this election isn't just about the party in charge of Washington, it's about the need to change Washington.
Obama	0	There are young people, and African-Americans, and Latinos, and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation.
Obama	0	All of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply.
Obama	0	But at the end of the day, we aren't the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard.
Obama	0	You didn't do that because of me or Senator Clinton or anyone else.
Obama	0	You did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment – a moment that will define a generation – we cannot afford to keep doing what we've been doing.
Obama	0	We owe our children a better future.
Obama	0	We owe our country a better future.
Obama	0	And for all those who dream of that future tonight, I say – let us begin the work together.
Obama	0	Let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for America.
Obama	0	In just a few short months, the Republican Party will arrive in St. Paul with a very different agenda.
Obama	0	They will come here to nominate John McCain, a man who has served this country heroically.
Obama	0	I honor that service, and I respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny mine.
Obama	0	My differences with him are not personal; they are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign.
Obama	0	Because while John McCain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past, such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign.
Obama	0	It's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush ninety-five percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year.
Obama	0	It's not change when he offers four more years of Bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying jobs, or insure our workers, or help Americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college – policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average American family, widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street, and left our children with a mountain of debt.
Obama	0	And it's not change when he promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians – a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in Iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isn't making the American people any safer.
Obama	0	So I'll say this – there are many words to describe John McCain's attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush's policies as bipartisan and new.
Obama	0	But change is not one of them.
Obama	0	Change is a foreign policy that doesn't begin and end with a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged.
Obama	0	I won't stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in Iraq, but what's not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years – especially at a time when our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other threat to America is being ignored.
Obama	0	We must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in - but start leaving we must.
Obama	0	It's time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their future.
Obama	0	It's time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care they need and the benefits they deserve when they come home.
Obama	0	It's time to refocus our efforts on al Qaeda's leadership and Afghanistan, and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century – terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease.
Obama	0	That's what change is.
Obama	0	Change is realizing that meeting today's threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our diplomacy – tough, direct diplomacy where the President of the United States isn't afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we stand for.
Obama	0	We must once again have the courage and conviction to lead the free world.
Obama	0	That is the legacy of Roosevelt, and Truman, and Kennedy.
Obama	0	That's what the American people want.
Obama	0	That's what change is.
Obama	0	Change is building an economy that rewards not just wealth, but the work and workers who created it.
Obama	0	It's understanding that the struggles facing working families can't be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs, but by giving a the middle-class a tax break, and investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation.
Obama	0	It's understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when Bill Clinton was President.
Obama	0	John McCain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy – cities in Michigan, and Ohio, and right here in Minnesota – he'd understand the kind of change that people are looking for.
Obama	0	Maybe if he went to Iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who's ill, he'd understand that she can't afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and wealthy.
Obama	0	She needs us to pass health care plan that guarantees insurance to every American who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it.
Obama	0	That's the change we need.
Obama	0	Maybe if he went to Pennsylvania and met the man who lost his job but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one, he'd understand that we can't afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators.
Obama	0	That man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future – an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced.
Obama	0	That's the change we need.
Obama	0	And maybe if he spent some time in the schools of South Carolina or St. Paul or where he spoke tonight in New Orleans, he'd understand that we can't afford to leave the money behind for No Child Left Behind; that we owe it to our children to invest in early childhood education; to recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support; to finally decide that in this global economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the wealthy few, but the birthright of every American.
Obama	0	That's the change we need in America.
Obama	0	That's why I'm running for President.
Obama	0	The other side will come here in September and offer a very different set of policies and positions, and that is a debate I look forward to.
Obama	0	It is a debate the American people deserve.
Obama	0	But what you don't deserve is another election that's governed by fear, and innuendo, and division.
Obama	0	What you won't hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge, and patriotism as a bludgeon – that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge, but enemies to demonize.
Obama	0	Because we may call ourselves Democrats and Republicans, but we are Americans first.
Obama	0	We are always Americans first.
Obama	0	Despite what the good Senator from Arizona said tonight, I have seen people of differing views and opinions find common cause many times during my two decades in public life, and I have brought many together myself.
Obama	0	I've walked arm-in-arm with community leaders on the South Side of Chicago and watched tensions fade as black, white, and Latino fought together for good jobs and good schools.
Obama	0	I've sat across the table from law enforcement and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice system that sent thirteen innocent people to death row.
Obama	0	And I've worked with friends in the other party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with a tax break; to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the American people know where their tax dollars are being spent; and to reduce the influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in Washington.
Obama	0	In our country, I have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything, but because behind all the labels and false divisions and categories that define us; beyond all the petty bickering and point-scoring in Washington, Americans are a decent, generous, compassionate people, united by common challenges and common hopes.
Obama	0	And every so often, there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again.
Obama	0	So it was for that band of patriots who declared in a Philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union; and for all those who gave on the fields of Gettysburg and Antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union.
Obama	0	So it was for the Greatest Generation that conquered fear itself, and liberated a continent from tyranny, and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity.
Obama	0	So it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines; the women who shattered glass ceilings; the children who braved a Selma bridge for freedom's cause.
Obama	0	So it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world that's better, and kinder, and more just.
Obama	0	And so it must be for us.
Obama	0	America, this is our moment.
Obama	0	This is our time.
Obama	0	Our time to turn the page on the policies of the past.
Obama	0	Our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face.
Obama	0	Our time to offer a new direction for the country we love.
Obama	0	The journey will be difficult.
Obama	0	The road will be long.
Obama	0	I face this challenge with profound humility, and knowledge of my own limitations.
Obama	0	But I also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the American people.
Obama	0	Because if we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth.
Obama	0	This was the moment – this was the time – when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves, and our highest ideals.
Obama	0	Thank you, God Bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America.
Obama	0	North Carolina Primary Night Raleigh, NC May 6, 2008 You know, some were saying that North Carolina would be a game-changer in this election.
Obama	0	But today, what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington, DC.
Obama	0	I want to start by congratulating Senator Clinton on her victory in the state of Indiana.
Obama	0	And I want to thank the people of North Carolina for giving us a victory in a big state, a swing state, and a state where we will compete to win if I am the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.
Obama	0	When this campaign began, Washington didn't give us much of a chance.
Obama	0	But because you came out in the bitter cold, and knocked on doors, and enlisted your friends and neighbors in this cause; because you stood up to the cynics, and the doubters, and the nay-sayers when we were up and when we were down; because you still believe that this is our moment, and our time, for change – tonight we stand less than two hundred delegates away from securing the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.
Obama	0	More importantly, because of you, we have seen that it's possible to overcome the politics of division and distraction; that it's possible to overcome the same old negative attacks that are always about scoring points and never about solving our problems.
Obama	0	We've seen that the American people aren't looking for more spin or more gimmicks, but honest answers about the challenges we face.
Obama	0	That's what you've accomplished in this campaign, and that's how we'll change this country together.
Obama	0	This has been one of the longest, most closely fought contests in history.
Obama	0	And that's partly because we have such a formidable opponent in Senator Hillary Clinton.
Obama	0	Tonight, many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided – that Senator Clinton's supporters will not support me, and that my supporters will not support her.
Obama	0	Well I'm here tonight to tell you that I don't believe it.
Obama	0	Yes, there have been bruised feelings on both sides.
Obama	0	Yes, each side desperately wants their candidate to win.
Obama	0	But ultimately, this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain.
Obama	0	This election is about you – the American people – and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future.
Obama	0	This primary season may not be over, but when it is, we will have to remember who we are as Democrats – that we are the party of Jefferson and Jackson; of Roosevelt and Kennedy; and that we are at our best when we lead with principle; when we lead with conviction; when we summon an entire nation around a common purpose – a higher purpose.
Obama	0	This fall, we intend to march forward as one Democratic Party, united by a common vision for this country.
Obama	0	Because we all agree that at this defining moment in history – a moment when we're facing two wars, an economy in turmoil, a planet in peril – we can't afford to give John McCain the chance to serve out George Bush's third term.
Obama	0	We need change in America.
Obama	0	The woman I met in Indiana who just lost her job, and her pension, and her insurance when the plant where she worked at her entire life closed down – she can't afford four more years of tax breaks for corporations like the one that shipped her job overseas.
Obama	0	She needs us to give tax breaks to companies that create good jobs here in America.
Obama	0	She can't afford four more years of tax breaks for CEOs like the one who walked away from her company with a multi-million dollar bonus.
Obama	0	She needs middle-class tax relief that will help her pay the skyrocketing price of groceries, and gas, and college tuition.
Obama	0	That's why I'm running for President.
Obama	0	The college student I met in Iowa who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who's ill – she can't afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy; that allows insurance companies to discriminate and deny coverage to those Americans who need it most.
Obama	0	She needs us to stand up to those insurance companies and pass a plan that lowers every family's premiums and gives every uninsured American the same kind of coverage that Members of Congress give themselves.
Obama	0	That's why I'm running for President.
Obama	0	The mother in Wisconsin who gave me a bracelet inscribed with the name of the son she lost in Iraq; the families who pray for their loved ones to come home; the heroes on their third and fourth and fifth tour of duty – they can't afford four more years of a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged.
Obama	0	They can't afford four more years of our veterans returning to broken-down barracks and substandard care.
Obama	0	They need us to end a war that isn't making us safer.
Obama	0	They need us to treat them with the care and respect they deserve.
Obama	0	That's why I'm running for President.
Obama	0	The man I met in Pennsylvania who lost his job but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one – he can't afford four more years of an energy policy written by the oil companies and for the oil companies; a policy that's not only keeping gas at record prices, but funding both sides of the war on terror and destroying our planet in the process.
Obama	0	He doesn't need four more years of Washington policies that sound good, but don't solve the problem.
Obama	0	He needs us to take a permanent holiday from our oil addiction by making the automakers raise their fuel standards, corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future.
Obama	0	That's the change we need.
Obama	0	And that's why I'm running for President.
Obama	0	The people I've met in small towns and big cities across this country understand that government can't solve all our problems – and we don't expect it to.
Obama	0	We believe in hard work.
Obama	0	We believe in personal responsibility and self-reliance.
Obama	0	But we also believe that we have a larger responsibility to one another as Americans – that America is a place – that America is the place – where you can make it if you try.
Obama	0	That no matter how much money you start with or where you come from or who your parents are, opportunity is yours if you're willing to reach for it and work for it.
Obama	0	It's the idea that while there are few guarantees in life, you should be able to count on a job that pays the bills; health care for when you need it; a pension for when you retire; an education for your children that will allow them to fulfill their God-given potential.
Obama	0	That's the America we believe in.
Obama	0	That's the America I know.
Obama	0	This is the country that gave my grandfather a chance to go to college on the GI Bill when he came home from World War II; a country that gave him and my grandmother the chance to buy their first home with a loan from the government.
Obama	0	This is the country that made it possible for my mother – a single parent who had to go on food stamps at one point – to send my sister and me to the best schools in the country on scholarships.
Obama	0	This is the country that allowed my father-in-law – a city worker at a South Side water filtration plant – to provide for his wife and two children on a single salary.
Obama	0	This is a man who was diagnosed at age thirty with multiple sclerosis – who relied on a walker to get himself to work.
Obama	0	And yet, every day he went, and he labored, and he sent my wife and her brother to one of the best colleges in the nation.
Obama	0	It was a job that didn't just give him a paycheck, but a sense of dignity and self-worth.
Obama	0	It was an America that didn't just reward wealth, but the work and the workers who created it.
Obama	0	Somewhere along the way, between all the bickering and the influence-peddling and the game-playing of the last few decades, Washington and Wall Street have lost touch with these values.
Obama	0	And while I honor John McCain's service to his country, his ideas for America are out of touch with these values.
Obama	0	His plans for the future are nothing more than the failed policies of the past.
Obama	0	And his plan to win in November appears to come from the very same playbook that his side has used time after time in election after election.
Obama	0	Yes, we know what's coming.
Obama	0	We've seen it already.
Obama	0	The same names and labels they always pin on everyone who doesn't agree with all their ideas.
Obama	0	The same efforts to distract us from the issues that affect our lives by pouncing on every gaffe and association and fake controversy in the hope that the media will play along.
Obama	0	The attempts to play on our fears and exploit our differences to turn us against each other for pure political gain – to slice and dice this country into Red States and Blue States; blue-collar and white-collar; white and black, and brown.
Obama	0	This is what they will do – no matter which one of us is the nominee.
Obama	0	The question, then, is not what kind of campaign they'll run, it's what kind of campaign we will run.
Obama	0	It's what we will do to make this year different.
Obama	0	I didn't get into race thinking that I could avoid this kind of politics, but I am running for President because this is the time to end it.
Obama	0	We will end it this time not because I'm perfect – I think by now this campaign has reminded all of us of that.
Obama	0	We will end it not by duplicating the same tactics and the same strategies as the other side, because that will just lead us down the same path of polarization and gridlock.
Obama	0	We will end it by telling the truth – forcefully, repeatedly, confidently – and by trusting that the American people will embrace the need for change.
Obama	0	Because that's how we've always changed this country – not from the top-down, but from the bottom-up; when you – the American people – decide that the stakes are too high and the challenges are too great.
Obama	0	The other side can label and name-call all they want, but I trust the American people to recognize that it's not surrender to end the war in Iraq so that we can rebuild our military and go after al Qaeda's leaders.
Obama	0	I trust the American people to understand that it's not weakness, but wisdom to talk not just to our friends, but our enemies – like Roosevelt did, and Kennedy did, and Truman did.
Obama	0	I trust the American people to realize that while we don't need big government, we do need a government that stands up for families who are being tricked out of their homes by Wall Street predators; a government that stands up for the middle-class by giving them a tax break; a government that ensures that no American will ever lose their life savings just because their child gets sick.
Obama	0	Security and opportunity; compassion and prosperity aren't liberal values or conservative values – they're American values.
Obama	0	Most of all, I trust the American people's desire to no longer be defined by our differences.
Obama	0	Because no matter where I've been in this country – whether it was the corn fields of Iowa or the textile mills of the Carolinas; the streets of San Antonio or the foothills of Georgia – I've found that while we may have different stories, we hold common hopes.
Obama	0	We may not look the same or come from the same place, but we want to move in the same direction – towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren.
Obama	0	That's why I'm in this race.
Obama	0	I love this country too much to see it divided and distracted at this moment in history.
Obama	0	I believe in our ability to perfect this union because it's the only reason I'm standing here today.
Obama	0	And I know the promise of America because I have lived it.
Obama	0	It is the light of opportunity that led my father across an ocean.
Obama	0	It is the founding ideals that the flag draped over my grandfather's coffin stands for – it is life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Obama	0	It's the simple truth I learned all those years ago when I worked in the shadows of a shuttered steel mill on the South Side of Chicago – that in this country, justice can be won against the greatest of odds; hope can find its way back to the darkest of corners; and when we are told that we cannot bring about the change that we seek, we answer with one voice – yes we can.
Obama	0	So don't ever forget that this election is not about me, or any candidate.
Obama	0	Don't ever forget that this campaign is about you – about your hopes, about your dreams, about your struggles, about securing your portion of the American Dream.
Obama	0	Don't ever forget that we have a choice in this country – that we can choose not to be divided; that we can choose not to be afraid; that we can still choose this moment to finally come together and solve the problems we've talked about all those other years in all those other elections.
Obama	0	This time can be different than all the rest.
Obama	0	This time we can face down those who say our road is too long; that our climb is too steep; that we can no longer achieve the change that we seek.
Obama	0	This is our time to answer the call that so many generations of Americans have answered before – by insisting that by hard work, and by sacrifice, the American Dream will endure.
Obama	0	Thank you, and may God Bless the United States of America.
Obama	0	Pennsylvania Primary Night Evansville, Indiana April 22, 2008 I want to start by congratulating Senator Clinton on her victory tonight, and I want to thank the hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians who stood with our campaign today.
Obama	0	There were a lot of folks who didn't think we could make this a close race when it started.
Obama	0	But we worked hard, and we traveled across the state to big cities and small towns, to factory floors and VFW halls.
Obama	0	And now, six weeks later, we closed the gap.
Obama	0	We rallied people of every age and race and background to our cause.
Obama	0	And whether they were inspired for the first time or for the first time in a long time, we registered a record number of voters who will lead our party to victory in November.
Obama	0	These Americans cast their ballot for the same reason you came here tonight; for the same reason that millions of Americans have gone door-to-door and given whatever small amount they can to this campaign; for the same reason that we began this journey just a few hundred miles from here on a cold February morning in Springfield - because we believe that the challenges we face are bigger than the smallness of our politics, and we know that this election is our chance to change it.
Obama	0	After fourteen long months, it's easy to forget this from time to time - to lose sight of the fierce urgency of this moment.
Obama	0	It's easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the tit-for-tat that consumes our politics; the bickering that none of us are immune to, and that trivializes the profound issues - two wars, an economy in recession, a planet in peril.
Obama	0	But that kind of politics is not why we're here.
Obama	0	It's not why I'm here and it's not why you're here.
Obama	0	We're here because of the more than one hundred workers in Logansport, Indiana who just found out that their company has decided to move its entire factory to Taiwan.
Obama	0	We're here because of the young man I met in Youngsville, North Carolina who almost lost his home because he has three children with cystic fibrosis and couldn't pay their medical bills; who still doesn't have health insurance for himself or his wife and lives in fear that a single illness could cost them everything.
Obama	0	We're here because there are families all across this country who are sitting around the kitchen table right now trying to figure out how to pay their insurance premiums, and their kids' tuition, and still make the mortgage so they're not the next ones in the neighborhood to put a For Sale sign in the front yard; who will lay awake tonight wondering if next week's paycheck will cover next month's bills.
Obama	0	We're not here to talk about change for change's sake, but because our families, our communities, and our country desperately need it.
Obama	0	We're here because we can't afford to keep doing what we've been doing for another four years.
Obama	0	We can't afford to play the same Washington games with the same Washington players and expect a different result.
Obama	0	Not this time.
Obama	0	Not now.
Obama	0	We already know what we're getting from the other party's nominee.
Obama	0	John McCain has offered this country a lifetime of service, and we respect that, but what he's not offering is any meaningful change from the policies of George W. Bush.
Obama	0	John McCain believes that George Bush's Iraq policy is a success, so he's offering four more years of a war with no exit strategy; a war that's sending our troops on their third tour, and fourth tour, and fifth tour of duty; a war that's costing us billions of dollars a month and hasn't made us any safer.
Obama	0	John McCain said that George Bush's economic policies have led to "great progress" over the last seven years, and so he's promising four more years of tax cuts for CEOs and corporations who didn't need them and weren't asking for them; tax cuts that he once voted against because he said they "offended his conscience."
Obama	0	Well they may have stopped offending John McCain's conscience somewhere along the road to the White House, but George Bush's economic policies still offend ours.
Obama	0	Because I don't think that the 232,000 Americans who've lost their jobs this year are seeing the great progress that John McCain has seen.
Obama	0	I don't think the millions of Americans losing their homes have seen that progress.
Obama	0	I don't think the families without health care and the workers without pensions have seen that progress.
Obama	0	And if we continue down the same reckless path, I don't think that future generations who'll be saddled with debt will see these as years of progress.
Obama	0	We already know that John McCain offers more of the same.
Obama	0	The question is not whether the other party will bring about change in Washington - the question is, will we?
Obama	0	Because the truth is, the challenges we face are not just the fault of one man or one party.
Obama	0	How many years - how many decades - have we been talking about solving our health care crisis?
Obama	0	How many Presidents have promised to end our dependence on foreign oil?
Obama	0	How many jobs have gone overseas in the 70s, and the 80s, and the 90s?
Obama	0	And we still haven't done anything about it.
Obama	0	And we know why.
Obama	0	In every election, politicians come to your cities and your towns, and they tell you what you want to hear, and they make big promises, and they lay out all these plans and policies.
Obama	0	But then they go back to Washington when the campaign's over.
Obama	0	Lobbyists spend millions of dollars to get their way.
Obama	0	The status quo sets in.
Obama	0	And instead of fighting for health care or jobs, Washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week.
Obama	0	It happens year after year after year.
Obama	0	Well this is your chance to say "Not this year."
Obama	0	This is your chance to say "Not this time."
Obama	0	We have a choice in this election.
Obama	0	We can be a party that says there's no problem with taking money from Washington lobbyists - from oil lobbyists and drug lobbyists and insurance lobbyists.
Obama	0	We can pretend that they represent real Americans and look the other way when they use their money and influence to stop us from reforming health care or investing in renewable energy for yet another four years.
Obama	0	Or this time, we can recognize that you can't be the champion of working Americans if you're funded by the lobbyists who drown out their voices.
Obama	0	We can do what we've done in this campaign, and say that we won't take a dime of their money.
Obama	0	We can do what I did in Illinois, and in Washington, and bring both parties together to rein in their power so we can take our government back.
Obama	0	It's our choice.
Obama	0	We can be a party that thinks the only way to look tough on national security is to talk, and act, and vote like George Bush and John McCain.
Obama	0	We can use fear as a tactic, and the threat of terrorism to scare up votes.
Obama	0	Or we can decide that real strength is asking the tough questions before we send our troops to fight.
Obama	0	We can see the threats we face for what they are - a call to rally all Americans and all the world against the common challenges of the 21st century - terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease.
Obama	0	That's what it takes to keep us safe in the world.
Obama	0	That's the real legacy of Roosevelt and Kennedy and Truman.
Obama	0	We can be a party that says and does whatever it takes to win the next election.
Obama	0	We can calculate and poll-test our positions and tell everyone exactly what they want to hear.
Obama	0	Or we can be the party that doesn't just focus on how to win but why we should.
Obama	0	We can tell everyone what they need to hear about the challenges we face.
Obama	0	We can seek to regain not just an office, but the trust of the American people that their leaders in Washington will tell them the truth.
Obama	0	That's the choice in this election.
Obama	0	We can be a party of those who only think like we do and only agree with all our positions.
Obama	0	We can continue to slice and dice this country into Red States and Blue States.
Obama	0	We can exploit the divisions that exist in our country for pure political gain.
Obama	0	Or this time, we can build on the movement we've started in this campaign - a movement that's united Democrats, Independents, and Republicans; a movement of young and old, rich and poor; white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American.
Obama	0	Because one thing I know from traveling to forty-six states this campaign season is that we're not as divided as our politics suggests.
Obama	0	We may have different stories and different backgrounds, but we hold common hopes for the future of this country.
Obama	0	In the end, this election is still our best chance to solve the problems we've been talking about for decades - as one nation; as one people.
Obama	0	Fourteen months later, that is still what this election is about.
Obama	0	Millions of Americans who believe we can do better - that we must do better - have put us in a position to bring about real change.
Obama	0	Now it's up to you, Indiana.
Obama	0	You can decide whether we're going to travel the same worn path, or whether we chart a new course that offers real hope for the future.
Obama	0	During the course of this campaign, we've all learned what my wife reminds me of all the time - that I am not a perfect man.
Obama	0	And I will not be a perfect President.
Obama	0	And so while I will always listen to you, and be honest with you, and fight for you every single day for the next for years, I will also ask you to be a part of the change that we need.
Obama	0	Because in my two decades of public service to this country, I have seen time and time again that real change doesn't begin in the halls of Washington, but on the streets of America.
Obama	0	It doesn't happen from the top-down, it happens from the bottom-up.
Obama	0	I also know that real change has never been easy, and it won't be easy this time either.
Obama	0	The status quo in Washington will fight harder than they ever have to divide us and distract us with ads and attacks from now until November.
Obama	0	But don't ever forget that you have the power to change this country.
Obama	0	You can make this election about how we're going to help those workers in Logansport; how we're going to re-train them, and educate them, and make our workforce competitive in a global economy.
Obama	0	You can make this election about how we're going to make health care affordable for that family in North Carolina; how we're going to help those families sitting around the kitchen table tonight pay their bills and stay in their homes.
Obama	0	You can make this election about how we plan to leave our children and all children a planet that's safer and a world that still sees America the same way my father saw it from across the ocean - as a beacon of all that is good and all that is possible for all mankind.
Obama	0	It is now our turn to follow in the footsteps of all those generations who sacrificed and struggled and faced down the greatest odds to perfect our improbable union.
Obama	0	And if we're willing to do what they did; if we're willing to shed our cynicism and our doubts and our fears; if we're willing to believe in what's possible again; then I believe that we won't just win this primary election, we won't just win this election in November, we will change this country, and keep this country's promise alive in the twenty-first century.
Obama	0	Thank you, and may God Bless the United States of America.
Obama	0	AP Annual Luncheon Washington, DC April 14, 2008  Editor’s note: The week before this speech, Obama was caught in an uncharacteristic moment of loose language.
Obama	0	Referring to working-class voters in old industrial towns impacted by job losses, the presidential hopeful said: "They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment, as a way to explain their frustrations."
Obama	0	Good afternoon.
Obama	0	I know I kept a lot of you guys busy this weekend with the comments I made last week.
Obama	0	Some of you might even be a little bitter about that.
Obama	0	As I said yesterday, I regret some of the words I chose, partly because the way that these remarks have been interpreted have offended some people and partly because they have served as one more distraction from the critical debate that we must have in this election season.
Obama	0	I'm a person of deep faith, and my religion has sustained me through a lot in my life.
Obama	0	I even gave a speech on faith before I ever started running for President where I said that Democrats, "make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives."
Obama	0	I also represent a state with a large number of hunters and sportsmen, and I understand how important these traditions are to families in Illinois and all across America.
Obama	0	And, contrary to what my poor word choices may have implied or my opponents have suggested, I've never believed that these traditions or people's faith has anything to do with how much money they have.
Obama	0	But I will never walk away from the larger point that I was trying to make.
Obama	0	For the last several decades, people in small towns and cities and rural areas all across this country have seen globalization change the rules of the game on them.
Obama	0	When I began my career as an organizer on the South Side of Chicago, I saw what happens when the local steel mill shuts its doors and moves overseas.
Obama	0	You don't just lose the jobs in the mill, you start losing jobs and businesses throughout the community.
Obama	0	The streets are emptier.
Obama	0	The schools suffer.
Obama	0	I saw it during my campaign for the Senate in Illinois when I'd talk to union guys who had worked at the local Maytag plant for twenty, thirty years before being laid off at fifty-five years old when it picked up and moved to Mexico; and they had no idea what they're going to do without the paycheck or the pension that they counted on.
Obama	0	One man didn't even know if he'd be able to afford the liver transplant his son needed now that his health care was gone.
Obama	0	I've heard these stories almost every day during this campaign, whether it was in Iowa or Ohio or Pennsylvania.
Obama	0	And the people I've met have also told me that every year, in every election, politicians come to their towns, and they tell them what they want to hear, and they make big promises, and then they go back to Washington when the campaign's over, and nothing changes.
Obama	0	There's no plan to address the downside of globalization.
Obama	0	We don't do anything about the skyrocketing cost of health care or college or those disappearing pensions.
Obama	0	Instead of fighting to replace jobs that aren't coming back, Washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week.
Obama	0	And after years and years and years of this, a lot of people in this country have become cynical about what government can do to improve their lives.
Obama	0	They are angry and frustrated with their leaders for not listening to them; for not fighting for them; for not always telling them the truth.
Obama	0	And yes, they are bitter about that.
Obama	0	Now, Senator McCain and the Republicans in Washington are already looking ahead to the fall and have decided that they plan on using these comments to argue that I'm out of touch with what's going on in the lives of working Americans.
Obama	0	I don't blame them for this -- that's the nature of our political culture, and if I had to carry the banner for eight years of George Bush's failures, I'd be looking for something else to talk about too.
Obama	0	But I will say this.
Obama	0	If John McCain wants to turn this election into a contest about which party is out of touch with the struggles and the hopes of working America, that's a debate I'm happy to have.
Obama	0	In fact, I think that's a debate we need to have.
Obama	0	Because I believe that the real insult to the millions of hard-working Americans out there would be a continuation of the economic agenda that has dominated Washington for far too long.
Obama	0	I may have made a mistake last week in the words that I chose, but the other party has made a much more damaging mistake in the failed policies they've chosen and the bankrupt philosophy they've embraced for the last three decades.
Obama	0	It's a philosophy that says there's no role for government in making the global economy work for working Americas; that we have to just sit back watch those factories close and those jobs disappear; that there's nothing we can do or should do about workers without health care, or children in crumbling schools, or families who are losing their homes, and so we should just hand out a few tax breaks and wish everyone the best of luck.
Obama	0	Ronald Reagan called this trickle-down economics.
Obama	0	George Bush called it the Ownership Society.
Obama	0	But what it really means is that you're on your own.
Obama	0	If your premiums or your tuition is rising faster than you can afford, you're on your own.
Obama	0	If you're that Maytag worker who just lost his pension, tough luck.
Obama	0	If you're a child born into poverty, you'll just have to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.
Obama	0	This philosophy isn't just out-of-touch - it's put our economy out-of-whack.
Obama	0	Years of pain on Main Street have finally trickled up to Wall Street and sent us hurtling toward recession, reminding us that we're all connected - that we can't prosper as a nation where a few people are doing well and everyone else is struggling.
Obama	0	John McCain is an American hero and a worthy opponent, but he's proven time and time again that he just doesn't understand this.
Obama	0	It took him three tries in seven days just to figure out that the home foreclosure crisis was an actual problem.
Obama	0	He's had a front row seat to the last eight years of disastrous policies that have widened the income gap and saddled our children with debt, and now he's promising four more years of the very same thing.
Obama	0	He's promising to make permanent the Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest few who didn't need them and didn't ask for them - tax breaks that are so irresponsible that John McCain himself once said they offended his conscience.
Obama	0	He's promising four more years of trade deals that don't have a single safeguard for American workers - that don't help American workers compete and win in a global economy.
Obama	0	He's promising four more years of an Administration that will push for the privatization of Social Security - a plan that would gamble away people's retirement on the stock market; a plan that was already rejected by Democrats and Republicans under George Bush.
Obama	0	He's promising four more years of policies that won't guarantee health insurance for working Americans; that won't bring down the rising cost of college tuition; that won't do a thing for the Americans who are living in those communities where the jobs have left and the factories have shut their doors.
Obama	0	And yet, despite all this, the other side is still betting that the American people won't notice that John McCain is running for George Bush's third term.
Obama	0	They think that they'll forget about all that's happened in the last eight years; that they'll be tricked into believing that it's either me or our party is the one that's out of touch with what's going on in their lives.
Obama	0	Well I'm making a different bet.
Obama	0	I'm betting on the American people.
Obama	0	The men and women I've met in small towns and big cities across this country see this election as a defining moment in our history.
Obama	0	They understand what's at stake here because they're living it every day.
Obama	0	And they are tired of being distracted by fake controversies.
Obama	0	They are fed up with politicians trying to divide us for their own political gain.
Obama	0	And I believe they'll see through the tactics that are used every year, in every election, to appeal to our fears, or our biases, or our differences - because they've never wanted or needed change as badly as they do now.
Obama	0	The people I've met during this campaign know that government cannot solve all of our problems, and they don't expect it to.
Obama	0	They don't want our tax dollars wasted on programs that don't work or perks for special interests who don't work for us.
Obama	0	They understand that we cannot stop every job from going overseas or build a wall around our economy, and they know that we shouldn't.
Obama	0	But they believe it's finally time that we make health care affordable and available for every single American; that we bring down costs for workers and for businesses; that we cut premiums, and stop insurance companies from denying people care or coverage who need it most.
Obama	0	They believe it's time we provided real relief to the victims of this housing crisis; that we help families refinance their mortgage so they can stay in their homes; that we start giving tax relief to the people who actually need it - middle-class families, and seniors, and struggling homeowners.
Obama	0	They believe that we can and should make the global economy work for working Americans; that we might not be able to stop every job from going overseas, but we certainly can stop giving tax breaks to companies who send them their and start giving tax breaks to companies who create good jobs right here in America.
Obama	0	We can invest in the types of renewable energy that won't just reduce our dependence on oil and save our planet, but create up to five million new jobs that can't be outsourced.
Obama	0	They believe we can train our workers for those new jobs, and keep the most productive workforce the most competitive workforce in the world if we fix our public education system by investing in what works and finding out what doesn't; if we invest in early childhood education and finally make college affordable for everyone who wants to go; if we stop talking about how great our teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness.
Obama	0	They believe that if you work your entire life, you deserve to retire with dignity and respect, which means a pension you can count on, and Social Security that's always there.
Obama	0	This is what the people I've met believe about the country they love.
Obama	0	It doesn't matter if they're Democrats or Republicans; whether they're from the smallest towns or the biggest cities; whether they hunt or they don't; whether they go to church, or temple, or mosque, or not.
Obama	0	We may come from different places and have different stories, but we share common hopes, and one very American dream.
Obama	0	That is the dream I am running to help restore in this election.
Obama	0	If I get the chance, that is what I'll be talking about from now until November.
Obama	0	That is the choice that I'll offer the American people - four more years of what we had for the last eight, or fundamental change in Washington.
Obama	0	People may be bitter about their leaders and the state of our politics, but beneath that, they are hopeful about what's possible in America.
Obama	0	That's why they leave their homes on their day off, or their jobs after a long day of work, and travel - sometimes for miles, sometimes in the bitter cold - to attend a rally or a town hall meeting held by Senator Clinton, or Senator McCain, or myself.
Obama	0	Because they believe that we can change things.
Obama	0	Because they believe in that dream.
Obama	0	I know something about that dream.
Obama	0	I wasn't born into a lot of money.
Obama	0	I was raised by a single mother with the help my grandparents, who grew up in small-town Kansas, went to school on the GI Bill, and bought their home through an FHA loan.
Obama	0	My mother had to use food stamps at one point, but she still made sure that through scholarships, I got a chance to go to some of the best schools around, which helped me get into some of the best colleges around, which gave me loans that Michelle and I just finished paying not all that many years ago.
Obama	0	In other words, my story is a quintessentially American story.
Obama	0	It's the same story that has made this country a beacon for the world-a story of struggle and sacrifice on the part of my forebearers and a story overcoming great odds.
Obama	0	I carry that story with me each and every day, It's why I wake up every day and do this, and it's why I continue to hold such hope for the future of a country where the dreams of its people have always been possible.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	A More Perfect Union “The Race Speech” Philadelphia, PA March 18, 2008  "We the people, in order to form a more perfect union."
Obama	0	Two hundred and twenty one years ago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with these simple words, launched America's improbable experiment in democracy.
Obama	0	Farmers and scholars; statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787.
Obama	0	The document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished.
Obama	0	It was stained by this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least twenty more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations.
Obama	0	Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution - a Constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty, and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time.
Obama	0	And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States.
Obama	0	What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part - through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk - to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time.
Obama	0	This was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this campaign - to continue the long march of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal, more free, more caring and more prosperous America.
Obama	0	I chose to run for the presidency at this moment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together - unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction - towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren.
Obama	0	This belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the American people.
Obama	0	But it also comes from my own American story.
Obama	0	I am the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas.
Obama	0	I was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton's Army during World War II and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworth while he was overseas.
Obama	0	I've gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world's poorest nations.
Obama	0	I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slaveowners - an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters.
Obama	0	I have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles and cousins, of every race and every hue, scattered across three continents, and for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible.
Obama	0	It's a story that hasn't made me the most conventional candidate.
Obama	0	But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts - that out of many, we are truly one.
Obama	0	Throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we saw how hungry the American people were for this message of unity.
Obama	0	Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country.
Obama	0	In South Carolina, where the Confederate Flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans.
Obama	0	This is not to say that race has not been an issue in the campaign.
Obama	0	At various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either "too black" or "not black enough."
Obama	0	We saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary.
Obama	0	The press has scoured every exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well.
Obama	0	And yet, it has only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn.
Obama	0	On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on the desire of wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap.
Obama	0	On the other end, we've heard my former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation; that rightly offend white and black alike.
Obama	0	I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy.
Obama	0	For some, nagging questions remain.
Obama	0	Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy?
Obama	0	Of course.
Obama	0	Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church?
Obama	0	Yes.
Obama	0	Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views?
Obama	0	Absolutely - just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed.
Obama	0	But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial.
Obama	0	They weren't simply a religious leader's effort to speak out against perceived injustice.
Obama	0	Instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country - a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel, instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam.
Obama	0	As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems - two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic health care crisis and potentially devastating climate change; problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all.
Obama	0	Given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough.
Obama	0	Why associate myself with Reverend Wright in the first place, they may ask?
Obama	0	Why not join another church?
Obama	0	And I confess that if all that I knew of Reverend Wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television and You Tube, or if Trinity United Church of Christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators, there is no doubt that I would react in much the same way But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man.
Obama	0	The man I met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another; to care for the sick and lift up the poor.
Obama	0	He is a man who served his country as a U.S. Marine; who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, and who for over thirty years led a church that serves the community by doing God's work here on Earth - by housing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries, and reaching out to those suffering from HIV/AIDS.
Obama	0	In my first book, Dreams From My Father, I described the experience of my first service at Trinity: "People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend's voice up into the rafters....And in that single note - hope!
Obama	0	- I heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones.
Obama	0	Those stories - of survival, and freedom, and hope - became our story, my story; the blood that had spilled was our blood, the tears our tears; until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world.
Obama	0	Our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal, black and more than black; in chronicling our journey, the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didn't need to feel shame about...memories that all people might study and cherish - and with which we could start to rebuild."
Obama	0	That has been my experience at Trinity.
Obama	0	Like other predominantly black churches across the country, Trinity embodies the black community in its entirety - the doctor and the welfare mom, the model student and the former gang-banger.
Obama	0	Like other black churches, Trinity's services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor.
Obama	0	They are full of dancing, clapping, screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear.
Obama	0	The church contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and yes, the bitterness and bias that make up the black experience in America.
Obama	0	And this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with Reverend Wright.
Obama	0	As imperfect as he may be, he has been like family to me.
Obama	0	He strengthened my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children.
Obama	0	Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms, or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect.
Obama	0	He contains within him the contradictions - the good and the bad - of the community that he has served diligently for so many years.
Obama	0	I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community.
Obama	0	I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother - a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.
Obama	0	These people are a part of me.
Obama	0	And they are a part of America, this country that I love.
Obama	0	Some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable.
Obama	0	I can assure you it is not.
Obama	0	I suppose the politically safe thing would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork.
Obama	0	We can dismiss Reverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraro, in the aftermath of her recent statements, as harboring some deep-seated racial bias.
Obama	0	But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now.
Obama	0	We would be making the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America - to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality.
Obama	0	The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through - a part of our union that we have yet to perfect.
Obama	0	And if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care, or education, or the need to find good jobs for every American.
Obama	0	Understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point.
Obama	0	As William Faulkner once wrote, "The past isn't dead and buried.
Obama	0	In fact, it isn't even past."
Obama	0	We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country.
Obama	0	But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African-American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.
Obama	0	Segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools; we still haven't fixed them, fifty years after Brown v. Board of Education, and the inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's black and white students.
Obama	0	Legalized discrimination - where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or the police force, or fire departments - meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations.
Obama	0	That history helps explain the wealth and income gap between black and white, and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persists in so many of today's urban and rural communities.
Obama	0	A lack of economic opportunity among black men, and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for one's family, contributed to the erosion of black families - a problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened.
Obama	0	And the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods - parks for kids to play in, police walking the beat, regular garbage pick-up and building code enforcement - all helped create a cycle of violence, blight and neglect that continue to haunt us.
Obama	0	This is the reality in which Reverend Wright and other African-Americans of his generation grew up.
Obama	0	They came of age in the late fifties and early sixties, a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted.
Obama	0	What's remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination, but rather how many men and women overcame the odds; how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would come after them.
Obama	0	But for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream, there were many who didn't make it - those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination.
Obama	0	That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations - those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future.
Obama	0	Even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race, and racism, continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways.
Obama	0	For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years.
Obama	0	That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends.
Obama	0	But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table.
Obama	0	At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failings.
Obama	0	And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews.
Obama	0	The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning.
Obama	0	That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change.
Obama	0	But the anger is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races.
Obama	0	In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community.
Obama	0	Most working- and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race.
Obama	0	Their experience is the immigrant experience - as far as they're concerned, no one's handed them anything, they've built it from scratch.
Obama	0	They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor.
Obama	0	They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense.
Obama	0	So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time.
Obama	0	Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company.
Obama	0	But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation.
Obama	0	Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition.
Obama	0	Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends.
Obama	0	Talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism.
Obama	0	Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze - a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favor the few over the many.
Obama	0	And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns - this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding.
Obama	0	This is where we are right now.
Obama	0	It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years.
Obama	0	Contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, I have never been so naïve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle, or with a single candidacy - particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own.
Obama	0	But I have asserted a firm conviction - a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American people - that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds, and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union.
Obama	0	For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past.
Obama	0	It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of American life.
Obama	0	But it also means binding our particular grievances - for better health care, and better schools, and better jobs - to the larger aspirations of all Americans -- the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man whose been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family.
Obama	0	And it means taking full responsibility for own lives - by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, and reading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism; they must always believe that they can write their own destiny.
Obama	0	Ironically, this quintessentially American - and yes, conservative - notion of self-help found frequent expression in Reverend Wright's sermons.
Obama	0	But what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that society can change.
Obama	0	The profound mistake of Reverend Wright's sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society.
Obama	0	It's that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress has been made; as if this country - a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black; Latino and Asian, rich and poor, young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past.
Obama	0	But what we know -- what we have seen - is that America can change.
Obama	0	That is true genius of this nation.
Obama	0	What we have already achieved gives us hope - the audacity to hope - for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.
Obama	0	In the white community, the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people; that the legacy of discrimination - and current incidents of discrimination, while less overt than in the past - are real and must be addressed.
Obama	0	Not just with words, but with deeds - by investing in our schools and our communities; by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system; by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations.
Obama	0	It requires all Americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams; that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of America prosper.
Obama	0	In the end, then, what is called for is nothing more, and nothing less, than what all the world's great religions demand - that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.
Obama	0	Let us be our brother's keeper, Scripture tells us.
Obama	0	Let us be our sister's keeper.
Obama	0	Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.
Obama	0	For we have a choice in this country.
Obama	0	We can accept a politics that breeds division, and conflict, and cynicism.
Obama	0	We can tackle race only as spectacle - as we did in the OJ trial - or in the wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina - or as fodder for the nightly news.
Obama	0	We can play Reverend Wright's sermons on every channel, every day and talk about them from now until the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the American people think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words.
Obama	0	We can pounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card, or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general election regardless of his policies.
Obama	0	We can do that.
Obama	0	But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election, we'll be talking about some other distraction.
Obama	0	And then another one.
Obama	0	And then another one.
Obama	0	And nothing will change.
Obama	0	That is one option.
Obama	0	Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, "Not this time."
Obama	0	This time we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native American children.
Obama	0	This time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kids who don't look like us are somebody else's problem.
Obama	0	The children of America are not those kids, they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st century economy.
Obama	0	Not this time.
Obama	0	This time we want to talk about how the lines in the Emergency Room are filled with whites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care; who don't have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we do it together.
Obama	0	This time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans from every religion, every region, every walk of life.
Obama	0	This time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might take your job; it's that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit.
Obama	0	This time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who serve together, and fight together, and bleed together under the same proud flag.
Obama	0	We want to talk about how to bring them home from a war that never should've been authorized and never should've been waged, and we want to talk about how we'll show our patriotism by caring for them, and their families, and giving them the benefits they have earned.
Obama	0	I would not be running for President if I didn't believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of Americans want for this country.
Obama	0	This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected.
Obama	0	And today, whenever I find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope is the next generation - the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election.
Obama	0	There is one story in particularly that I'd like to leave you with today - a story I told when I had the great honor of speaking on Dr. King's birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, in Atlanta.
Obama	0	There is a young, twenty-three year old white woman named Ashley Baia who organized for our campaign in Florence, South Carolina.
Obama	0	She had been working to organize a mostly African-American community since the beginning of this campaign, and one day she was at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why they were there.
Obama	0	And Ashley said that when she was nine years old, her mother got cancer.
Obama	0	And because she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost her health care.
Obama	0	They had to file for bankruptcy, and that's when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom.
Obama	0	She knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches.
Obama	0	Because that was the cheapest way to eat.
Obama	0	She did this for a year until her mom got better, and she told everyone at the roundtable that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help the millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too.
Obama	0	Now Ashley might have made a different choice.
Obama	0	Perhaps somebody told her along the way that the source of her mother's problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy to work, or Hispanics who were coming into the country illegally.
Obama	0	But she didn't.
Obama	0	She sought out allies in her fight against injustice.
Obama	0	Anyway, Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they're supporting the campaign.
Obama	0	They all have different stories and reasons.
Obama	0	Many bring up a specific issue.
Obama	0	And finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sitting there quietly the entire time.
Obama	0	And Ashley asks him why he's there.
Obama	0	And he does not bring up a specific issue.
Obama	0	He does not say health care or the economy.
Obama	0	He does not say education or the war.
Obama	0	He does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama.
Obama	0	He simply says to everyone in the room, "I am here because of Ashley."
Obama	0	"I'm here because of Ashley."
Obama	0	By itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not enough.
Obama	0	It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the jobless, or education to our children.
Obama	0	But it is where we start.
Obama	0	It is where our union grows stronger.
Obama	0	And as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the two-hundred and twenty one years since a band of patriots signed that document in Philadelphia, that is where the perfection begins.
Obama	0	March 4th Primary Night Texas and Ohio San Antonio, TX March 4, 2008  Well, we are in the middle of a very close race right now in Texas, and we may not even know the final results until morning.
Obama	0	We do know that Senator Clinton has won Rhode Island, and while there are a lot of votes to be counted in Ohio, it looks like she did well there too, and so we congratulate her on those states.
Obama	0	We also know that we have won the state of Vermont.
Obama	0	And we know this - no matter what happens tonight, we have nearly the same delegate lead as we did this morning, and we are on our way to winning this nomination.
Obama	0	You know, decades ago, as a community organizer, I learned that the real work of democracy begins far from the closed doors and marbled halls of Washington.
Obama	0	It begins on street corners and front porches; in living rooms and meeting halls with ordinary Americans who see the world as it is and realize that we have it within our power to remake the world as it should be.
Obama	0	It is with that hope that we began this unlikely journey - the hope that if we could go block by block, city by city, state by state and build a movement that spanned race and region; party and gender; if we could give young people a reason to vote and the young at heart a reason to believe again; if we could inspire a nation to come together again, then we could turn the page on the politics that's shut us out, let us down, and told us to settle.
Obama	0	We could write a new chapter in the American story.
Obama	0	We were told this wasn't possible.
Obama	0	We were told the climb was too steep.
Obama	0	We were told our country was too cynical - that we were just being naïve; that we couldn't really change the world as it is.
Obama	0	But then a few people in Iowa stood up to say, "Yes we can."
Obama	0	And then a few more of you stood up from the hills of New Hampshire to the coast of South Carolina.
Obama	0	And then a few million of you stood up from Savannah to Seattle; from Boise to Baton Rouge.
Obama	0	And tonight, because of you - because of a movement you built that stretches from Vermont's Green Mountains to the streets of San Antonio, we can stand up with confidence and clarity to say that we are turning the page, and we are ready to write the next great chapter in America's story.
Obama	0	In the coming weeks, we will begin a great debate about the future of this country with a man who has served it bravely and loves it dearly.
Obama	0	And tonight, I called John McCain and congratulated him on winning the Republican nomination.
Obama	0	But in this election, we will offer two very different visions of the America we see in the twenty-first century.
Obama	0	Because John McCain may claim long history of straight talk and independent-thinking, and I respect that.
Obama	0	But in this campaign, he's fallen in line behind the very same policies that have ill-served America.
Obama	0	He has seen where George Bush has taken our country, and he promises to keep us on the very same course.
Obama	0	It's the same course that threatens a century of war in Iraq - a third and fourth and fifth tour of duty for brave troops who've done all we've asked them to, even while we ask little and expect nothing of the Iraqi government whose job it is to put their country back together.
Obama	0	A course where we spend billions of dollars a week that could be used to rebuild our roads and our schools; to care for our veterans and send our children to college.
Obama	0	It's the same course that continues to divide and isolate America from the world by substituting bluster and bullying for direct diplomacy - by ignoring our allies and refusing to talk to our enemies even though Presidents from Kennedy to Reagan have done just that; because strong countries and strong leaders aren't afraid to tell hard truths to petty dictators.
Obama	0	And it's the same course that offers the same tired answer to workers without health care and families without homes; to students in debt and children who go to bed hungry in the richest nation on Earth - four more years of tax breaks for the biggest corporations and the wealthiest few who don't need them and aren't even asking for them.
Obama	0	It's a course that further divides Wall Street from Main Street; where struggling families are told to pull themselves up by their bootstraps because there's nothing government can do or should do - and so we should give more to those with the most and let the chips fall where they may.
Obama	0	Well we are here tonight to say that this is not the America we believe in and this is not the future we want.
Obama	0	We want a new course for this country.
Obama	0	We want new leadership in Washington.
Obama	0	We want change in America.
Obama	0	John McCain and Senator Clinton echo each other in dismissing this call for change.
Obama	0	They say it is eloquent but empty; speeches and not solutions.
Obama	0	And yet, they should know that it's a call that did not begin with my words.
Obama	0	It began with words that were spoken on the floors of factories in Ohio and across the deep plains of Texas; words that came from classrooms in South Carolina and living rooms in the state of Iowa; from first-time voters and life-long cynics; from Democrats and Republicans alike.
Obama	0	They should know that there's nothing empty about the call for affordable health care that came from the young student who told me she gets three hours of sleep because she works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't pay her sister's medical bills.
Obama	0	There's nothing empty about the call for help that came from the mother in San Antonio who saw her mortgage double in two weeks and didn't know where her two-year olds would sleep at night when they were kicked out of their home.
Obama	0	There's nothing empty about the call for change that came from the elderly woman who wants it so badly that she sent me an envelope with a money order for $3.01 and a simple verse of scripture tucked inside.
Obama	0	These Americans know that government cannot solve all of our problems, and they don't expect it to.
Obama	0	Americans know that we have to work harder and study more to compete in a global economy.
Obama	0	We know that we need to take responsibility for ourselves and our children - that we need to spend more time with them, and teach them well, and put a book in their hands instead of a video game once in awhile.
Obama	0	We know this.
Obama	0	But we also believe that there is a larger responsibility we have to one another as Americans.
Obama	0	We believe that we rise or fall as one nation - as one people.
Obama	0	That we are our brother's keeper.
Obama	0	That we are our sister's keeper.
Obama	0	We believe that a child born tonight should have the same chances whether she arrives in the barrios of San Antonio or the suburbs of St. Louis; on the streets of Chicago or the hills of Appalachia.
Obama	0	We believe that when she goes to school for the first time, it should be in a place where the rats don't outnumber the computers; that when she applies to college, cost is no barrier to a degree that will allow her to compete with children in China or India for the jobs of the twenty-first century.
Obama	0	We believe that these jobs should provide wages that can raise her family, health care for when she gets sick and a pension for when she retires.
Obama	0	We believe that when she tucks her own children into bed, she should feel safe knowing that they are protected from the threats we face by the bravest, best-equipped, military in the world, led by a Commander-in-Chief who has the judgment to know when to send them into battle and which battlefield to fight on.
Obama	0	And if that child should ever get the chance to travel the world, and someone should ask her where she is from, we believe that she should always be able to hold her head high with pride in her voice when she answers "I am an American."
Obama	0	That is the course we seek.
Obama	0	That is the change we are calling for.
Obama	0	You can call it many things, but you cannot call it empty.
Obama	0	If I am the nominee of this party, I will not allow us to be distracted by the same politics that seeks to divide us with false charges and meaningless labels.
Obama	0	In this campaign, we will not stand for the politics that uses religion as a wedge, and patriotism as a bludgeon.
Obama	0	I owe what I am to this country I love, and I will never forget it.
Obama	0	Where else could a young man who grew up herding goats in Kenya get the chance to fulfill his dream of a college education?
Obama	0	Where else could he marry a white girl from Kansas whose parents survived war and depression to find opportunity out west?
Obama	0	Where else could they have a child who would one day have the chance to run for the highest office in the greatest nation the world has ever known?
Obama	0	Where else, but in the United States of America?
Obama	0	It is now my hope and our task to set this country on a course that will keep this promise alive in the twenty-first century.
Obama	0	And the eyes of the world are watching to see if we can.
Obama	0	There is a young man on my campaign whose grandfather lives in Uganda.
Obama	0	He is 81 years old and has never experienced true democracy in his lifetime.
Obama	0	During the reign of Idi Amin, he was literally hunted and the only reason he escaped was thanks to the kindness of others and a few good-sized trunks.
Obama	0	And on the night of the Iowa caucuses, that 81-year-old man stayed up until five in the morning, huddled by his television, waiting for the results.
Obama	0	The world is watching what we do here.
Obama	0	The world is paying attention to how we conduct ourselves.
Obama	0	What will we they see?
Obama	0	What will we tell them?
Obama	0	What will we show them?
Obama	0	Can we come together across party and region; race and religion to restore prosperity and opportunity as the birthright of every American?
Obama	0	Can we lead the community of nations in taking on the common threats of the 21st century - terrorism and climate change; genocide and disease?
Obama	0	Can we send a message to all those weary travelers beyond our shores who long to be free from fear and want that the United States of America is, and always will be, ‘the last best, hope of Earth?
Obama	0	We say; we hope; we believe - yes we can.
Obama	0	Potomac Primary Night Madison, WI February 12, 2008 Today, the change we seek swept through the Chesapeake and over the Potomac.
Obama	0	We won the state of Maryland.
Obama	0	We won the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Obama	0	And though we won in Washington D.C., this movement won't stop until there's change in Washington.
Obama	0	And tonight, we're on our way.
Obama	0	But we know how much farther we have to go.
Obama	0	We know it takes more than one night – or even one election – to overcome decades of money and the influence; bitter partisanship and petty bickering that's shut you out, let you down and told you to settle.
Obama	0	We know our road will not be easy.
Obama	0	But we also know that at this moment the cynics can no longer say our hope is false.
Obama	0	We have now won east and west, north and south, and across the heartland of this country we love.
Obama	0	We have given young people a reason to believe, and brought folks back to the polls who want to believe again.
Obama	0	And we are bringing together Democrats and Independents and Republicans; blacks and whites; Latinos and Asians; small states and big states; Red States and Blue States into a United States of America.
Obama	0	This is the new American majority.
Obama	0	This is what change looks like when it happens from the bottom up.
Obama	0	And in this election, your voices will be heard.
Obama	0	Because at a time when so many people are struggling to keep up with soaring costs in a sluggish economy, we know that the status quo in Washington just won't do.
Obama	0	Not this time.
Obama	0	Not this year.
Obama	0	We can't keep playing the same Washington game with the same Washington players and expect a different result – because it's a game that ordinary Americans are losing.
Obama	0	It's a game where lobbyists write check after check and Exxon turns record profits, while you pay the price at the pump, and our planet is put at risk.
Obama	0	That's what happens when lobbyists set the agenda, and that's why they won't drown out your voices anymore when I am President of the United States of America.
Obama	0	It's a game where trade deals like NAFTA ship jobs overseas and force parents to compete with their teenagers to work for minimum wage at Wal-Mart.
Obama	0	That's what happens when the American worker doesn't have a voice at the negotiating table, when leaders change their positions on trade with the politics of the moment, and that's why we need a President who will listen to Main Street – not just Wall Street; a President who will stand with workers not just when it's easy, but when it's hard.
Obama	0	It's a game where Democrats and Republicans fail to come together year after year after year, while another mother goes without health care for her sick child.
Obama	0	That's why we have to put an end to the division and distraction in Washington, so that we can unite this nation around a common purpose, a higher purpose.
Obama	0	It's a game where the only way for Democrats to look tough on national security is by talking, and acting and voting like Bush-McCain Republicans, while our troops are sent to fight tour after tour of duty in a war that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged.
Obama	0	That's what happens when we use 9/11 to scare up votes, and that's why we need to do more than end a war – we need to end the mindset that got us into war.
Obama	0	That's the choice in this primary.
Obama	0	It's about whether we choose to play the game, or whether we choose to end it; it's change that polls well, or change we can believe in; it's the past versus the future.
Obama	0	And when I'm the Democratic nominee for President – that will be the choice in November.
Obama	0	John McCain is an American hero.
Obama	0	We honor his service to our nation.
Obama	0	But his priorities don't address the real problems of the American people, because they are bound to the failed policies of the past.
Obama	0	George Bush won't be on the ballot this November, but his war and his tax cuts for the wealthy will.
Obama	0	When I am the nominee, I will offer a clear choice.
Obama	0	John McCain won't be able to say that I ever supported this war in Iraq, because I opposed it from the beginning.
Obama	0	Senator McCain said the other day that we might be mired for a hundred years in Iraq, which is reason enough to not give him four years in the White House.
Obama	0	If we had chosen a different path, the right path, we could have finished the job in Afghanistan, and put more resources into the fight against bin Laden; and instead of spending hundreds of billions of dollars in Baghdad, we could have put that money into our schools and hospitals, our road and bridges – and that's what the American people need us to do right now.
Obama	0	And I admired Senator McCain when he stood up and said that it offended his "conscience" to support the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy in a time of war; that he couldn't support a tax cut where "so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate."
Obama	0	But somewhere along the road to the Republican nomination, the Straight Talk Express lost its wheels, because now he's all for them.
Obama	0	Well I'm not.
Obama	0	We can't keep spending money that we don't have in a war that we shouldn't have fought.
Obama	0	We can't keep mortgaging our children's future on a mountain of debt.
Obama	0	We can't keep driving a wider and wider gap between the few who are rich and the rest who struggle to keep pace.
Obama	0	It's time to turn the page.
Obama	0	We need a new direction in this country.
Obama	0	Everywhere I go, I meet Americans who can't wait another day for change.
Obama	0	They're not just showing up to hear a speech – they need to know that politics can make a difference in their lives, that it's not too late to reclaim the American Dream.
Obama	0	It's a dream shared in big cities and small towns; across races, regions and religions – that if you work hard, you can support a family; that if you get sick, there will be health care you can afford; that you can retire with the dignity and security and respect that you have earned; that your kids can get a good education, and young people can go to college even if they're not rich.
Obama	0	That is our common hope.
Obama	0	That is the American Dream.
Obama	0	It's the dream of the father who goes to work before dawn and lies awake at night wondering how he's going to pay the bills.
Obama	0	He needs us to restore fairness to our economy by putting a tax cut into the pockets of working people, and seniors, and struggling homeowners.
Obama	0	It's the dream of the woman who told me she works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill. She needs us to finally come together to make health care affordable and available for every American.
Obama	0	It's the dream of the senior I met who lost his pension when the company he gave his life to went bankrupt.
Obama	0	He doesn't need bankruptcy laws that protect banks and big lenders.
Obama	0	He needs us to protect pensions, not CEO bonuses; and to do what it takes to make sure that the American people can count on Social Security today, tomorrow and forever.
Obama	0	It's the dream of the teacher who works at Dunkin Donuts after school just to make ends meet.
Obama	0	She needs better pay, and more support, and the freedom to do more than just teach to the test.
Obama	0	And if her students want to go on to college, they shouldn't fear decades of debt.
Obama	0	That's why I'll make college affordable with an annual $4,000 tax credit if you're willing to do community service, or national service.
Obama	0	We will invest in you, but we'll ask you to invest in your country.
Obama	0	That is our calling in this campaign.
Obama	0	To reaffirm that fundamental belief – I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper – that makes us one people, and one nation.
Obama	0	It's time to stand up and reach for what's possible, because together, people who love their country can change it.
Obama	0	Now when I start talking like this, some folks tell me that I've got my head in the clouds.
Obama	0	That I need a reality check.
Obama	0	That we're still offering false hope.
Obama	0	But my own story tells me that in the United States of America, there has never been anything false about hope.
Obama	0	I should not be here today.
Obama	0	I was not born into money or status.
Obama	0	I was born to a teenage mom in Hawaii, and my dad left us when I was two.
Obama	0	But my family gave me love, they gave me education, and most of all they gave me hope – hope that in America, no dream is beyond our grasp if we reach for it, and fight for it, and work for it.
Obama	0	Because hope is not blind optimism.
Obama	0	I know how hard it will be to make these changes.
Obama	0	I know this because I fought on the streets of Chicago as a community organizer to bring jobs to the jobless in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant.
Obama	0	I've fought in the courts as a civil rights lawyer to make sure people weren't denied their rights because of what they looked like or where they came from.
Obama	0	I've fought in the legislature to take power away from lobbyists.
Obama	0	I've won some of those fights, but I've lost some of them too.
Obama	0	I've seen good legislation die because good intentions weren't backed by a mandate for change.
Obama	0	The politics of hope does not mean hoping things come easy.
Obama	0	Because nothing worthwhile in this country has ever happened unless somebody, somewhere stood up when it was hard; stood up when they were told – no you can't, and said yes we can.
Obama	0	And where better to affirm our ideals than here in Wisconsin, where a century ago the progressive movement was born.
Obama	0	It was rooted in the principle that the voices of the people can speak louder than special interests; that citizens can be connected to their government and to one another; and that all of us share a common destiny, an American Dream.
Obama	0	Yes we can reclaim that dream.
Obama	0	Yes we can heal this nation.
Obama	0	The voices of the American people have carried us a great distance on this improbable journey, but we have much further to go.
Obama	0	Now we carry our message to farms and factories across this state, and to the cities and small towns of Ohio, to the open plains deep in the heart of Texas, and all the way to Democratic National Convention in Denver; it's the same message we had when we were up, and when were down; that out of many, we are one; that our destiny will not be written for us, but by us; and that we can cast off our doubts and fears and cynicism because our dream will not be deferred; our future will not be denied; and our time for change has come.
Obama	0	Super Tuesday Chicago, IL February 5, 2008   Before I begin, I just want to send my condolences to the victims of the storms that hit Tennessee and Arkansas.
Obama	0	They are in our thoughts and in our prayers.
Obama	0	Well, the polls are just closing in California and the votes are still being counted in cities and towns across the country.
Obama	0	But there is one thing on this February night that we do not need the final results to know - our time has come, our movement is real, and change is coming to America.
Obama	0	Only a few hundred miles from here, almost one year ago to the day, we stood on the steps of the Old State Capitol to reaffirm a truth that was spoken there so many generations ago - that a house divided cannot stand; that we are more than a collection of Red States and Blue States; we are, and always will be, the United States of America.
Obama	0	What began as a whisper in Springfield soon carried across the corn fields of Iowa, where farmers and factory workers; students and seniors stood up in numbers we've never seen.
Obama	0	They stood up to say that maybe this year, we don't have to settle for a politics where scoring points is more important than solving problems.
Obama	0	This time we can finally do something about health care we can't afford or mortgages we can't pay.
Obama	0	This time can be different.
Obama	0	Their voices echoed from the hills of New Hampshire to the deserts of Nevada, where teachers and cooks and kitchen workers stood up to say that maybe Washington doesn't have to be run by lobbyists anymore.
Obama	0	They reached the coast of South Carolina when people said that maybe we don't have to be divided by race and region and gender; that crumbling schools are stealing the future of black children and white children; that we can come together and build an America that gives every child, everywhere the opportunity to live their dreams.
Obama	0	This time can be different.
Obama	0	And today, on this Tuesday in February, in states North and South, East and West, what began as a whisper in Springfield has swelled to a chorus of millions calling for change.
Obama	0	A chorus that cannot be ignored.
Obama	0	That cannot be deterred.
Obama	0	This time can be different because this campaign for the presidency is different.
Obama	0	It's different not because of me, but because of you.
Obama	0	Because you are tired of being disappointed and tired of being let down.
Obama	0	You're tired of hearing promises made and plans proposed in the heat of a campaign only to have nothing change when everyone goes back to Washington.
Obama	0	Because the lobbyists just write another check.
Obama	0	Or because politicians start worrying about how they'll win the next election instead of why they should.
Obama	0	Or because they focus on who's up and who's down instead of who matters.
Obama	0	And while Washington is consumed with the same drama and division and distraction, another family puts up a For Sale sign in the front yard.
Obama	0	Another factory shuts its doors.
Obama	0	Another soldier waves goodbye as he leaves on another tour of duty in a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged.
Obama	0	It goes on and on and on.
Obama	0	But in this election - at this moment - you are standing up all across this country to say, not this time.
Obama	0	Not this year.
Obama	0	The stakes are too high and the challenges too great to play the same Washington game with the same Washington players and expect a different result.
Obama	0	This time must be different.
Obama	0	Now, this isn't about me and it's not about Senator Clinton.
Obama	0	As I've said before, she was a friend before this campaign and she'll be a friend after it's over.
Obama	0	I respect her as a colleague, and I congratulate her on her victories tonight.
Obama	0	But this fall we owe the American people a real choice.
Obama	0	It's change versus more of the same.
Obama	0	It's the future versus the past.
Obama	0	It's a choice between going into this election with Republicans and Independents already united against us, or going against their nominee with a campaign that has united Americans of all parties around a common purpose.
Obama	0	It's a choice between having a debate with the other party about who has the most experience in Washington, or having one about who's most likely to change Washington.
Obama	0	Because that's a debate we can win.
Obama	0	It's a choice between a candidate who's taken more money from Washington lobbyists than either Republican in this race, and a campaign that hasn't taken a dime of their money because we've been funded by you.
Obama	0	And if I am your nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that I voted for the war in Iraq; or that I gave George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; or that I support the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like.
Obama	0	And he will not be able to say that I wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it's ok for America to use torture - because it is never ok. That is the choice in this election.
Obama	0	The Republicans running for President have already tied themselves to the past.
Obama	0	They speak of a hundred year war in Iraq and billions more on tax breaks for the wealthiest few who don't need them and didn't ask for them - tax breaks that mortgage our children's future on a mountain of debt at a time when there are families who can't pay their medical bills and students who can't pay their tuition.
Obama	0	They are running on the politics of yesterday, and that is why our party must be the party of tomorrow.
Obama	0	And that is the party I will lead as President.
Obama	0	I'll be the President who ends the tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans who deserve it.
Obama	0	And struggling homeowners.
Obama	0	And seniors who should retire with dignity and respect.
Obama	0	I'll be the President who finally brings Democrats and Republicans together to make health care affordable and available for every single American.
Obama	0	We will put a college education within reach of anyone who wants to go, and instead of just talking about how great our teachers are, we will reward them for their greatness, with more pay and better support.
Obama	0	And we will harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all.
Obama	0	And when I am President, we will put an end to a politics that uses 9/11 as a way to scare up votes, and start seeing it as a challenge that should unite America and the world against the common threats of the twenty-first century: terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease.
Obama	0	We can do this.
Obama	0	It will not be easy.
Obama	0	It will require struggle and sacrifice.
Obama	0	There will setbacks and we will make mistakes.
Obama	0	And that is why we need all the help we can get.
Obama	0	So tonight I want to speak directly to all those Americans who have yet to join this movement but still hunger for change - we need you.
Obama	0	We need you to stand with us, and work with us, and help us prove that together, ordinary people can still do extraordinary things.
Obama	0	I am blessed to be standing in the city where my own extraordinary journey began.
Obama	0	A few miles from here, in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant, is where I learned what it takes to make change happen.
Obama	0	I was a young organizer then, intent on fighting joblessness and poverty on the South Side, and I still remember one of the very first meetings I put together.
Obama	0	We had worked on it for days, but no one showed up.
Obama	0	Our volunteers felt so defeated, they wanted to quit.
Obama	0	And to be honest, so did I.
Obama	0	But at that moment, I looked outside and saw some young boys tossing stones at a boarded-up apartment building across the street.
Obama	0	They were like boys in so many cities across the country - boys without prospects, without guidance, without hope.
Obama	0	And I turned to the volunteers, and I asked them, "Before you quit, I want you to answer one question.
Obama	0	What will happen to those boys?"
Obama	0	And the volunteers looked out that window, and they decided that night to keep going - to keep organizing, keep fighting for better schools, and better jobs, and better health care.
Obama	0	And so did I.
Obama	0	And slowly, but surely, in the weeks and months to come, the community began to change.
Obama	0	You see, the challenges we face will not be solved with one meeting in one night.
Obama	0	Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time.
Obama	0	We are the ones we've been waiting for.
Obama	0	We are the change that we seek.
Obama	0	We are the hope of those boys who have little; who've been told that they cannot have what they dream; that they cannot be what they imagine.
Obama	0	Yes they can.
Obama	0	We are the hope of the father who goes to work before dawn and lies awake with doubts that tell him he cannot give his children the same opportunities that someone gave him.
Obama	0	Yes he can.
Obama	0	We are the hope of the woman who hears that her city will not be rebuilt; that she cannot reclaim the life that was swept away in a terrible storm.
Obama	0	Yes she can.
Obama	0	We are the hope of the future; the answer to the cynics who tell us our house must stand divided; that we cannot come together; that we cannot remake this world as it should be.
Obama	0	Because we know what we have seen and what we believe - that what began as a whisper has now swelled to a chorus that cannot be ignored; that will not be deterred; that will ring out across this land as a hymn that will heal this nation, repair this world, and make this time different than all the rest - Yes.
Obama	0	We.
Obama	0	Can.
Obama	0	Iowa Caucus Night Des Moines, Iowa January 03, 2008 Thank you, Iowa.
Obama	0	You know, they said this day would never come.
Obama	0	They said our sights were set too high.
Obama	0	They said this country was too divided; too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose.
Obama	0	But on this January night - at this defining moment in history - you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do.
Obama	0	You have done what the state of New Hampshire can do in five days.
Obama	0	You have done what America can do in this New Year, 2008.
Obama	0	In lines that stretched around schools and churches; in small towns and big cities; you came together as Democrats, Republicans and Independents to stand up and say that we are one nation; we are one people; and our time for change has come.
Obama	0	You said the time has come to move beyond the bitterness and pettiness and anger that's consumed Washington; to end the political strategy that's been all about division and instead make it about addition - to build a coalition for change that stretches through Red States and Blue States.
Obama	0	Because that's how we'll win in November, and that's how we'll finally meet the challenges that we face as a nation.
Obama	0	We are choosing hope over fear.
Obama	0	We're choosing unity over division, and sending a powerful message that change is coming to America.
Obama	0	You said the time has come to tell the lobbyists who think their money and their influence speak louder than our voices that they don't own this government, we do; and we are here to take it back.
Obama	0	The time has come for a President who will be honest about the choices and the challenges we face; who will listen to you and learn from you even when we disagree; who won't just tell you what you want to hear, but what you need to know.
Obama	0	And in New Hampshire, if you give me the same chance that Iowa did tonight, I will be that president for America.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	I'll be a President who finally makes health care affordable and available to every single American the same way I expanded health care in Illinois – by bringing Democrats and Republicans together to get the job done.
Obama	0	I'll be a President who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut into the pockets of the working Americans who deserve it.
Obama	0	I'll be a President who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all.
Obama	0	And I'll be a President who ends this war in Iraq and finally brings our troops home; who restores our moral standing; who understands that 9/11 is not a way to scare up votes, but a challenge that should unite America and the world against the common threats of the twenty-first century; common threats of terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease.
Obama	0	Tonight, we are one step closer to that vision of America because of what you did here in Iowa.
Obama	0	And so I'd especially like to thank the organizers and the precinct captains; the volunteers and the staff who made this all possible.
Obama	0	And while I'm at it, on "thank yous," I think it makes sense for me to thank the love of my life, the rock of the Obama family, the closer on the campaign trail; give it up for Michelle Obama.
Obama	0	I know you didn't do this for me.
Obama	0	You did this-you did this because you believed so deeply in the most American of ideas - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love this country can change it.
Obama	0	know this-I know this because while I may be standing here tonight, I'll never forget that my journey began on the streets of Chicago doing what so many of you have done for this campaign and all the campaigns here in Iowa - organizing, and working, and fighting to make people's lives just a little bit better.
Obama	0	I know how hard it is.
Obama	0	It comes with little sleep, little pay, and a lot of sacrifice.
Obama	0	There are days of disappointment, but sometimes, just sometimes, there are nights like this - a night-a night that, years from now, when we've made the changes we believe in; when more families can afford to see a doctor; when our children-when Malia and Sasha and your children-inherit a planet that's a little cleaner and safer; when the world sees America differently, and America sees itself as a nation less divided and more united; you'll be able to look back with pride and say that this was the moment when it all began.
Obama	0	This was the moment when the improbable beat what Washington always said was inevitable.
Obama	0	This was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long - when we rallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause; when we finally gave Americans who'd never participated in politics a reason to stand up and to do so.
Obama	0	This was the moment when we finally beat back the politics of fear, and doubt, and cynicism; the politics where we tear each other down instead of lifting this country up.
Obama	0	This was the moment.
Obama	0	Years from now, you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment - this was the place - where America remembered what it means to hope.
Obama	0	For many months, we've been teased, even derided for talking about hope.
Obama	0	But we always knew that hope is not blind optimism.
Obama	0	It's not ignoring the enormity of the task ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path.
Obama	0	It's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight.
Obama	0	Hope is that thing inside us that insists, despite all evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it, and to work for it, and to fight for it.
Obama	0	Hope is what I saw in the eyes of the young woman in Cedar Rapids who works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill; a young woman who still believes that this country will give her the chance to live out her dreams.
Obama	0	Hope is what I heard in the voice of the New Hampshire woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since her nephew left for Iraq; who still goes to bed each night praying for his safe return.
Obama	0	Hope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire; what led the greatest of generations to free a continent and heal a nation; what led young women and young men to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through Selma and Montgomery for freedom's cause.
Obama	0	Hope-hope-is what led me here today - with a father from Kenya; a mother from Kansas; and a story that could only happen in the United States of America.
Obama	0	Hope is the bedrock of this nation; the belief that our destiny will not be written for us, but by us; by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is; who have the courage to remake the world as it should be.
Obama	0	That is what we started here in Iowa, and that is the message we can now carry to New Hampshire and beyond; the same message we had when we were up and when we were down; the one that can change this country brick by brick, block by block, calloused hand by calloused hand - that together, ordinary people can do extraordinary things; because we are not a collection of Red States and Blue States, we are the United States of America; and at this moment, in this election, we are ready to believe again.
Obama	0	Thank you, Iowa.
Obama	0	VIEW ENTIRE SPEECH TURN THE PAGE California Democratic Convention   TOPIC: Election  April 28, 2007 Turn The Page Speech California Democratic National Convention Complete Text INTRODUCTIONS NOT INCLUDED IN TRANSCRIPT  It has now been a little over two months since we began this campaign.
Obama	0	In that time we have traveled all across this country.
Obama	0	And before every event we do, I usually have a minute to sit quietly and collect my thoughts.
Obama	0	And recently, I’ve found myself reflecting on what it was that led me to public service in the first place.
Obama	0	I live in Chicago now, but I am not a native of that great city.
Obama	0	I moved there when I was just a year out of college, and a group of churches offered me a job as a community organizer so I could help rebuild neighborhoods that had been devastated by the closing of steel plants.
Obama	0	The salary was $12,000 a year plus enough money to buy an old, beat-up car, and so I took the job and drove out to Chicago, where I didn’t know a soul.
Obama	0	And during the time I was there, we worked to set up job training programs for the unemployed and after school programs for kids.
Obama	0	And it was the best education I ever had, because I learned in those neighborhoods that when ordinary people come together, they can achieve extraordinary things.
Obama	0	After three years, I went back to law school.
Obama	0	I left there with a degree and a lifetime of debt, but I turned down the corporate job offers so I could come back to Chicago and organize a voter registration drive.
Obama	0	I also started a civil rights practice, and began to teach constitutional law.
Obama	0	And after a few years, people started coming up to me and telling me I should run for state Senate.
Obama	0	So I did what every man does when he’s faced with a big decision – I prayed, and I asked my wife.
Obama	0	And after consulting those two higher powers, I decided to get in the race.
Obama	0	And everywhere I’d go, I’d get two questions.
Obama	0	First, they’d ask, “Where’d you get that funny name, Barack Obama?” Because people just couldn’t pronounce it.
Obama	0	They’d call me “Alabama,” or they’d call me “Yo Mama.” And I’d tell them that my father was from Kenya, and that’s where I got my name.
Obama	0	And my mother was from Kansas, and that’s where I got my accent from.
Obama	0	And the second thing people would ask me was, “You seem like a nice young man.
Obama	0	You’ve done all this great work.
Obama	0	You’ve been a community organizer, and you teach law school, you’re a civil rights attorney, you’re a family man – why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?” And I understand the question, and the cynicism.
Obama	0	We all understand it.
Obama	0	We understand it because we get the sense today that politics has become a business and not a mission.
Obama	0	In the last several years, we have seen Washington become a place where keeping score of who’s up and who’s down is more important than who’s working on behalf of the American people.
Obama	0	We have been told that our mounting debts don’t matter, that the economy is doing great, and so Americans should be left to face their anxiety about rising health care costs and disappearing pensions on their own.
Obama	0	We’ve been told that climate change is a hoax, that our broken schools cannot be fixed, that we are destined to send millions of dollars a day to Mideast dictators for their oil.
Obama	0	And we’ve seen how a foreign policy based on bluster and bombast can lead us into a war that should’ve never been authorized and never been waged.
Obama	0	And when we try to have an honest debate about the crises we face, whether it’s on the Senate floor or a Sunday talk show, the conversation isn’t about finding common ground, it’s about finding someone to blame.
Obama	0	We’re divided into Red States and Blue States, and told to always point the finger at somebody else – the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
Obama	0	For good reason, the rest of us have become cynical about what politics can achieve in this country, and as we’ve turned away in frustration, we know what’s filled the void.
Obama	0	The lobbyists and influence-peddlers with the cash and the connections – the ones who’ve turned government into a game only they can afford to play.
Obama	0	They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we’re here to tell them it’s not for sale.
Obama	0	People tell me I haven’t spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.
Obama	0	But I promise you this – I’ve been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.
Obama	0	I’m running for President because the time for the can’t-do, won’t-do, won’t-even-try style of politics is over.
Obama	0	It’s time to turn the page.
Obama	0	There is an awakening taking place in America today.
Obama	0	From New Hampshire to California, from Texas to Iowa, we are seeing crowds we’ve never seen before; we’re seeing people showing up to the very first political event of their lives.
Obama	0	They’re coming because they know we are at a crossroads right now.
Obama	0	Because we are facing a set of challenges we haven’t seen in a generation – and if we don’t meet those challenges, we could end up leaving our children a world that’s a little poorer and a little meaner than we found it.
Obama	0	And so the American people are hungry for a different kind of politics – the kind of politics based on the ideals this country was founded upon.
Obama	0	The idea that we are all connected as one people.
Obama	0	That we all have a stake in one another.
Obama	0	It’s what I learned as a state Senator in Illinois.
Obama	0	That you can turn the page on old debates; that it’s possible to compromise so long as you as you never compromise your principles; and that so long as we’re willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
Obama	0	That’s how we were able to reform a death penalty system that sent 13 innocent people to death row.
Obama	0	That’s how we were able to give health insurance to 20,000 more children who needed it.
Obama	0	That’s how we gave $100 million worth of tax cuts to working families in Illinois.
Obama	0	And that’s how we passed the first ethics reform in twenty-five years.
Obama	0	We have seen too many campaigns where our problems are talked to death.
Obama	0	Where ten-point plans are crushed under the weight of the same old politics once the election’s over.
Obama	0	Where experience in Washington doesn’t always translate to results for the American people.
Obama	0	And so if we do not change our politics – if we do not fundamentally change the way Washington works – then the problems we’ve been talking about for the last generation will be the same ones that haunt us for generations to come.
Obama	0	We must find a way to come together in this country – to realize that the responsibility we have to one another as Americans is greater than the pursuit of any ideological agenda or corporate bottom line.
Obama	0	Democrats of California, it’s time to turn the page.
Obama	0	It’s time to turn the page on health care – to bring together unions and businesses, Democrats and Republicans, and to let the insurance and drug companies know that while they get a seat at the table, they don’t get to buy every chair.
Obama	0	When I am president, I will sign a universal health care law by the end of my first term.
Obama	0	My plan will cover the uninsured by letting people buy into the same kind of health care plan that members of Congress give themselves.
Obama	0	It will bring down costs by investing in information technology, and preventative care, and by stopping the drug companies from price-gouging when patients need their medicine.
Obama	0	It will help business and families shoulder the burden of catastrophic care so that an illness doesn’t lead to a bankruptcy.
Obama	0	And it will save the average family a thousand dollars a year on their premiums.
Obama	0	We can do this.
Obama	0	It’s time to turn the page on education – to move past the slow decay of indifference that says some schools can’t be fixed and some kids just can’t learn.
Obama	0	As President, I will launch a campaign to recruit and support hundreds of thousands of new teachers across the country, because the most important part of any education is the person standing in the front of the classroom.
Obama	0	It’s time to treat teaching like the profession it is – paying teachers what they deserve and working with them – not against them – to develop the high standards we need.
Obama	0	We can do this.
Obama	0	It’s time to turn the page on energy – to break the political stalemate that’s kept our fuel efficiency standards in the same place for twenty years; to tell the oil and auto industries that they must act, not only because their future’s at stake, but because the future of our country and our planet is at stake as well.
Obama	0	As President, I will institute a cap-and-trade system that would dramatically reduce carbon emissions and auction off emissions credits that would generate millions of dollars to invest in renewable sources of energy.
Obama	0	I’ll put in place a low-carbon fuel standard like you have here in California that will take 32 million cars’ worth of pollution off the road.
Obama	0	And I’d raise the fuel efficiency standards for our cars and trucks because we know we have the technology to do it and it’s time we did.
Obama	0	We can do this.
Obama	0	We can do all of this.
Obama	0	But most of all, we have to turn the page on this disaster in Iraq and restore our standing in the world.
Obama	0	I am proud that I stood up in 2002 and urged our leaders not to take us down this dangerous path.
Obama	0	And so many of you did the same, even when it wasn’t popular to do so.
Obama	0	We knew back then this war was a mistake.
Obama	0	We knew back then that it was dangerous diversion from the struggle against the terrorists who attacked us on September 11th.
Obama	0	We knew back then that we could find ourselves in an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
Obama	0	But the war went forward.
Obama	0	And now, we’ve seen those consequences and we mourn for the dead and wounded.
Obama	0	I was in New Hampshire the other week when a woman told me that her nephew was leaving for Iraq.
Obama	0	And as she started telling me how much she’d miss him and how worried she was about him, she began to cry.
Obama	0	And she said to me, “I can’t breathe.
Obama	0	I want to know, when am I going to be able to breathe again?” It is time to let this woman know she can breathe again.
Obama	0	It is time to put an end this war.
Obama	0	The majority of both houses of the American Congress – Republicans and Democrats – just passed a bill that would do exactly that.
Obama	0	It’s a bill similar to the plan I introduced in January that says there is no military solution to this civil war – that the last, best hope to pressure the warring factions to reach a political settlement is to let the Iraqi government know that America will not be there forever – to begin a phased withdrawal with the goal of bringing all combat brigades home by March 31st, 2008.
Obama	0	We are one signature away from ending this war.
Obama	0	If the President refuses to sign it, we will go back and find the sixteen votes we need to end this war without him.
Obama	0	We will turn up the pressure on all those Republican Congressmen and Senators who refuse to acknowledge the reality that the American people know so well, and we will get this done.
Obama	0	We will bring our troops home.
Obama	0	It’s time to turn the page.
Obama	0	It’s time to show the world that America is still the last, best hope of Earth.
Obama	0	This President may occupy the White House, but for the last six years the position of leader of the free world has remained open.
Obama	0	It’s time to fill that role once more.
Obama	0	Whether it’s terrorism or climate change, global AIDS or the spread of weapons of mass destruction, America cannot meet the threats of this new century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America.
Obama	0	It’s time for us to lead.
Obama	0	It’s time for us to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries.
Obama	0	That we are not a country that runs prisons which lock people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with.
Obama	0	We are not a country which preaches compassion to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major American city.
Obama	0	That is not who we are.
Obama	0	We are America.
Obama	0	We are the nation that liberated a continent from a madman, that lifted ourselves from the depths of Depression, that won Civil Rights, and Women’s Rights, and Voting Rights for all our people.
Obama	0	We are the beacon that has led generations of weary travelers to find opportunity, and liberty, and hope on our doorstep.
Obama	0	That’s who we are.
Obama	0	I was down in Selma, Alabama awhile back, and we were celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
Obama	0	It was a march of ordinary Americans – maids and cooks, preachers and Pullman porters who faced down fire hoses and dogs, tear gas and billy clubs when they tried to get to the other side.
Obama	0	But every time they were stopped, every time they were knocked down, they got back up, they came back, and they kept on marching.
Obama	0	And finally they crossed over.
Obama	0	It was called Bloody Sunday, and it was the culmination of the Civil Rights Movement.
Obama	0	When I came back from that celebration, people would say, oh, what a wonderful celebration of African-American history that must have been.
Obama	0	And I would say, no, that wasn’t African-American history.
Obama	0	That was a celebration of American history – it’s our story.
Obama	0	And it reminds us of a simple truth – a truth I learned all those years ago as an organizer in Chicago – a truth you carry by being here today – that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.
Obama	0	I am confident about my ability to lead this country.
Obama	0	But I also know that I can’t do it without you.
Obama	0	There will be times when I get tired, there will be times when I make a mistake – it’s true, talk to my wife, she’ll tell you.
Obama	0	But this campaign that we’re running has to be about your hopes, and your dreams, and what you will do.
Obama	0	Because there are few obstacles that can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.
Obama	0	That’s how change has always happened – not from the top-down, but from the bottom-up.
Obama	0	And that’s exactly how you and I will change this country.
Obama	0	California, if you want a new kind of politics, it’s time to turn the page.
Obama	0	If you want an end to the old divisions, and the stale debates, and the score-keeping and the name-calling, it’s time to turn the page.
Obama	0	If you want health care for every American and a world-class education for all our children; if you want energy independence and an end to this war in Iraq; if you believe America is still that last, best hope of Earth, then it’s time to turn the page.
Obama	0	It’s time to turn the page for hope.
Obama	0	It’s time to turn the page for justice.
Obama	0	It is time to turn the page and write the next chapter in the great American story.
Obama	0	Let’s begin the work.
Obama	0	Let’s do this together.
Obama	0	Let’s turn that page.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	SPEECH HIGHLIGHT Presidental Annoucement February 10 2007   TOPIC: Our Past, Future & Vision for America  February 10, 2007 Obama Presidential Announcement Springfield, Illinois Complete Text Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today.
Obama	0	We all made this journey for a reason.
Obama	0	It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.
Obama	0	In the face of war, you believe there can be peace.
Obama	0	In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope.
Obama	0	In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
Obama	0	That's the journey we're on today.
Obama	0	But let me tell you how I came to be here.
Obama	0	As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state.
Obama	0	I moved to Illinois over two decades ago.
Obama	0	I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections.
Obama	0	But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year.
Obama	0	And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.
Obama	0	My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods.
Obama	0	I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.
Obama	0	I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
Obama	0	It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.
Obama	0	After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.
Obama	0	I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
Obama	0	It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.
Obama	0	It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
Obama	0	I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today.
Obama	0	It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
Obama	0	That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken.
Obama	0	That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need.
Obama	0	That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.
Obama	0	It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
Obama	0	And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
Obama	0	I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement.
Obama	0	I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.
Obama	0	But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.
Obama	0	The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed.
Obama	0	And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before.
Obama	0	In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees.
Obama	0	In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free.
Obama	0	In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.
Obama	0	We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
Obama	0	Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.
Obama	0	Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
Obama	0	For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it .
Obama	0	That's what Abraham Lincoln understood.
Obama	0	He had his doubts.
Obama	0	He had his defeats.
Obama	0	He had his setbacks.
Obama	0	But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people.
Obama	0	It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free.
Obama	0	It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
Obama	0	All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
Obama	0	We know the challenges.
Obama	0	We've heard them.
Obama	0	We've talked about them for years.
Obama	0	What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.
Obama	0	What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
Obama	0	For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
Obama	0	And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
Obama	0	We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
Obama	0	And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
Obama	0	The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.
Obama	0	They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.
Obama	0	The time for that politics is over.
Obama	0	It's time to turn the page.
Obama	0	We've made some progress already.
Obama	0	I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
Obama	0	But Washington has a long way to go.
Obama	0	And it won't be easy.
Obama	0	That's why we'll have to set priorities.
Obama	0	We'll have to make hard choices.
Obama	0	And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
Obama	0	Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
Obama	0	So let us begin.
Obama	0	Let us begin this hard work together.
Obama	0	Let us transform this nation.
Obama	0	Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age.
Obama	0	Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed.
Obama	0	Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability.
Obama	0	Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.
Obama	0	And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
Obama	0	Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised.
Obama	0	Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement.
Obama	0	And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.
Obama	0	Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America.
Obama	0	Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
Obama	0	Let's do this.
Obama	0	Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis.
Obama	0	We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
Obama	0	Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term.
Obama	0	Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil.
Obama	0	We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
Obama	0	We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases.
Obama	0	We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.
Obama	0	Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here.
Obama	0	Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got.
Obama	0	Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.
Obama	0	I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.
Obama	0	We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities.
Obama	0	But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe.
Obama	0	But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.
Obama	0	Most of you know I opposed this war from the start.
Obama	0	I thought it was a tragic mistake.
Obama	0	Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
Obama	0	America, it's time to start bringing our troops home.
Obama	0	It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
Obama	0	That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008.
Obama	0	Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
Obama	0	Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
Obama	0	Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.
Obama	0	Let us be the generation that begins this work.
Obama	0	I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.
Obama	0	I understand the skepticism.
Obama	0	After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different.
Obama	0	All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
Obama	0	But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
Obama	0	That is why this campaign can't only be about me.
Obama	0	It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together .
Obama	0	This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams.
Obama	0	It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
Obama	0	This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change .
Obama	0	By ourselves, this change will not happen.
Obama	0	Divided, we are bound to fail.
Obama	0	But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.
Obama	0	He tells us that there is power in words.
Obama	0	He tells us that there is power in conviction.
Obama	0	That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people.
Obama	0	He tells us that there is power in hope.
Obama	0	As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
Obama	0	That is our purpose here today.
Obama	0	That's why I'm in this race.
Obama	0	Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation .
Obama	0	I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity.
Obama	0	I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all.
Obama	0	I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
Obama	0	And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
Obama	0	Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
Obama	0	Floor Statement on Bush’s Decision to Increase Troops in Iraq  TOPIC: Iraq January 19, 2007 Floor Statement on Bush’s Decision to Increase Troops in Iraq Complete Text Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on what is a roiling debate not only in the Senate but across the country, and that is the President's policy with respect to Iraq.
Obama	0	There are countless reasons the American people have lost confidence in the President's Iraq policy, but chief among them has been the administration's insistence on making promises and assurances about progress and victory that do not appear to be grounded in the reality of the facts.
Obama	0	We have been told we would be greeted as liberators.
Obama	0	We have been promised the insurgency was in its last throes.
Obama	0	We have been assured again and again that we are making progress and that the Iraqis would soon stand up so we could stand down and our brave sons and daughters could start coming home.
Obama	0	We have been asked to wait, we have been asked to be patient, and we have been asked to give the President and the new Iraqi Government 6 more months, and then 6 more months after that, and then 6 more months after that.
Obama	0	Now, after the loss of more than 3,000 American lives, after spending almost $400 billion, after Iraq has descended into civil war, we have been promised, once again, that the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq will, this time, be well planned, well coordinated, and well supported by the Iraqi Government.
Obama	0	This time, we didn't have to wait to find out that none of this seems to be the case.
Obama	0	Already, American military officials have told the New York Times that there is no clear chain of command between Iraqis and U.S. commanders and no real indication that the Iraqis even want such a partnership.
Obama	0	Yesterday, Prime Minister al-Maliki, the person whom the President said had brought this plan to us, the man who is supposed to be our partner-in-chief for this new plan, told foreign journalists that if the United States would only give his Army better weapons and equipment, our soldiers could go home.
Obama	0	The President's decision to move forward with this escalation anyway, despite all evidence and military advice to the contrary, is the terrible consequence of the decision to give him the broad, open-ended authority to wage this war back in 2002.
Obama	0	Over 4 years later, we can't revisit that decision or reverse some of the tragic outcomes, but what we can do is make sure we provide the kind of oversight and constraints on the President this time that we failed to do the last time.
Obama	0	I cannot in good conscience support this escalation.
Obama	0	It is a policy which has already been tried and a policy which has failed.
Obama	0	Just this morning, I had veterans of the Iraq war visit my office to explain to me that this surge concept is, in fact, no different from what we have repeatedly tried, but with 20,000 troops, we will not in any imaginable way be able to accomplish any new progress.
Obama	0	The fact is that we have tried this road before.
Obama	0	In the end, no amount of American forces can solve the political differences that lie at the heart of somebody else's civil war.
Obama	0	As the President's own military commanders have said, escalation only prevents the Iraqis from taking more responsibility for their own future.
Obama	0	It is even eroding our efforts in the wider war on terror as some of the extra soldiers will come directly from Afghanistan, where the Taliban has become resurgent.
Obama	0	The President has offered no evidence that more U.S. troops will be able to pressure Shias, Sunnis, and Kurds toward the necessary political settlement, and he has attached no consequences to his plan should the Iraqis fail to make progress.
Obama	0	In fact, just last week, when I repeatedly asked Secretary Rice what would happen if the Iraqi Government failed to meet the benchmarks the President has called for and says are an integral part of their rationale for escalation, she couldn't give me an answer.
Obama	0	When I asked her if there were any circumstances whatsoever in which we would tell the Iraqis that their failure to make progress means the end of our military commitment, she could not give me an answer.
Obama	0	This is simply not good enough.
Obama	0	When you ask how many more months and how many more dollars and how many more lives it will take to end the policy that everyone now knows has not succeeded, ``I don't know'' isn't good enough.
Obama	0	Over the past 4 years, we have given this administration every chance to get this right, and they have disappointed us many times.
Obama	0	But ultimately it is our brave men and women in uniform and their families who bear the greatest burden for these mistakes.
Obama	0	They have performed in an exemplary fashion.
Obama	0	At no stage have they faltered in the mission that has been presented to them.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, the strategy, the tactics, and the mission itself have been flawed.
Obama	0	That is why Congress now has the duty to prevent even more mistakes and bring this war to a responsible end.
Obama	0	That is why I plan to introduce legislation which I believe will stop the escalation of this war by placing a cap on the number of soldiers in Iraq.
Obama	0	I wish to emphasize that I am not unique in taking this approach.
Obama	0	I know Senator Dodd has crafted similar legislation.
Obama	0	Senator Clinton, I believe, yesterday indicated she shared similar views.
Obama	0	The cap would not affect the money spent on the war or on our troops, but it would write into law that the number of U.S. forces in Iraq should not exceed the number that were there on January 10, 2007, the day the President announced his escalation policy.
Obama	0	This measure would stop the escalation of the war in Iraq, but it is my belief that simply opposing the surge is not good enough.
Obama	0	If we truly believe the only solution in Iraq is a political one--and I fervently believe that--if we believe a phased redeployment of U.S. forces in Iraq is the best--perhaps only--leverage we have to force a settlement between the country's warring factions, then we should act on that.
Obama	0	That is why the second part of my legislation is a plan for phased redeployment that I called for in a speech in Chicago 2 months ago.
Obama	0	It is a responsible plan that protects American troops without causing Iraq to suddenly descend into chaos.
Obama	0	The President must announce to the Iraqi people that within 2 to 4 months, under this plan, U.S. policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.
Obama	0	The President should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates.
Obama	0	Drawing down our troops in Iraq will put pressure on Iraqis to arrive at the political settlement that is needed and allow us to redeploy additional troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region, as well as bring some back home.
Obama	0	The forces redeployed elsewhere in the region could then help to prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, something that every international observer is beginning to worry about.
Obama	0	It will also reassure our allies in the Gulf.
Obama	0	It will allow our troops to strike directly at al-Qaida wherever it may exist and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
Obama	0	My plan would couple this phased redeployment with an enhanced effort to train Iraqi security forces and would expand the number of our personnel--especially special forces--who are deployed with Iraqis as unit advisers and would finally link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward reducing sectarian violence and reaching a political settlement.
Obama	0	One final aspect of this plan that I believe is critical is it would call for engagement by the United States in a regional conference with other countries that are involved in the Middle East--particularly our allies, but including Syria and Iran--to find a solution to the war in Iraq.
Obama	0	We have to realize that neither Iran nor Syria wants to see the security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region and within their own countries.
Obama	0	So as odious as the behavior of those regimes may be at times, it is important that we include them in a broader conversation about how we can stabilize Iraq.
Obama	0	In closing, let me say this: I have been a consistent and strong opponent of this war.
Obama	0	I have also tried to act responsibly in that opposition to ensure that, having made the decision to go into Iraq, we provide our troops, who perform valiantly, the support they need to complete their mission.
Obama	0	I have also stated publicly that I think we have both strategic interests and humanitarian responsibilities in ensuring that Iraq is as stable as possible under the circumstances.
Obama	0	Finally, I said publicly that it is my preference not to micromanage the Commander-in-Chief in the prosecution of war.
Obama	0	Ultimately, I do not believe that is the ideal role for Congress to play.
Obama	0	But at a certain point, we have to draw a line.
Obama	0	At a certain point, the American people have to have some confidence that we are not simply going down this blind alley in perpetuity.
Obama	0	When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and assurances, for waiting and patience is over.
Obama	0	Too many lives have been lost and too many billions have been spent for us to trust the President on another tried-and-failed policy, opposed by generals and experts, opposed by Democrats and Republicans, opposed by Americans and even the Iraqis themselves.
Obama	0	It is time to change our policy.
Obama	0	It is time to give Iraqis their country back, and it is time to refocus America's effort on the wider struggle against terror yet to be won.
Obama	0	Time Has Come for Universal Health Care  TOPIC: Healthcare & Health Issues January 25, 2007 The Time Has Come for Universal Health Care Families USA Conference, Washington, DC Complete Text Thank you Ron Pollack and thank you Families USA for inviting me to speak here this morning.
Obama	0	On this January morning of two thousand and seven, more than sixty years after President Truman first issued the call for national health insurance, we find ourselves in the midst of an historic moment on health care.
Obama	0	From Maine to California, from business to labor, from Democrats to Republicans, the emergence of new and bold proposals from across the spectrum has effectively ended the debate over whether or not we should have universal health care in this country.
Obama	0	Plans that tinker and halfway measures now belong to yesterday.
Obama	0	The President's latest proposal that does little to bring down cost or guarantee coverage falls into this category.
Obama	0	There will be many others offered in the coming campaign, and I am working with experts to develop my own plan as we speak, but let's make one thing clear right here, right now: In the 2008 campaign, affordable, universal health care for every single American must not be a question of whether, it must be a question of how.
Obama	0	We have the ideas, we have the resources, and we must find the will to pass a plan by the end of the next president's first term.
Obama	0	I know there's a cynicism out there about whether this can happen, and there's reason for it.
Obama	0	Every four years, health care plans are offered up in campaigns with great fanfare and promise.
Obama	0	But once those campaigns end, the plans collapse under the weight of Washington politics, leaving the rest of America to struggle with skyrocketing costs.
Obama	0	For too long, this debate has been stunted by what I call the smallness of our politics - the idea that there isn't much we can agree on or do about the major challenges facing our country.
Obama	0	And when some try to propose something bold, the interests groups and the partisans treat it like a sporting event, with each side keeping score of who's up and who's down, using fear and divisiveness and other cheap tricks to win their argument, even if we lose our solution in the process.
Obama	0	Well we can't afford another disappointing charade in 2008.
Obama	0	It's not only tiresome, it's wrong.
Obama	0	Wrong when businesses have to layoff one employee because they can't afford the health care of another.
Obama	0	Wrong when a parent cannot take a sick child to the doctor because they cannot afford the bill that comes with it.
Obama	0	Wrong when 46 million Americans have no health care at all.
Obama	0	In a country that spends more on health care than any other nation on Earth, it's just wrong.
Obama	0	And yet, in recent years, what's caught the attention of those who haven't always been in favor of reform is the realization that this crisis isn't just morally offensive, it's economically untenable.
Obama	0	For years, the can't-do crowd has scared the American people into believing that universal health care would mean socialized medicine and burdensome taxes - that we should just stay out of the way and tinker at the margins.
Obama	0	You know the statistics.
Obama	0	Family premiums are up by nearly 87% over the last five years, growing five times faster than workers' wages.
Obama	0	Deductibles are up 50%.
Obama	0	Co-payments for care and prescriptions are through the roof.
Obama	0	Nearly 11 million Americans who are already insured spent more than a quarter of their salary on health care last year.
Obama	0	And over half of all family bankruptcies today are caused by medical bills.
Obama	0	But they say it's too costly to act.
Obama	0	Almost half of all small businesses no longer offer health care to their workers, and so many others have responded to rising costs by laying off workers or shutting their doors for good.
Obama	0	Some of the biggest corporations in America, giants of industry like GM and Ford, are watching foreign competitors based in countries with universal health care run circles around them, with a GM car containing twice as much health care cost as a Japanese car.
Obama	0	But they say it's too risky to act.
Obama	0	They tell us it's too expensive to cover the uninsured, but they don't mention that every time an American without health insurance walks into an emergency room, we pay even more.
Obama	0	Our family's premiums are $922 higher because of the cost of care for the uninsured.
Obama	0	We pay $15 billion more in taxes because of the cost of care for the uninsured.
Obama	0	And it's trapped us in a vicious cycle.
Obama	0	As the uninsured cause premiums to rise, more employers drop coverage.
Obama	0	As more employers drop coverage, more people become uninsured, and premiums rise even further.
Obama	0	But the skeptics tell us that reform is too costly, too risky, too impossible for America.
Obama	0	Well the skeptics must be living somewhere else.
Obama	0	Because when you see what the health care crisis is doing to our families, to our economy, to our country, you realize that caution is what's costly.
Obama	0	Inaction is what's risky.
Obama	0	Doing nothing is what's impossible when it comes to health care in America.
Obama	0	It's time to act.
Obama	0	This isn't a problem of money, this is a problem of will.
Obama	0	A failure of leadership.
Obama	0	We already spend $2.2 trillion a year on health care in this country.
Obama	0	My colleague, Senator Ron Wyden, who's recently developed a bold new health care plan of his own, tells it this way: For the money Americans spent on health care last year, we could have hired a group of skilled physicians, paid each one of them $200,000 to care for just seven families, and guaranteed every single American quality, affordable health care.
Obama	0	So where's all that money going?
Obama	0	We know that a quarter of it - one out of every four health care dollars - is spent on non-medical costs; mostly bills and paperwork.
Obama	0	And we also know that this is completely unnecessary.
Obama	0	Almost every other industry in the world has saved billions on these administrative costs by doing it all online.
Obama	0	Every transaction you make at a bank now costs them less than a penny.
Obama	0	Even at the Veterans Administration, where it used to cost nine dollars to pull up your medical record, new technology means you can call up the same record on the internet for next to nothing.
Obama	0	But because we haven't updated technology in the rest of the health care industry, a single transaction still costs up to twenty-five dollars - not one dime of which goes toward improving the quality of our health care.
Obama	0	This is simply inexcusable, and if we brought our entire health care system online, something everyone from Ted Kennedy to Newt Gingrich believes we should do, we'd already be saving over $600 million a year on health care costs.
Obama	0	The federal government should be leading the way here.
Obama	0	If you do business with the federal employee health benefits program, you should move to an electronic claims system.
Obama	0	If you are a provider who works with Medicare, you should have to report your patient's health outcomes, so that we can figure out, on a national level, how to improve health care quality.
Obama	0	These are all things experts tell us must be done but aren't being done.
Obama	0	And the federal government should lead.
Obama	0	Another, more controversial area we need to look at is how much of our health care spending is going toward the record-breaking profits earned by the drug and health care industry.
Obama	0	It's perfectly understandable for a corporation to try and make a profit, but when those profits are soaring higher and higher each year while millions lose their coverage and premiums skyrocket, we have a responsibility to ask why.
Obama	0	At a time when businesses are facing increased competition and workers rarely stay with one company throughout their lives, we also have to ask if the employer-based system of health care itself is still the best for providing insurance to all Americans.
Obama	0	We have to ask what we can do to provide more Americans with preventative care, which would mean fewer doctor's visits and less cost down the road.
Obama	0	We should make sure that every single child who's eligible is signed up for the children's health insurance program, and the federal government should make sure that our states have the money to make that happen.
Obama	0	And we have to start looking at some of the interesting ideas on comprehensive reform that are coming out of states like Maine and Illinois and California, to see what we can replicate on a national scale and what will move us toward that goal of universal coverage for all.
Obama	0	But regardless of what combination of policies and proposals get us to this goal, we must reach it.
Obama	0	We must act.
Obama	0	And we must act boldly.
Obama	0	As one health care advocate recently said, "The most expensive course is to do nothing."
Obama	0	But it wasn't a liberal Democrat or union leader who said this.
Obama	0	It was the president of the very health industry association that funded the "Harry and Louise" ads designed to kill the Clinton health care plan in the early nineties.
Obama	0	The debate in this country over health care has shifted.
Obama	0	The support for comprehensive reform that organizations like Families USA have worked so hard to build is now widespread, and the diverse group of business and health industry interests that are part of your Health Care Coverage Coalition is a testament to that success.
Obama	0	And so Washington no longer has an excuse for caution.
Obama	0	Leaders no longer have a reason to be timid.
Obama	0	And America can no longer afford inaction.
Obama	0	That's not who we are - and that's not the story of our nation's improbable progress.
Obama	0	Half a century ago, America found itself in the midst of another health care crisis.
Obama	0	For millions of elderly Americans, the single greatest cause of poverty and hardship was the crippling cost of health care and the lack of affordable insurance.
Obama	0	Two out of every three elderly Americans had annual incomes of less than $1,000, and only one in eight had health insurance.
Obama	0	As health care and hospital costs continued to rise, more and more private insurers simply refused to insure our elderly, believing they were too great of a risk to care for.
Obama	0	The resistance to action was fierce.
Obama	0	Proponents of health care reform were opposed by well-financed, well-connected interest groups who spared no expense in telling the American people that these efforts were "dangerous" and "un-American," "revolutionary" and even "deadly."
Obama	0	And yet the reformers marched on.
Obama	0	They testified before Congress and they took their case to the country and they introduced dozens of different proposals but always, always they stood firm on their goal to provide health care for every American senior.
Obama	0	And finally, after years of advocacy and negotiation and plenty of setbacks, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Medicare bill into law on July 30th of 1965.
Obama	0	The signing ceremony was held in Missouri, in a town called Independence, with the first man who was bold enough to issue the call for universal health care - President Harry Truman.
Obama	0	And as he stood with Truman by his side and signed what would become the most successful government program in history - a program that had seemed impossible for so long - President Johnson looked out at the crowd and said, "History shapes men, but it is a necessary faith of leadership that men can help shape history."
Obama	0	Never forget that we have it within our power to shape history in this country.
Obama	0	It is not in our character to sit idly by as victims of fate or circumstance, for we are a people of action and innovation, forever pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
Obama	0	Now is the time to push those boundaries once more.
Obama	0	We have come so far in the debate on health care in this country, but now we must finally answer the call first issued by Truman, advanced by Johnson, and fought for by so many leaders and Americans throughout the last century.
Obama	0	The time has come for universal health care in America.
Obama	0	And I look forward to working with all of you to meet this challenge in the weeks and months to come.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	098-Floor-Statement-on-Iraq-War-Deescalation-Act-of-2007-Obama-Speech.htm Floor Statement on Iraq War De-escalation Act of 2007- Complete Text TOPIC: Iraq  Tuesday, January 30, 2007 Floor Statement on Iraq War De-escalation Act of 2007 Complete Text  Mr. President, today in Iraq, we sadly find ourselves at the very point I feared most when I opposed giving the President the open-ended authority to wage this war in 2002 - an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences in the midst of a country torn by civil war.
Obama	0	The American people have waited and the American people have been patient.
Obama	0	We have given chance after chance for a resolution that has not come, and, more importantly, watched with horror and grief the tragic loss of thousands of brave young American soldiers.
Obama	0	The time for waiting in Iraq is over.
Obama	0	The days of our open-ended commitment must come to a close.
Obama	0	And the need to bring this war to an end is here.
Obama	0	That is why today, I'm introducing the Iraq War De-escalation Act of 2007.
Obama	0	This plan would not only place a cap on the number of troops in Iraq and stop the escalation, more importantly, it would begin a phased redeployment of U.S. forces with the goal of removing of all U.S. combat forces from Iraq by March 31st, 2008 - consistent with the expectations of the bipartisan Iraq study group that the President has so assiduously ignored.
Obama	0	The redeployment of troops to the United States, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in the region would begin no later than May 1st of this year, toward the end of the timeframe I first proposed in a speech more than two months ago.
Obama	0	In a civil war where no military solution exists, this redeployment remains our best leverage to pressure the Iraqi government to achieve the political settlement between its warring factions that can slow the bloodshed and promote stability.
Obama	0	My plan allows for a limited number of U.S. troops to remain as basic force protection, to engage in counter-terrorism, and to continue the training of Iraqi security forces.
Obama	0	And if the Iraqis are successful in meeting the thirteen benchmarks for progress laid out by the Bush Administration itself, this plan also allows for the temporary suspension of the redeployment, provided Congress agrees that the benchmarks have actually been met and that the suspension is in the national security interest of the United States.
Obama	0	The U.S. military has performed valiantly and brilliantly in Iraq.
Obama	0	Our troops have done all that we have asked them to do and more.
Obama	0	But no amount of American soldiers can solve the political differences at the heart of somebody else's civil war, nor settle the grievances in the hearts of the combatants.
Obama	0	It is my firm belief that the responsible course of action - for the United States, for Iraq, and for our troops - is to oppose this reckless escalation and to pursue a new policy.
Obama	0	This policy that I've laid out is consistent with what I have advocated for well over a year, with many of the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and with what the American people demanded in the November election.
Obama	0	When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and assurances, for waiting and patience, is over.
Obama	0	Too many lives have been lost and too many billions have been spent for us to trust the President on another tried and failed policy opposed by generals and experts, Democrats and Republicans, Americans and many of the Iraqis themselves.
Obama	0	It is time for us to fundamentally change our policy.
Obama	0	It is time to give Iraqis their country back.
Obama	0	And it is time to refocus America's efforts on the challenges we face at home and the wider struggle against terror yet to be won.
Obama	0	World AIDS Day Speech - 2006 Global Summit on AIDS  TOPIC: Healthcare & Health Issues December 1, 2006 Race Against Time 2006 Global Summit on AIDS and the Church Saddleback Church Campus Complete Text I want to start by saying how blessed I feel to be a part of today and how grateful I am for your church and your pastor, my friend Rick Warren.
Obama	0	Ever since Rick and Kay visited Africa to see the pain and suffering wrought by AIDS, the Warrens and this church have proved each day that faith is not just something you have, it's something you do.
Obama	0	Their decision to devote their time, their money, and their purpose-driven lives to the greatest health crisis in human history is not one that's always reported on the news or splashed across the front pages, but it is quietly becoming one of the most influential forces in the struggle against HIV and AIDS.
Obama	0	The resources of governments may be vast, and the good works of philanthropists may be abundant, but we should never underestimate how powerful the passion of people of faith can be in eradicating this disease.
Obama	0	One of those passionate individuals is the man we just heard from - my friend and colleague, Sam Brownback.
Obama	0	Now, Sam and I may not agree on every issue, but I could not be more impressed with his efforts on issues like AIDS, the crisis in the Congo, the genocide in Darfur and sexual trafficking - issues that touch some of the world's most vulnerable people.
Obama	0	I am proud to work with him on many of these issues, and I'm proud to be by his side today.
Obama	0	I took my own trip to Africa a few months ago.
Obama	0	As I'm sure Rick and Kay would agree, it's an experience that stays with you for quite some time.
Obama	0	I visited an HIV/AIDS hospital in South Africa that was filled to capacity with people who walked hours - even days - just for the chance to seek help.
Obama	0	I met courageous patients who refused to give up for themselves or their families.
Obama	0	And I came across AIDS activists who meet resistance from their own government but keep on fighting anyway.
Obama	0	But of all that I heard, I encountered few stories as heartbreaking as the one recently told by Laurie Goering, a Chicago Tribune reporter based in Johannesburg who had covered our trip for her newspaper.
Obama	0	Three years ago, Laurie hired a woman named Hlengiwe Leocardia Mchunu as her nanny.
Obama	0	Leo, as she is known, grew up as one of nine children in a small South African village.
Obama	0	All through her life, she worked hard to raise her two kids and save every last penny she earned, and by the time Leo was hired as Laurie's nanny, she had almost finished paying off the mortgage on her home.
Obama	0	She had even hoped to use the extra money from her new job to open a refuge for local children who had been orphaned by AIDS.
Obama	0	Then one day, Leo received a phone call that her eldest brother had fallen ill. At first he told everyone it was diabetes, but later, in the hospital, admitted to the family it was AIDS.
Obama	0	He died a few days later.
Obama	0	His wife succumbed to the disease as well.
Obama	0	And Leo took in their three children.
Obama	0	Six months later, Leo got another phone call.
Obama	0	Her younger brother had also become sick with AIDS.
Obama	0	She cared for him and nursed him as she did her first brother, but he soon died as well.
Obama	0	Leo's pregnant sister was next.
Obama	0	And then another brother.
Obama	0	And then another brother.
Obama	0	She paid for their caskets and their funerals.
Obama	0	She took in their children and paid for their schooling.
Obama	0	She ran out of money, and she borrowed what she could.
Obama	0	She ran out again, and she borrowed even more.
Obama	0	And still, the phone calls continued.
Obama	0	All across her tiny village, Leo watched more siblings and cousins and nieces and nephews test positive for HIV.
Obama	0	She saw neighbors lose their families.
Obama	0	She saw a grandmother house sixteen orphaned grandchildren under her roof.
Obama	0	And she saw some children go hungry because there was no one to care for them at all.
Obama	0	You know, AIDS is a story often told by numbers.
Obama	0	40 million infected with HIV.
Obama	0	Nearly 4.5 million this year alone.
Obama	0	12 million orphans in Africa.
Obama	0	8,000 deaths and 6,000 new infections every single day.
Obama	0	In some places, 90% of those with HIV do not know they have it.
Obama	0	And we just learned that AIDS is set to become the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide in the coming years.
Obama	0	They are staggering, these numbers, and they help us understand the magnitude of this pandemic.
Obama	0	But when repeated by themselves, statistics can also numb - they can hide the individual stories and tragedies and hopes of the Leos who live the daily drama of this disease.
Obama	0	On this World AIDS day, these are the stories that the world needs to hear.
Obama	0	They are the stories that touch our souls - and that call us to action.
Obama	0	I cannot begin to imagine what it would be like if Leo's family was my own.
Obama	0	If I had to answer those phone calls - if I had to attend those funerals.
Obama	0	All I know is that no matter how or why my family became sick, I would be called to care for them and comfort them and do what I could to help find a cure.
Obama	0	I know every one of you would do the same if it were your family.
Obama	0	Here's the thing - my faith tells me that Leo's family is my family.
Obama	0	We are all sick because of AIDS - and we are all tested by this crisis.
Obama	0	It is a test not only of our willingness to respond, but of our ability to look past the artificial divisions and debates that have often shaped that response.
Obama	0	When you go to places like Africa and you see this problem up close, you realize that it's not a question of either treatment or prevention - or even what kind of prevention - it is all of the above.
Obama	0	It is not an issue of either science or values - it is both.
Obama	0	Yes, there must be more money spent on this disease.
Obama	0	But there must also be a change in hearts and minds; in cultures and attitudes.
Obama	0	Neither philanthropist nor scientist; neither government nor church, can solve this problem on their own - AIDS must be an all-hands-on-deck effort.
Obama	0	Let's talk about what these efforts involve.
Obama	0	First, if we hope to win this fight, we must stop new infections - we must do what we can to prevent people from contracting HIV in the first place.
Obama	0	Now, too often, the issue of prevention has been framed in either/or terms.
Obama	0	For some, the only way to prevent the disease is for men and women to change their sexual behavior - in particular, to abstain from sexual activity outside of marriage.
Obama	0	For others, such a prescription is unrealistic; they argue that we need to provide people with the tools they need to protect themselves from the virus, regardless of their sexual practices - in particular, by increasing the use of condoms, as well as by developing new methods, like microbicides, that women can initiate themselves to prevent transmission during sex.
Obama	0	And in the debate surrounding how we should tackle the scourge of AIDS, we often see each side questioning the other's motives, and thereby impeding progress.
Obama	0	For me, this is a false argument.
Obama	0	Let me say this - I don't think we can deny that there is a moral and spiritual component to prevention - that in too many places all over the world where AIDS is prevalent - including our own country, by the way - the relationship between men and women, between sexuality and spirituality, has broken down, and needs to be repaired.
Obama	0	It was striking to see this as I traveled through South Africa and Kenya.
Obama	0	Again and again, I heard stories of men and women contracting HIV because sex was no longer part of a sacred covenant, but a mechanical physical act; because men had visited prostitutes and brought the disease home to their wives, or young girls had been subjected to rape and abuse.
Obama	0	These are issues of prevention we cannot walk away from.
Obama	0	When a husband thinks it's acceptable to hide his infidelity from his wife, it's not only a sin, it's a potential death sentence.
Obama	0	And when rape is still seen as a woman's fault and a woman's shame, but promiscuity is a man's prerogative, it is a problem of the heart that no government can solve.
Obama	0	It is, however, a place where local ministries and churches like Saddleback can, and have, made a real difference - by providing people with a moral framework to make better choices.
Obama	0	Having said that, I also believe that we cannot ignore that abstinence and fidelity may too often be the ideal and not the reality - that we are dealing with flesh and blood men and women and not abstractions - and that if condoms and potentially microbicides can prevent millions of deaths, they should be made more widely available.
Obama	0	I know that there are those who, out of sincere religious conviction, oppose such measures.
Obama	0	And with these folks, I must respectfully but unequivocally disagree.
Obama	0	I do not accept the notion that those who make mistakes in their lives should be given an effective death sentence.
Obama	0	Nor am I willing to stand by and allow those who are entirely innocent - wives who, because of the culture they live in, often have no power to refuse sex with their husbands, or children who are born with the infection as a consequence of their parent's behavior -suffer when condoms or other measures would have kept them from harm.
Obama	0	Another area where we can make significant progress in prevention is by removing the stigma that goes along with getting tested for HIV-AIDS.
Obama	0	The idea that in some places, nine in ten people with HIV have no idea they're infected is more than frightening - it's a ticking time bomb waiting to go off.
Obama	0	So we need to show people that just as there is no shame in going to the doctor for a blood test or a CAT scan or a mammogram, there is no shame in going for an HIV test.
Obama	0	Because while there was once a time when a positive result gave little hope, today the earlier you know, the faster you can get help.
Obama	0	My wife Michelle and I were able to take the test on our trip to Africa, after the Center for Disease Control informed us that by getting a simple 15 minute test, we may have encouraged as many as half-a-million Kenyans to get tested as well.
Obama	0	Rick Warren has also taken the test.
Obama	0	Sam Brownback and I took it today.
Obama	0	And I encourage others in public life to do the same.
Obama	0	We've got to spread the word to as many people as possible.
Obama	0	It's time for us to set an example for others to follow.
Obama	0	Of course, even as we work diligently to slow the rate of new infection, we also have a responsibility to treat the 40 million people who are already living with HIV.
Obama	0	In some ways, this should be the easy part.
Obama	0	Because we know what works.
Obama	0	We know how to save people's lives.
Obama	0	We know the medicine is out there and we know that wealthy countries can afford to do more.
Obama	0	That's why it was so frustrating for me to go to South Africa, and see the pain, and see the suffering, and then hear that the country's Minister of Health had promoted the use of beet root, sweet potato, and lemon juice as the best way to cure HIV.
Obama	0	Thankfully, the South African government eventually repudiated this, but it's impossible to overestimate how important it is for political leaders like this to set a good example for their people.
Obama	0	We should never forget that God granted us the power to reason so that we would do His work here on Earth - so that we would use science to cure disease, and heal the sick, and save lives.
Obama	0	And one of the miracles to come out of the AIDS pandemic is that scientists have discovered medicine that can give people with HIV a new chance at life.
Obama	0	We are called to give them that chance.
Obama	0	We have made progress - in South Africa, treatment provided to pregnant women has drastically reduced the incidents of infants born with the infection.
Obama	0	But despite such progress, only one in every five people with HIV around the world is receiving antiretroviral drug treatment.
Obama	0	One in every five.
Obama	0	We must do better.
Obama	0	We should work with drug companies to reduce the costs of generic anti-retroviral drugs, and work with developing nations to help them build the health infrastructure that's necessary to get sick people treated - this means more money for hospitals and medical equipment, and more training for nurses and doctors.
Obama	0	We need a renewed emphasis on nutrition.
Obama	0	Right now we're finding out that there are people who are on the drugs, who are getting treatment, who are still dying because they don't have any food to eat.
Obama	0	This is inexcusable - especially in countries that have sufficient food supplies.
Obama	0	So we must help get them that nutrition, and this is another place where religious organizations that have always provided food to the hungry can help a great deal.
Obama	0	And even as we focus on the enormous crisis in Africa, we need to remember that the problem is not in Africa alone.
Obama	0	In the last few years, we have seen an alarming rise in infection rates in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean.
Obama	0	And on this World AIDS day, we cannot forget the crisis occurring in our own backyard.
Obama	0	Right here in the United States, AIDS is now the leading cause of death for African American women aged 25-34, and we are also seeing many poorer and rural communities fail to get the resources they need to deal with their vulnerable populations - a problem that unfortunately some in Congress are trying to address by taking money away from larger cities that are still facing enormous problems of their own.
Obama	0	Now let me say this - I think that President Bush and this past Congress should be applauded for the resources they have contributed to the fight against HIV and AIDS.
Obama	0	Through our country's emergency plan for AIDS relief, the United States will have contributed more than $15 billion over five years to combat HIV-AIDS overseas.
Obama	0	And the Global Fund, with money from the United States and other countries, has done some heroic work to fight this disease.
Obama	0	As I traveled throughout Africa this summer, I was proud of the tangible impact that all this money was having, often through coordinated efforts with the Centers for Disease Control, the State Department, foreign governments, and non-governmental organizations.
Obama	0	So our first priority in Congress should be to reauthorize this program when it expires in 2008.
Obama	0	Our second priority should be to reassess what's worked and what hasn't so that we're not wasting one dollar that could be saving someone's life.
Obama	0	But our third priority should be to actually boost our contribution to this effort.
Obama	0	With all that is left to be done in this struggle - with all the other areas of the world that need our help - it's time for us to add at least an additional $1 billion a year in new money over the next five years to strengthen and expand the program to places like Southeast Asia, India, and Eastern Europe, where the pandemic will soon reach crisis proportions.
Obama	0	Of course, given all the strains that have been placed on the U.S. budget, and given the extraordinary needs that we face here at home, it may be hard to find the money.
Obama	0	But I believe we must try.
Obama	0	I believe it will prove to be a wise investment.
Obama	0	The list of reasons for us to care about AIDS is long.
Obama	0	In an interconnected, globalized world, the ability of pandemics to spread to other countries and continents has never been easier or faster than it is today.
Obama	0	There are also security implications, as countries whose populations and economies have been ravaged by AIDS become fertile breeding grounds for civil strife and even terror.
Obama	0	But the reason for us to step up our efforts can't simply be instrumental.
Obama	0	There are more fundamental reasons to care.
Obama	0	Reasons related to our own humanity.
Obama	0	Reasons of the soul.
Obama	0	Like no other illness, AIDS tests our ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes - to empathize with the plight of our fellow man.
Obama	0	While most would agree that the AIDS orphan or the transfusion victim or the wronged wife contracted the disease through no fault of their own, it has too often been easy for some to point to the unfaithful husband or the promiscuous youth or the gay man and say "This is your fault.
Obama	0	You have sinned."
Obama	0	I don't think that's a satisfactory response.
Obama	0	My faith reminds me that we all are sinners.
Obama	0	My faith also tells me that - as Pastor Rick has said - it is not a sin to be sick.
Obama	0	My Bible tells me that when God sent his only Son to Earth, it was to heal the sick and comfort the weary; to feed the hungry and clothe the naked; to befriend the outcast and redeem those who strayed from righteousness.
Obama	0	Living His example is the hardest kind of faith - but it is surely the most rewarding.
Obama	0	It is a way of life that can not only light our way as people of faith, but guide us to a new and better politics as Americans.
Obama	0	For in the end, we must realize that the AIDS orphan in Africa presents us with the same challenge as the gang member in South Central, or the Katrina victim in New Orleans, or the uninsured mother in North Dakota.
Obama	0	We can turn away from these Americans, and blame their problems on themselves, and embrace a politics that's punitive and petty, divisive and small.
Obama	0	Or we can embrace another tradition of politics - a tradition that has stretched from the days of our founding to the glory of the civil rights movement, a tradition based on the simple idea that we have a stake in one another - and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart, and that if enough people believe in the truth of that proposition and act on it, then we might not solve every problem, but we can get something meaningful done for the people with whom we share this Earth.
Obama	0	Let me close by returning to the story of Leo, that South African woman burdened by so much death and despair.
Obama	0	Sometime after the death of her fifth sibling, she decided that she wasn't just going to stand idly by.
Obama	0	She decided to call the town's first public meeting about the AIDS crisis - something that no one had even talked about, let alone met about.
Obama	0	200 people showed up.
Obama	0	Some had walked for miles to get there, a few with their grandchildren on their back.
Obama	0	One by one, they stood up and broke their silence, and they told their stories.
Obama	0	Stories of tragedy, and stories of hope.
Obama	0	And when they were done, Leo rose and said, "I don't know whether we will win this war, but I'm looking for people who will stand up and face the reality.
Obama	0	The time for sitting silently has come to an end."
Obama	0	Everything did not suddenly get better after that meeting, but some things did.
Obama	0	Despite all the children she had to raise and all the sick relatives she still had to care for, Leo still decided to open the AIDS orphanage she had dreamed about so long ago.
Obama	0	She began building a daycare center that would house one hundred orphans.
Obama	0	And she started plans on a youth center and a soup kitchen.
Obama	0	I hear that part of the story and I think, if this woman who has so little, and has lost so much, can do so much good - if she can still make a way out of no way - then what are we waiting for?
Obama	0	Corinthians says that we are all of one spirit, and that "if one part suffers, every part suffers with it."
Obama	0	But it also says, "if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it."
Obama	0	On this World AIDS day, it is the stories of overcoming, and not just illness, that the world needs to hear.
Obama	0	Yes, the stories of sadness call us to suffer with the sick.
Obama	0	But stories like Leo's also call us to honor her example, rejoice in the hope that it brings, and work to help her find that brighter future.
Obama	0	Thank you, and God Bless you.
Obama	0	Way Forward in Iraq Remarks - Chicago Council on Global Affairs  TOPIC: Iraq November 20, 2006 A Way Forward in Iraq Remarks Chicago Council on Global Affairs Complete Text Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
Obama	0	They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment ?
Obama	0	making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.
Obama	0	This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord.
Obama	0	It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg.
Obama	0	It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism.
Obama	0	And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
Obama	0	diplomatic, economic, and military ?
Obama	0	to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it.
Obama	0	In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?
Obama	0	a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.
Obama	0	A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.
Obama	0	Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
Obama	0	Neither turned out to be true.
Obama	0	And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
Obama	0	That policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country.
Obama	0	“Mission Accomplished,” “cut and run,” “stay the course” ?
Obama	0	the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
Obama	0	a conflict that has only increased the terrorist threat it was supposed to help contain.
Obama	0	2,867 Americans have now died in this war.
Obama	0	Thousands more have suffered wounds that will last a lifetime.
Obama	0	Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.
Obama	0	The conflict has left us distracted from containing the world’s growing threats ?
Obama	0	in North Korea, in Iran, and in Afghanistan.
Obama	0	And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.
Obama	0	These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?
Obama	0	a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region.
Obama	0	This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.
Obama	0	The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
Obama	0	I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
Obama	0	Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.
Obama	0	No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions.
Obama	0	We have been assured that the insurgency is in its last throes.
Obama	0	We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down.
Obama	0	Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in Iraq.
Obama	0	When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.
Obama	0	At that point, seventy-five U.S.
Obama	0	Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in Iraq.
Obama	0	What we have seen instead is a year of significant deterioration.
Obama	0	A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
Obama	0	A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
Obama	0	According to our own Pentagon, the situation on the ground is now pointing towards chaos.
Obama	0	Sectarian violence has reached an all-time high, and 365,000 Iraqis have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February.
Obama	0	300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
Obama	0	The addition of 4,000 American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.
Obama	0	And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on American soldiers.
Obama	0	Prime Minister Maliki is not making our job easier.
Obama	0	In just the past three weeks, he has ?
Obama	0	and I’m quoting from a New York Times article here ?
Obama	0	“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.” This is now the reality of Iraq.
Obama	0	Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
Obama	0	I am committed to working with this White House and any of my colleagues in the months to come to craft such a consensus.
Obama	0	And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.
Obama	0	But it will not be easy.
Obama	0	For the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.
Obama	0	There are no options that do not carry significant risks.
Obama	0	And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq.
Obama	0	Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
Obama	0	What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
Obama	0	It is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them.
Obama	0	And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve.
Obama	0	The American people have been extraordinarily resolved.
Obama	0	They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.
Obama	0	They have spent hundreds of billions of their hard-earned dollars on this effort ?
Obama	0	money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
Obama	0	No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ?
Obama	0	and that strategy must change.
Obama	0	It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.
Obama	0	Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ?
Obama	0	dreams and hopes.
Obama	0	We must instead turn our focus to those concrete objectives that are possible to attain ?
Obama	0	namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
Obama	0	There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq.
Obama	0	And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
Obama	0	It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
Obama	0	Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.
Obama	0	Let me underscore this point.
Obama	0	The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
Obama	0	They are doing so today.
Obama	0	They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in Iraq.
Obama	0	But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
Obama	0	Our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.
Obama	0	And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
Obama	0	I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one.
Obama	0	To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
Obama	0	No more coddling, no more equivocation.
Obama	0	Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ?
Obama	0	military, financial, diplomatic ?
Obama	0	to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
Obama	0	The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ?
Obama	0	a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.
Obama	0	When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.
Obama	0	Such a timetable may now need to begin in 2007, but begin it must.
Obama	0	For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
Obama	0	that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq.
Obama	0	Let me be more specific.
Obama	0	The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.
Obama	0	He should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates.
Obama	0	When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ?
Obama	0	but it should not depend on Iraqi approval.
Obama	0	I am not suggesting that this timetable be overly-rigid.
Obama	0	We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
Obama	0	The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
Obama	0	Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put American troops in danger.
Obama	0	Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.
Obama	0	This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
Obama	0	Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
Obama	0	The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
Obama	0	Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos.
Obama	0	By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
Obama	0	As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
Obama	0	In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced U.S. force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time.
Obama	0	But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?
Obama	0	in a public and unambiguous way ?
Obama	0	for such continued support.
Obama	0	We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
Obama	0	Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.
Obama	0	The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
Obama	0	especially special forces ?
Obama	0	who are deployed with Iraqi as units advisers.
Obama	0	An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.
Obama	0	Let me emphasize one vital point ?
Obama	0	any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq.
Obama	0	In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
Obama	0	Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
Obama	0	We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
Obama	0	The security forces have to be far more inclusive ?
Obama	0	standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.
Obama	0	The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
Obama	0	So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.
Obama	0	But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.
Obama	0	Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.
Obama	0	This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.
Obama	0	This means no more bloated no-bid contracts that cost the taxpayers millions in overhead and administrative expenses.
Obama	0	We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
Obama	0	But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
Obama	0	Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
Obama	0	This includes opening dialogue with both Syria and Iran, an idea supported by both James Baker and Robert Gates.
Obama	0	We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
Obama	0	But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
Obama	0	and within their own countries.
Obama	0	And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.
Obama	0	The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
Obama	0	Make no mistake ?
Obama	0	if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
Obama	0	It is in our national interest to prevent this from happening.
Obama	0	We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
Obama	0	It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.
Obama	0	This brings me to a set of broader points.
Obama	0	As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
Obama	0	Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
Obama	0	But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?
Obama	0	that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.
Obama	0	And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
Obama	0	The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.
Obama	0	In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.
Obama	0	This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.
Obama	0	But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?
Obama	0	free markets, a free press, a strong civil society ?
Obama	0	cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun.
Obama	0	And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ?
Obama	0	especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ?
Obama	0	do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
Obama	0	The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.
Obama	0	Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
Obama	0	Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable.
Obama	0	If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
Obama	0	The final lesson is that in an interconnected world, the defeat of international terrorism ?
Obama	0	and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.
Obama	0	We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.
Obama	0	But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
Obama	0	This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.
Obama	0	We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?
Obama	0	threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.
Obama	0	The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
Obama	0	But there are many others.
Obama	0	The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
Obama	0	The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
Obama	0	In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.
Obama	0	And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
Obama	0	There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ?
Obama	0	and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.
Obama	0	According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.” We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
Obama	0	9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.
Obama	0	And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
Obama	0	But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
Obama	0	a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.
Obama	0	Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.
Obama	0	It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.
Obama	0	I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
Obama	0	I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
Obama	0	There have been too many speeches.
Obama	0	There have been too many excuses.
Obama	0	There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families.
Obama	0	The time for waiting in Iraq is over.
Obama	0	It is time to change our policy.
Obama	0	It is time to give Iraqis their country back.
Obama	0	And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Groundbreaking  TOPIC: Civil Rights November 13, 2006 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Groundbreaking Ceremony Complete Text THIS PARAGRAGH IS SPOKEN BEFORE THE VIDEO BEGINS : I want to thank first of all the King family, we would not be here without them, I want to thank Mr. Johnson and the foundation for allowing me to share this day with all of you.
Obama	0	I wish to recognize as well my colleagues in the United States Senate who have helped make today possible.
Obama	0	Senators Paul Sarbanes and John Warner, who wrote the bill for this memorial.
Obama	0	Senators Thad Cochran and Robert Byrd who appropriated the money to help build it.
Obama	0	Thank you all.
Obama	0	I have two daughters, ages five and eight.
Obama	0	And when I see the plans for this memorial, I think about what it will like when I first bring them here upon the memorial's completion.
Obama	0	I imagine us walking down to this tidal basin, between one memorial dedicated to the man who helped give birth to a nation, and another dedicated to the man who preserved it.
Obama	0	I picture us walking beneath the shadows cast by the Mountain of Despair, and gazing up at the Stone of Hope, and reading the quotes on the wall together as the water falls like rain.
Obama	0	And at some point, I know that one of my daughters will ask, perhaps my youngest, will ask, "Daddy, why is this monument here?
Obama	0	What did this man do?"
Obama	0	How might I answer them?
Obama	0	Unlike the others commemorated in this place, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was not a president of the United States - at no time in his life did he hold public office.
Obama	0	He was not a hero of foreign wars.
Obama	0	He never had much money, and while he lived he was reviled at least as much as he was celebrated.
Obama	0	By his own accounts, he was a man frequently racked with doubt, a man not without flaws, a man who, like Moses before him, more than once questioned why he had been chosen for so arduous a task - the task of leading a people to freedom, the task of healing the festering wounds of a nation's original sin.
Obama	0	And yet lead a nation he did.
Obama	0	Through words he gave voice to the voiceless.
Obama	0	Through deeds he gave courage to the faint of heart.
Obama	0	By dint of vision, and determination, and most of all faith in the redeeming power of love, he endured the humiliation of arrest, the loneliness of a prison cell, the constant threats to his life, until he finally inspired a nation to transform itself, and begin to live up to the meaning of its creed.
Obama	0	Like Moses before him, he would never live to see the Promised Land.
Obama	0	But from the mountain top, he pointed the way for us - a land no longer torn asunder with racial hatred and ethnic strife, a land that measured itself by how it treats the least of these, a land in which strength is defined not simply by the capacity to wage war but by the determination to forge peace - a land in which all of God's children might come together in a spirit of brotherhood.
Obama	0	We have not yet arrived at this longed for place.
Obama	0	For all the progress we have made, there are times when the land of our dreams recedes from us - when we are lost, wandering spirits, content with our suspicions and our angers, our long-held grudges and petty disputes, our frantic diversions and tribal allegiances.
Obama	0	And yet, by erecting this monument, we are reminded that this different, better place beckons us, and that we will find it not across distant hills or within some hidden valley, but rather we will find it somewhere in our hearts.
Obama	0	In the Book of Micah, Chapter 6, verse 8, the prophet says that God has already told us what is good.
Obama	0	"What doth the Lord require of thee, the verse tells us, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"
Obama	0	The man we honor today did what God required.
Obama	0	In the end, that is what I will tell my daughters - I will leave it to their teachers and their history books to tell them the rest.
Obama	0	As Dr. King asked to be remembered, I will tell them that this man gave his life serving others.
Obama	0	I will tell them that this man tried to love somebody.
Obama	0	I will tell them that because he did these things, they live today with the freedom God intended, their citizenship unquestioned, their dreams unbounded.
Obama	0	And I will tell them that they too can love.
Obama	0	That they too can serve.
Obama	0	And that each generation is beckoned anew, to fight for what is right, and strive for what is just, and to find within itself the spirit, the sense of purpose, that can remake a nation and transform a world.
Obama	0	Thank you very much.
Obama	0	Military Commission Legislation  TOPIC: Homeland Security September 28, 2006 Military Commission Legislation Statement Complete Text Mr. President, I am proud to be sponsoring this amendment with the senior senator from West Virginia.
Obama	0	He's absolutely right that Congress has abrogated its oversight responsibilities, and one way to reverse that troubling trend is to adopt a sunset provision in this bill.
Obama	0	We did that in the Patriot Act, and that allowed us to make important revisions to the bill that reflected our experience about what worked and didn't work during the previous 5 years.
Obama	0	We should do that again with this important piece of legislation.
Obama	0	But I want to take a few minutes to speak more broadly about the bill before us.
Obama	0	I may have only been in this body for a short while, but I am not naive to the political considerations that go along with many of the decisions we make here.
Obama	0	I realize that soon, we will adjourn for the fall, and the campaigning will begin in earnest.
Obama	0	And there will be 30-second attack ads and negative mail pieces, and we will be criticized as caring more about the rights of terrorists than the protection of Americans.
Obama	0	And I know that the vote before us was specifically designed and timed to add more fuel to that fire.
Obama	0	And yet, while I know all of this, I'm still disappointed.
Obama	0	Because what we're doing here today - a debate over the fundamental human rights of the accused - should be bigger than politics.
Obama	0	This is serious.
Obama	0	If this was a debate with obvious ideological differences - heartfelt convictions that couldn't be settled by compromise - I would understand.
Obama	0	But it's not.
Obama	0	All of us - Democrats and Republicans - want to do whatever it takes to track down terrorists and bring them to justice as swiftly as possible.
Obama	0	All of us want to give our President every tool necessary to do this.
Obama	0	And all of us were willing to do that in this bill.
Obama	0	Anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people.
Obama	0	In the five years that the President's system of military tribunals has existed, not one terrorist has been tried.
Obama	0	Not one has been convicted.
Obama	0	And in the end, the Supreme Court of the United found the whole thing unconstitutional, which is why we're here today.
Obama	0	We could have fixed all of this in a way that allows us to detain and interrogate and try suspected terrorists while still protecting the accidentally accused from spending their lives locked away in Guantanamo Bay.
Obama	0	Easily.
Obama	0	This was not an either-or question.
Obama	0	Instead of allowing this President - or any President - to decide what does and does not constitute torture, we could have left the definition up to our own laws and to the Geneva Conventions, as we would have if we passed the bill that the Armed Services committee originally offered.
Obama	0	Instead of detainees arriving at Guantanamo and facing a Combatant Status Review Tribunal that allows them no real chance to prove their innocence with evidence or a lawyer, we could have developed a real military system of justice that would sort out the suspected terrorists from the accidentally accused.
Obama	0	And instead of not just suspending, but eliminating, the right of habeas corpus - the seven century-old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention, we could have given the accused one chance - one single chance - to ask the government why they are being held and what they are being charged with.
Obama	0	But politics won today.
Obama	0	Politics won.
Obama	0	The Administration got its vote, and now it will have its victory lap, and now they will be able to go out on the campaign trail and tell the American people that they were the ones who were tough on the terrorists.
Obama	0	And yet, we have a bill that gives the terrorist mastermind of 9/11 his day in court, but not the innocent people we may have accidentally rounded up and mistaken for terrorists - people who may stay in prison for the rest of their lives.
Obama	0	And yet, we have a report authored by sixteen of our own government's intelligence agencies, a previous draft of which described, and I quote, "...actions by the United States government that were determined to have stoked the jihad movement, like the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay..." And yet, we have Al Qaeda and the Taliban regrouping in Afghanistan while we look the other way.
Obama	0	We have a war in Iraq that our own government's intelligence says is serving as Al Qaeda's best recruitment tool.
Obama	0	And we have recommendations from the bipartisan 9/11 commission that we still refuse to implement five years after the fact.
Obama	0	The problem with this bill is not that it's too tough on terrorists.
Obama	0	The problem with this bill is that it's sloppy.
Obama	0	And the reason it's sloppy is because we rushed it to serve political purposes instead of taking the time to do the job right.
Obama	0	I've heard, for example, the argument that it should be military courts, and not federal judges, who should make decisions on these detainees.
Obama	0	I actually agree with that.
Obama	0	The problem is that the structure of the military proceedings has been poorly thought through.
Obama	0	Indeed, the regulations that are supposed to be governing administrative hearings for these detainees, which should have been issued months ago, still haven't been issued.
Obama	0	Instead, we have rushed through a bill that stands a good chance of being challenged once again in the Supreme Court.
Obama	0	This is not how a serious Administration would approach the problem of terrorism.
Obama	0	I know the President came here today and was insisting that this is supposed to be our primary concern.
Obama	0	He's absolutely right it should be our primary concern - which is why we should be approaching this with a somberness and seriousness that this Administration has not displayed with this legislation.
Obama	0	Now, let me be clear - for those who plot terror against the United States, I hope God has mercy on their soul, because I certainly do not.
Obama	0	And for those who our government suspects of terror, I support whatever tools are necessary to try them and uncover their plot.
Obama	0	But we also know that some have been detained who have no connection to terror whatsoever.
Obama	0	We've already had reports from the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantanamo shouldn't have been there - as one U.S. commander of Guantanamo told the Wall Street Journal, "Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks."
Obama	0	And we all know about the recent case of the Canadian man who was suspected of terrorist connections, detained in New York, sent to Syria, and tortured, only to find out later that it was all a case of mistaken identity and poor information.
Obama	0	In the future, people like this may never have a chance to prove their innocence.
Obama	0	They may remain locked away forever.
Obama	0	And the sad part about all of this is that this betrayal of American values is unnecessary.
Obama	0	We could've drafted a bipartisan, well-structured bill that provided adequate due process through the military courts, had an effective review process that would've prevented frivolous lawsuits being filed and kept lawyers from clogging our courts, but upheld the basic ideals that have made this country great.
Obama	0	Instead, what we have is a flawed document that in fact betrays the best instincts of some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle - those who worked in a bipartisan fashion in the Armed Services Committee to craft a bill that we could have been proud of.
Obama	0	And they essentially got steamrolled by this Administration and by the imperatives of November 7th.
Obama	0	That is not how we should be doing business in the U.S. Senate, and that's not how we should be prosecuting this war on terrorism.
Obama	0	When we're sloppy and cut corners, we are undermining those very virtues of America that will lead us to success in winning this war.
Obama	0	At bare minimum, I hope we can at least pass this provision so that cooler heads can prevail after the silly season of politics is over.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Floor Statement Habeas Corpus Amendment  Habeas Corpus Statement Video - PART 1   Habeas Corpus Statement Video - PART 2 TOPIC: Homeland Security September 27, 2006 Floor Statement on the Habeas Corpus Amendment Complete Text Mr. OBAMA.
Obama	0	Mr. President, I would like to address the habeas corpus amendment that is on the floor and that we just heard a lengthy debate about between Senator Specter and Senator Warner.
Obama	0	A few years ago, I gave a speech in Boston that people talk about from time to time.
Obama	0	In that speech, I spoke about why I love this country, why I love America, and what I believe sets this country apart from so many other nations in so many areas.
Obama	0	I said:   That is the true genius of America--a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles; that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm; that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door.
Obama	0	.....
Obama	0	Without hearing a sudden knock on the door.
Obama	0	I bring this up because what is at stake in this bill, and in the amendment that is currently being debated, is the right, in some sense, for people who hear that knock on the door and are placed in detention because the Government suspects them of terrorist activity to effectively challenge their detention by our Government.
Obama	0	Now, under the existing rules of the Detainee Treatment Act, court review of anyone's detention is severely restricted.
Obama	0	Fortunately, the Supreme Court in Hamdan ensured that some meaningful review would take place.
Obama	0	But in the absence of Senator Specter's amendment that is currently pending, we will essentially be going back to the same situation as if the Supreme Court had never ruled in Hamdan, a situation in which detainees effectively have no access to anything other than the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, or the CSRT.
Obama	0	Now, I think it is important for all of us to understand exactly the procedures that are currently provided for under the CSRT.
Obama	0	I have actually read a few of the transcripts of proceedings under the CSRT.
Obama	0	And I can tell you that oftentimes they provide detainees no meaningful recourse if the Government has the wrong guy.
Obama	0	Essentially, reading these transcripts, they proceed as follows: The Government says: You are a member of the Taliban.
Obama	0	And the detainee will say: No, I'm not.
Obama	0	And then the Government will not ask for proof from the detainee that he is not.
Obama	0	There is no evidence that the detainee can offer to rebut the Government's charge.
Obama	0	The Government then moves on and says: And on such and such a date, you perpetrated such and such terrorist crime.
Obama	0	And the detainee says: No, I didn't.
Obama	0	You have the wrong guy.
Obama	0	But again, he has no capacity to place into evidence anything that would rebut the Government's charge.
Obama	0	And there is no effort to find out whether or not what he is saying is true.
Obama	0	And it proceeds like that until effectively the Government says, OK, that is the end of the tribunal, and he goes back to detention.
Obama	0	Even if there is evidence that he was not involved in any terrorist activity, he may not have any mechanism to introduce that evidence into the hearing.
Obama	0	Now, the vast majority of the folks in Guantanamo, I suspect, are there for a reason.
Obama	0	There are a lot of dangerous people.
Obama	0	Particularly dangerous are people like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.
Obama	0	Ironically, those are the guys who are going to get real military procedures because they are going to be charged by the Government.
Obama	0	But detainees who have not committed war crimes--or where the Government's case is not strong--may not have any recourse whatsoever.
Obama	0	The bottom line is this: Current procedures under the CSRT are such that a perfectly innocent individual could be held and could not rebut the Government's case and has no way of proving his innocence.
Obama	0	I would like somebody in this Chamber, somebody in this Government, to tell me why this is necessary.
Obama	0	I do not want to hear that this is a new world and we face a new kind of enemy.
Obama	0	I know that.
Obama	0	I know that every time I think about my two little girls and worry for their safety--when I wonder if I really can tuck them in at night and know that they are safe from harm.
Obama	0	I have as big of a stake as anybody on the other side of the aisle and anybody in this administration in capturing terrorists and incapacitating them.
Obama	0	I would gladly take up arms myself against any terrorist threat to make sure my family is protected.
Obama	0	But as a parent, I can also imagine the terror I would feel if one of my family members were rounded up in the middle of the night and sent to Guantanamo without even getting one chance to ask why they were being held and being able to prove their innocence.
Obama	0	This is not just an entirely fictional scenario, by the way.
Obama	0	We have already had reports by the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantanamo should not have been there.
Obama	0	As one U.S. commander of Guantanamo told the Wall Street Journal: Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks.
Obama	0	We all know about the recent case of the Canadian man who was suspected of terrorist connections, detained in New York, sent to Syria--through a rendition agreement--tortured, only to find out later it was all a case of mistaken identity and poor information.
Obama	0	In this war, where terrorists can plot undetected from within our borders, it is absolutely vital that our law enforcement agencies are able to detain and interrogate whoever they believe to be a suspect, and so it is understandable that mistakes will be made and identities will be confused.
Obama	0	I don't blame the Government for that.
Obama	0	This is an extraordinarily difficult war we are prosecuting against terrorists.
Obama	0	There are going to be situations in which we cast too wide a net and capture the wrong person.
Obama	0	But what is avoidable is refusing to ever allow our legal system to correct these mistakes.
Obama	0	By giving suspects a chance--even one chance--to challenge the terms of their detention in court, to have a judge confirm that the Government has detained the right person for the right suspicions, we could solve this problem without harming our efforts in the war on terror one bit.
Obama	0	Let me respond to a couple of points that have been made on the other side.
Obama	0	You will hear opponents of this amendment say it will give all kinds of rights to terrorist masterminds, such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.
Obama	0	But that is not true.
Obama	0	The irony of the underlying bill as it is written is that someone like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is going to get basically a full military trial, with all of the bells and whistles.
Obama	0	He will have counsel, he will be able to present evidence, and he will be able to rebut the Government's case.
Obama	0	The feeling is that he is guilty of a war crime and to do otherwise might violate some of our agreements under the Geneva Conventions.
Obama	0	I think that is good, that we are going to provide him with some procedure and process.
Obama	0	I think we will convict him, and I think he will be brought to justice.
Obama	0	I think justice will be carried out in his case.
Obama	0	But that won't be true for the detainees who are never charged with a terrorist crime, who have not committed a war crime.
Obama	0	Under this bill, people who may have been simply at the wrong place at the wrong time--and there may be just a few--will never get a chance to appeal their detention.
Obama	0	So, essentially, the weaker the Government's case is against you, the fewer rights you have.
Obama	0	Senator Specter's amendment would fix that, while still ensuring that terrorists like Mohammed are swiftly brought to justice.
Obama	0	You are also going to hear a lot about how lawyers are going to file all kinds of frivolous lawsuits on behalf of detainees if habeas corpus is in place.
Obama	0	This is a cynical argument because I think we could get overwhelming support in this Chamber right now for a measure that would restrict habeas to a one-shot appeal that would be limited solely to whether someone was legally detained or not.
Obama	0	I am not interested in allowing folks at Guantanamo to complain about whether their cell is too small or whether the food they get is sufficiently edible or to their tastes.
Obama	0	That is not what this is about.
Obama	0	We can craft a habeas bill that says the only question before the court is whether there is sufficient evidence to find that this person is truly an unlawful enemy combatant and belongs in this detention center.
Obama	0	We can restrict it to that.
Obama	0	And although I have seen some of those amendments floating around, those were not amendments that were admitted during this debate.
Obama	0	It is a problem that is easily addressed.
Obama	0	It is not a reason for us to wholesale eliminate habeas corpus.
Obama	0	Finally, you will hear some Senators argue that if habeas is allowed, it renders the CSRT process irrelevant because the courts will embark on de novo review, meaning they will completely retry these cases, take new evidence.
Obama	0	So whatever findings were made in the CSRT are not really relevant because the court is essentially going to start all over again.
Obama	0	I actually think some of these Senators are right on this point.
Obama	0	I believe we could actually set up a system in which a military tribunal is sufficient to make a determination as to whether someone is an enemy combatant and would not require the sort of traditional habeas corpus that is called for as a consequence of this amendment, where the court's role is simply to see whether proper procedures were met.
Obama	0	The problem is that the way the CSRT is currently designed is so insufficient that we can anticipate the Supreme Court overturning this underlying bill, once again, in the absence of habeas corpus review.
Obama	0	I have had conversations with some of the sponsors of the underlying bill who say they agree that we have to beef up the CSRT procedures.
Obama	0	Well, if we are going to revisit the CSRT procedures to make them stronger and make sure they comport with basic due process, why not leave habeas corpus in place until we have actually fixed it up to our satisfaction?
Obama	0	Why rush through it 2 days before we are supposed to adjourn?
Obama	0	Because some on the other side of the aisle want to go campaign on the issue of who is tougher on terrorism and national security.
Obama	0	Since 9/11, Americans have been asked to give up certain conveniences and civil liberties--long waits in airport security lines, random questioning because of a foreign-sounding last name--so that the Government can defeat terrorism wherever it may exist.
Obama	0	It is a tough balance to strike.
Obama	0	I think we have to acknowledge that whoever was in power right now, whoever was in the White House, whichever party was in control, that we would have to do some balancing between civil liberties and our need for security and to get tough on those who would do us harm.
Obama	0	Most of us have been willing to make some sacrifices because we know that, in the end, it helps to make us safer.
Obama	0	But restricting somebody's right to challenge their imprisonment indefinitely is not going to make us safer.
Obama	0	In fact, recent evidence shows it is probably making us less safe.
Obama	0	In Sunday's New York Times, it was reported that previous drafts of the recently released National Intelligence Estimate, a report of 16 different Government intelligence agencies, describe: ..... actions by the United States Government that were determined to have stoked the jihad movement, like the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.
Obama	0	.....
Obama	0	This is not just unhelpful in our fight against terror, it is unnecessary.
Obama	0	We don't need to imprison innocent people to win this war.
Obama	0	For people who are guilty, we have the procedures in place to lock them up.
Obama	0	That is who we are as a people.
Obama	0	We do things right, and we do things fair.
Obama	0	Two days ago, every Member of this body received a letter, signed by 35 U.S. diplomats, many of whom served under Republican Presidents.
Obama	0	They urged us to reconsider eliminating the rights of habeas corpus from this bill, saying: To deny habeas corpus to our detainees can be seen as a prescription for how the captured members of our own military, diplomatic, and NGO personnel stationed abroad may be treated.
Obama	0	.....
Obama	0	The Congress has every duty to insure their protection, and to avoid anything which will be taken as a justification, even by the most disturbed minds, that arbitrary arrest is the acceptable norm of the day in the relations between nations, and that judicial inquiry is an antique, trivial and dispensable luxury.
Obama	0	The world is watching what we do today in America.
Obama	0	They will know what we do here today, and they will treat all of us accordingly in the future--our soldiers, our diplomats, our journalists, anybody who travels beyond these borders.
Obama	0	I hope we remember this as we go forward.
Obama	0	I sincerely hope we can protect what has been called the ``great writ''--a writ that has been in place in the Anglo-American legal system for over 700 years.
Obama	0	Mr. President, this should not be a difficult vote.
Obama	0	I hope we pass this amendment because I think it is the only way to make sure this underlying bill preserves all the great traditions of our legal system and our way of life.
Obama	0	I yield the floor.
Obama	0	Energy Independence  TOPIC: Oil & Alternative Fuels September 20, 2006 Energy Independence: A Call for Leadership Complete Text Now that summer's over and gas prices have finally come down a bit, there's a temptation to put any discussion about energy on the back burner until the next crisis arises.
Obama	0	Gone are the days when the President would make sweeping pronouncements in his State of the Union about America's addiction to oil - today there is far more political mileage out of questioning Democrats' commitment to fighting terror than by affirming America's commitment to energy independence.
Obama	0	But as the President may or may not have learned by now, simply ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away.
Obama	0	Because while headlines about price gouging and gas lines have temporarily faded from the news, new headlines have emerged that should have us every bit as concerned about the addiction we just can't seem to shake.
Obama	0	In just the last week, two in particular caught my eye.
Obama	0	One is from the Detroit Free Press, and it talks about how Ford Motor Company plans to cut 30,000 hourly jobs, 14,000 salaried jobs, and close sixteen plants by 2012.
Obama	0	Now, there are plenty of reasons for Ford's financial troubles, but one of the most glaring has been their inability to compete with foreign counterparts by transitioning to the fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles that represent the future of the auto industry.
Obama	0	200,000 of these hybrids are driving around China today, a country that already has a higher fuel economy than we do.
Obama	0	Over in Japan, Toyota is doubling production of the popular Prius to sell 100,000 in the U.S. this year.
Obama	0	But at Ford, there are plans to make only 20,000 Escape Hybrids in 2006, and GM's brand won't be on the market until 2007.
Obama	0	Meanwhile, the waiting lists for a hybrid car in this country get longer by the day.
Obama	0	These foreign auto companies are out-innovating and out-competing us, and if we do nothing to help U.S. carmakers, tens of thousands more jobs and billions in business will be heading overseas in the months to come.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, job losses and foreign competition are just the half of it.
Obama	0	Because the second headline that caught my eye was in Saturday's New York Times, and it read, "Suicide Attacks Foiled at 2 Oil Sites in Yemen."
Obama	0	This news is disturbing, but not surprising.
Obama	0	For years, Al Qaeda has been trying to attack Middle Eastern oil refineries as a way to wreak havoc on the U.S. economy.
Obama	0	Osama bin Laden himself has said, "Focus your operations on oil, especially in Iraq and the Gulf area, since this will cause them to die off [on their own]."
Obama	0	In the past, even minor attacks have caused global prices to jump $2 per barrel in a single day.
Obama	0	And a former CIA agent tells us that if terrorists ever succeeded in destroying an entire oil complex, it could take enough oil off the market to cause financial catastrophe in America.
Obama	0	More than anything else, headlines like these represent a realization that goes far beyond the temporary rise and fall of gas prices.
Obama	0	It's a realization that for all of our economic dominance - for all of our military might - the Achilles heel of the most powerful country on Earth is the oil we cannot live without.
Obama	0	The President knows this.
Obama	0	That thousands of autoworkers are losing their jobs.
Obama	0	That we spend $18 million on foreign oil ever hour.
Obama	0	That our climate is changing and global temperatures are rising.
Obama	0	And yet, for someone who talks tough about defending America, actually solving our energy crisis seems to factor pretty low on the President's agenda.
Obama	0	And that's because as much as George Bush might want to defend America, he also needs to defend his vision of government - and that's a government that can't, won't, and shouldn't solve great national challenges like our energy dependence.
Obama	0	That's why the President's funding for renewable fuels is at the same level it was the day he took office.
Obama	0	That's why his budget funds less then half of the energy bill he himself signed into law.
Obama	0	That's why billions of tax dollars that could've been used to fund energy research went to the record-profiting oil companies instead.
Obama	0	And that's why it's time to stand up for a new vision of government this November.
Obama	0	You see, it's this timidity - this smallness - in our politics that's holding us back right now.
Obama	0	The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away.
Obama	0	But that's not where the American people are.
Obama	0	They still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.
Obama	0	They still dream big dreams - they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.
Obama	0	There's a reason that some have compared the quest for energy independence to the Manhattan Project or the Apollo moon landing.
Obama	0	Like those historic efforts, moving away from an oil economy is a major challenge that will require a sustained national commitment.
Obama	0	During World War II, we had an entire country working around the clock to produce enough planes and tanks to beat the Axis powers.
Obama	0	In the middle of the Cold War, we built a national highway system so we had a quick way to transport military equipment across the country.
Obama	0	When we wanted to beat the Russians into space, we poured millions into a national education initiative that graduated thousands of new scientists and engineers.
Obama	0	If we hope to strengthen our security and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, we can offer no less of a commitment to energy independence.
Obama	0	With technology we have on the shelves right now and fuels we can grow right here in America, by 2025 we can reduce our oil imports by over 7.5. million barrels per day - an amount greater than all the oil we are expected to import from the entire Middle East.
Obama	0	We start by producing cars that use less oil.
Obama	0	The auto industry has not been asked to raise fuel economy standards in seventeen years, and lately we've just stopped asking them to.
Obama	0	Today, we have no choice.
Obama	0	Starting in 2008, if we raised CAF'E standards a modest 3% a year over the next twelve years, by 2020 passenger vehicles would average 40.5 mpg and light trucks would average 32.6 mpg.
Obama	0	This is by no means a dramatic increase - five years ago, the National Academy of Sciences concluded that raising CAF'E to 33 mpg for passenger cars could easily be done without compromising passenger safety.
Obama	0	Not only would this reduce America's oil consumption, but it would increase profits for the auto industry.
Obama	0	Yesterday a University of Michigan report came out that said if the Big Three automakers took proactive steps to increase the fuel-efficiency of their vehicles, they would stand to gain up to $2 billion more in profits per year.
Obama	0	But if they continue on their current path, they could stand to lose up to $3.6 billion in profits.
Obama	0	Of course, auto executives are right when they say that transitioning to these more fuel-efficient automobiles would be costly at a time of sagging profits and stiff competition, and that's precisely why the federal government shouldn't let the industry face these costs on their own.
Obama	0	We should strike a grand bargain with the Big Three automakers where the government picks up part of the tab for their retiree health care costs - a tab that ran almost $6.7 billion just last year - in exchange for the car companies using that savings to invest in more fuel-efficient cars.
Obama	0	Beyond raising CAFE, however, it's time we replace oil altogether as America's fuel of choice.
Obama	0	This doesn't just mean singing the praises of ethanol and hoping that it finds its way into our fuel supply on its own.
Obama	0	It means taking major steps now to put a national biofuel infrastructure in place.
Obama	0	Already, some cars on the road have the flexible-fuel tanks necessary for them to run on E85, a cheaper, cleaner blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.
Obama	0	But millions upon millions of cars still don't have these tanks.
Obama	0	It's time for them to install those tanks in every single car they make, and it's time for the government to cover this small cost, which currently runs at just $100 per car.
Obama	0	We should also make sure that from now on, every single automobile the government purchases is a flex-fuel vehicle.
Obama	0	It's also a time to start making E85 fueling stations more available to the public.
Obama	0	Currently, only 681 out of 170,000 fueling stations in America offer E85 pumps.
Obama	0	This is not acceptable.
Obama	0	Every American should have the choice to fill up their car with E85 at any fueling station.
Obama	0	And oil companies should stop standing in the way and join us in making this happen.
Obama	0	If the big oil companies would devote just 1% of their first quarter profits this year to install E85 pumps, more than 7,000 service stations would be able to serve E85 to hungry motorists.
Obama	0	Finally, we should reduce the risk of investing in renewable fuels by providing loan guarantees and venture capital to those entrepreneurs with the best plans to develop and sell biofuels.
Obama	0	And we should create a market for renewable fuels by ramping up the renewable fuel standard and creating an alternative diesel standard in this country that together would blend 65 billion gallons of renewable fuels into the petroleum supply each year.
Obama	0	In the days and months after September 11th, Americans were waiting to be called to something bigger than themselves.
Obama	0	Just like their parents and grandparents of the Greatest Generation, they were willing to serve and defend their country - not only on the fields of war, but on the homefront too.
Obama	0	This is our chance to step up and serve.
Obama	0	For decades, we have heard President after President call for energy independence in this country, but for decades, we have fallen short.
Obama	0	Well it's time to call on ourselves.
Obama	0	We shouldn't wait for the next time gas hits $3 a gallon - and we shouldn't accept any more headlines that talk about a dying auto industry or a terrorist plot to use oil as a weapon against America.
Obama	0	We should act - and we should act now.
Obama	0	Now is the time for serious leadership to get us started down the path of energy independence.
Obama	0	Now is the time for this call to arms.
Obama	0	I hope some of the ideas I've laid out today can serve as a basis for this call, but I also hope that members of both parties and all levels of government can come together in the near future to launch this serious quest for energy independence.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	An Honest Government - A Hopeful Future - University of Nairobi  TOPIC: Our Past, Our Future & Vision for America August 28, 2006 An Honest Government, A Hopeful Future University of Nairobi Nairobi, Kenya Complete Text The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987.
Obama	0	I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.
Obama	0	My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month.
Obama	0	My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip.
Obama	0	Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old.
Obama	0	When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road.
Obama	0	I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi.
Obama	0	When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap.
Obama	0	But it was a magical trip.
Obama	0	To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.
Obama	0	I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left.
Obama	0	And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him.
Obama	0	I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life.
Obama	0	I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
Obama	0	I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult.
Obama	0	I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
Obama	0	In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.
Obama	0	And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments.
Obama	0	His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
Obama	0	And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.
Obama	0	In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole.
Obama	0	The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
Obama	0	But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
Obama	0	One statistic powerfully describes this unfulfilled promise.
Obama	0	In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea.
Obama	0	Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's.
Obama	0	How can we explain this fact?
Obama	0	Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
Obama	0	We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
Obama	0	And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.
Obama	0	So what explains this?
Obama	0	I believe there a number of factors at work.
Obama	0	Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.
Obama	0	It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.
Obama	0	Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation.
Obama	0	This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.
Obama	0	Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.
Obama	0	When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.
Obama	0	And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: "Power concedes nothing without a demand.
Obama	0	It never did, and it never will."
Obama	0	As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.
Obama	0	This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth.
Obama	0	Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors.
Obama	0	As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
Obama	0	And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity.
Obama	0	A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.
Obama	0	But, Kenya must do its part.
Obama	0	It cannot wait for other nations to act first.
Obama	0	The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind.
Obama	0	It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind.
Obama	0	Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.
Obama	0	One that serves its people and is free from corruption.
Obama	0	There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring.
Obama	0	Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.
Obama	0	You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
Obama	0	And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy.
Obama	0	It is being threatened by corruption.
Obama	0	Corruption is not a new problem.
Obama	0	It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem.
Obama	0	It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society.
Obama	0	My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.
Obama	0	In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.
Obama	0	But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.
Obama	0	I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.
Obama	0	And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
Obama	0	It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
Obama	0	It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground.
Obama	0	In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else.
Obama	0	And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.
Obama	0	Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate.
Obama	0	It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought.
Obama	0	What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
Obama	0	It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
Obama	0	Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
Obama	0	Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.
Obama	0	Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust.
Obama	0	In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
Obama	0	And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.
Obama	0	The good news is that there are already signs of progress here.
Obama	0	Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya.
Obama	0	The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
Obama	0	Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002.
Obama	0	This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.
Obama	0	But elections are not enough.
Obama	0	In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.
Obama	0	Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
Obama	0	The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
Obama	0	And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.
Obama	0	I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
Obama	0	We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.
Obama	0	And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
Obama	0	So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
Obama	0	Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.
Obama	0	And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
Obama	0	Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.
Obama	0	In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
Obama	0	Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
Obama	0	Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop.
Obama	0	It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
Obama	0	It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society.
Obama	0	Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.
Obama	0	Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
Obama	0	An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle.
Obama	0	When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
Obama	0	Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
Obama	0	The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses.
Obama	0	The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya.
Obama	0	But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid.
Obama	0	As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
Obama	0	And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be.
Obama	0	By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
Obama	0	By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
Obama	0	They fight the fight of our time.
Obama	0	Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too.
Obama	0	You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way.
Obama	0	You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth.
Obama	0	And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
Obama	0	This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
Obama	0	I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
Obama	0	As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
Obama	0	Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
Obama	0	I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
Obama	0	As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments.
Obama	0	We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.
Obama	0	In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
Obama	0	I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Xavier University Commencement Address - New Orleans   TOPIC: Commencement and Katrina & Gulf Recovery August 11, 2006 Xavier University Commencement Address New Orleans, Louisiana Complete Text Good afternoon President Francis, the Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, and the Class of 2006.
Obama	0	I want to start by thanking you all for allowing me to share in your miracle today.
Obama	0	Over the past year there has been no shortage of doubts about whether this college would live to see another commencement - and doubts remain still about the future of this great city.
Obama	0	But on this summer's day in New Orleans, less than one year after the worst storm in American history beat down your door, I look out at the largest class to ever graduate from this college and know that one thing is certain - Xavier University is back.
Obama	0	I have to say that I'm pretty humbled to be here.
Obama	0	Each year there are hundreds of commencements in this country.
Obama	0	All are hopeful, some are inspiring, and most of you probably won't even remember who your speaker was ten years from now.
Obama	0	As a rule, they usually involve an old guy like me giving young folks like you advice about what to expect in the real world - advice about the challenges you'll face and the obstacles you'll have to overcome.
Obama	0	But this is different.
Obama	0	In the last month, I have walked among New Orleans' battered homes and empty streets and scattered debris that prove armies aren't the only ones who can wage wars on cities.
Obama	0	I have seen pictures of Xavier after the storm - the submerged classrooms and the shattered windows and the dorm rooms that were left with books sitting open on desks and clothes still unpacked on the bed.
Obama	0	And I have heard the story of nearly 400 students and faculty who were trapped on campus in the days after Katrina - waiting on the roof to be rescued with a sign that simply read "Help Us."
Obama	0	And as I thought about all of this, it dawned on me that when it comes to giving advice about challenges and obstacles, it's you who could probably teach the rest of us a thing or two about what it takes to overcome.
Obama	0	I could give you a lecture on courage, but some of you know what it is to wait huddled in the dark without electricity or running water, wondering if a helicopter or boat will come for you before the gunshots get closer or the food runs out or the waters rise.
Obama	0	I could talk at length about perseverance, but this is a class that was forced to scatter to schools across the country at the beginning of your senior year, leaving everything you knew behind while you waited to find out if you could ever come back.
Obama	0	And I could go on and on about the importance of community - about what it means to care for each other - but this is a school where so many sacrificed so much in order to open your doors in January; a triumph that showed the rest of America that there are those who refuse to desert this city and its people no matter what.
Obama	0	Yours has been an education that cannot simply be measured in the tests you've taken or the diploma you're about to receive.
Obama	0	For it has also been an education in humanity, brought about by a force of nature - a lesson in both our capacity for good and in the imperfections of man; in our ability to rise to great challenges and our tendency to sometimes fall short of our obligations to one another.
Obama	0	Some will take an entire lifetime to experience these lessons - others never will.
Obama	0	But as some of Katrina's youngest survivors, you've had a front row seat.
Obama	0	So what does this mean for you?
Obama	0	Well, lessons can be just as easily unlearned as they are learned.
Obama	0	Time may heal, but it can also cloud the memory and remove us further from that initial core of concern.
Obama	0	And so what this all means is that today and every day, you have a responsibility to remember what happened here in New Orleans.
Obama	0	To make it a part of who you are.
Obama	0	To let its lessons guide you as face your own challenges.
Obama	0	After all, Katrina may well be the most dramatic test you face in life, but it will by no means be the last.
Obama	0	There will be quiet tests of character - the shoulder you lend a friend during their time of need; the way you raise your children; the care you give a loved one who's sick or dying; the integrity and honesty with which you carry yourself.
Obama	0	There will be powerful personal tests - the profession you choose, the legacy you leave, your ability to handle failure and disappointment.
Obama	0	And of course, there are the tests you will face as citizen - whether you use your voice to rage against injustice; whether you use your time to give back to your community; whether you use your passion to commit yourself to a cause larger than yourself.
Obama	0	In most of these tests, there are two different paths you can take.
Obama	0	One is easy.
Obama	0	After graduating from a great school like Xavier, you'll pretty much be able to punch your own ticket - which means you can take your diploma, walk off this stage, leave this city, and go chasing after the big house and the large salary and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should buy.
Obama	0	You can live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the same schools, and narrow your concerns to what's going in your own little circle.
Obama	0	And when you turn on the TV or open the newspaper and hear about all the trouble in the world, there will be pundits and politicians who'll tell you that it's someone else's fault and someone else's problem to fix.
Obama	0	They'll tell you that the Americans who sleep in the streets and beg for food got there because they're all lazy or weak of spirit.
Obama	0	That the immigrants who risk their lives to cross a desert have nothing to contribute to this country and no desire to embrace our ideals.
Obama	0	That the inner-city children who are trapped in dilapidated schools can't learn and won't learn and so we should just give up on them entirely.
Obama	0	That the innocent people being slaughtered and expelled from their homes in Darfur are somebody else's problem to take care of.
Obama	0	And when you hear all this, the easiest thing in the world will be to do nothing at all.
Obama	0	To turn off the TV, put down the paper, and walk away from the stories about Iraq or poverty or violence or joblessness or hopelessness.
Obama	0	To go about your busy lives - to remain detached; to remain indifferent; to remain safe.
Obama	0	But if you should ever think about taking this path, I ask you first to remember.
Obama	0	Remember witnessing the pain that neglect and indifference can cause - how entire neighborhoods in this city were left to drown because no one thought to make sure that every person had the means to escape.
Obama	0	Remember what happens when responsibilities are ignored and bucks are passed - when the White House blames FEMA and FEMA blames the state of Louisiana and pretty soon no one's fixing the problem because everyone thought somebody else would.
Obama	0	And whenever you're tempted to view the poor or the ill or the persecuted as "those people" - people in their own world with their own problems - remember always your neighbors in places like the 9th ward; men and women and children who, just like you, wanted desperately to escape to somewhere better.
Obama	0	And if you remember all of this - if you remember what happened here in New Orleans - if you allow it to change you forever - know that there is another path you can take.
Obama	0	This one is more difficult.
Obama	0	It asks more of you.
Obama	0	It asks you to leave here and not just pursue your own individual dreams, but to help perfect our collective dream as a nation.
Obama	0	It asks you to realize there is more to life than being rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained.
Obama	0	It asks you to recognize that there are people out there who need you.
Obama	0	You know, there's a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit.
Obama	0	But I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit - the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes; to see the world through the eyes of those who are different from us - the child who's hungry, the steelworker who's been laid-off, the family who lost the entire life they built together when the storm came to town.
Obama	0	When you think like this - when you choose to broaden your ambit of concern and empathize with the plight of others, whether they are close friends or distant strangers - it becomes harder not to act; harder not to help.
Obama	0	For each of you, this desire to do for others and serve your communities will come even easier if you allow yourself to remember what you saw here in New Orleans.
Obama	0	Because aside from all the bad that came from Katrina - the failures and the neglect, the incompetence and the apathy - you were also witness to a good that many forgot was even possible.
Obama	0	You saw people from every corner of this country drop what they were doing, leave their homes, and come to New Orleans - Americans who didn't know a soul in the entire city who found their own piece of driftwood, built their own make-shift raft, and waded through the streets of this city, saving anyone they could.
Obama	0	You saw the doctors and the nurses who refused to leave their city and their patients even when they were told time and again by local officials that it was no longer safe - even when helicopters were waiting to take them away.
Obama	0	Men and women who stayed to care for the sick and dying long after their medical equipment and electricity were gone.
Obama	0	And after the storm had passed, you saw a spirit of generosity that spanned an entire globe, with billions upon billions in donations coming from tiny, far-off nations like Qatar and Sri Lanka.
Obama	0	Think about that.
Obama	0	These are places a lot of folks couldn't even identify on a map.
Obama	0	Sri Lanka was still recovering from the devastation caused by last year's Tsunami.
Obama	0	And yet, they heard about our tragedy, and they gave.
Obama	0	Remember always this goodness.
Obama	0	Remember always that while many in Washington and on all levels of government failed New Orleans, there were plenty of ordinary people who displayed extraordinary humanity during this city's hour of need.
Obama	0	In the years to come, return this favor to those who are forced to weather their own storms - be it the loss of a job or a slide into poverty; an unexpected illness or an unforeseen eviction.
Obama	0	And in returning these favors, seek also to make this a nation of no more Katrinas.
Obama	0	Make this a nation where we never again leave behind any American by ensuring that every American has a job that can support a family and health care in case they get sick and a good education for their child and a secure retirement they can count on.
Obama	0	Make this a nation where we are never again caught unprepared to meet the challenges of our time - where we free ourselves from a dependence on oil and protect our cities from both forces of terror and nature.
Obama	0	Make this a nation that is worthy of the sacrifices of so many of its citizens, and in doing so, make real the observation made by a visitor to our country so many centuries ago: "America is great because Americans are good."
Obama	0	I ask you to take this second path - this harder path - not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation.
Obama	0	Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.
Obama	0	I ask you to take it because you have an obligation to yourself.
Obama	0	Because our individual salvation depends on our collective salvation.
Obama	0	And because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential.
Obama	0	It is said that faith is a belief in things not seen, and miracles, by their nature, are inexplicable gifts from God.
Obama	0	But sometimes, if we look hard enough at the moments we triumph against the greatest of odds, we can see His will at work in the people He loves.
Obama	0	It's now well-known in this community that when your President, Norman Francis, promised to re-open this school by January, he joked that his decision would be recorded by history as either "crazy and stupid" or "bold and visionary."
Obama	0	And when I heard that, I wondered where you find the courage to make such a crazy, visionary promise - and where you find the commitment to keep it.
Obama	0	And I thought, Norman Francis is someone who remembers - remembers where he came from, remembers the lessons he learned, remembers the opportunities he's had, and lives his life according to those memories.
Obama	0	Born in Lafayette before Civil Rights and Voting Rights were even a possibility, this is a man who was raised in poverty, earning extra money for his parents as a child by shining shoes.
Obama	0	He studied hard through high school, put himself through Xavier by working long hours in the library, and became the first ever African American to be accepted into Loyola's Law School.
Obama	0	He graduated that law school and could've gone anywhere and made any amount of money - but Norman Francis wanted to help people learn because he remembered all the people who helped him.
Obama	0	And so he came back to Xavier, and he worked his way up through the ranks, and he became the first ever African-American president of this school at just thirty-six years old.
Obama	0	Since that day he has had many accolades and many chances to do whatever he wished with his life.
Obama	0	He has been an advisor to four U.S. Presidents, served on a commission to the Vatican, and as President of the United Negro College Fund.
Obama	0	But through all of this, he decided to stay here in New Orleans, and build this university.
Obama	0	And so when Katrina tried to tear it down, you can understand why he refused to let that happen - why he put aside tending to the damage in his own house so that he could work on rebuilding this one - why he believed more than anything in his promise that these doors would open in January.
Obama	0	Norman Francis has helped make today's miracle because he has seen miracles at work in his own life.
Obama	0	Now that you have seen one in yours, it's your turn to live a life committed to others, devoted to the impossible, and ever aware of the lessons you learned in New Orleans.
Obama	0	I've noticed that in the rebuilding effort throughout this city, one of the last things to come back, and yet the easiest to notice, is the greenery that makes any community seem alive.
Obama	0	And as I saw a newly planted tree on my last trip here, I thought of a passage from the book of Job: "There is hope for a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again, and that its tender branch will not cease."
Obama	0	Katrina was not the end of the tough times for New Orleans, and you will continue to face your own tests and challenges in the years to come.
Obama	0	But if someone were to ask me how the tree stands on this August day, I would tell them that the seeds have sprouted, the roots are strong, and I just saw more than 500 branches that are ready to grow again.
Obama	0	Congratulations on your graduation.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	AFSCME National Convention - Challenge for Labor  TOPIC: Economy & Labor August 7, 2006 AFSCME National Convention Complete Text Thank you, and welcome to Chicago.
Obama	0	We meet here at a challenging time for labor and a challenging time for America.
Obama	0	All across the country, from nurses in Chicago to correctional officers in Atlanta to sanitation workers in L.A., Americans have been looking to the future with more anxiety than hope.
Obama	0	As transformations in technology and communication have ushered in a global economy with new rules and new risks, they've watched their government do its best to try and shift those risks onto the backs of the American worker.
Obama	0	And they wonder how they will ever keep up.
Obama	0	In coffee shops and town meetings, in VFW halls and right here in this room, the questions are all the same.
Obama	0	Will I be able to leave my children a better world than I was given?
Obama	0	Will I be able to save enough to send them to college or plan for a secure retirement?
Obama	0	Will my job even be there tomorrow?
Obama	0	Who will stand up for me in this new world?
Obama	0	In this time of change and uncertainty, these questions are expected - but I want you to know today they are by no means unique.
Obama	0	Throughout our history, they have been asked and then answered by Americans who have stood in your shoes and shared your concerns.
Obama	0	In the middle of the last century, on the restless streets of Memphis, it was a group of AFSCME sanitation workers who took up this charge.
Obama	0	For years they had served their city without complaint, picking up other people's trash for little pay and even less respect.
Obama	0	Passers-by would call them "walking buzzards," and in the segregated South, most were forced to use separate drinking fountains and bathrooms.
Obama	0	But as the civil rights movement gained steam and they watched the marches and saw the boycotts and heard about the passage of voting rights, the workers in Memphis decided that they'd had enough, and in 1968, over 1,000 went on strike.
Obama	0	Their demands were simple.
Obama	0	Recognition of their union.
Obama	0	The right to bargain.
Obama	0	A few cents more an hour.
Obama	0	But the opposition was fierce.
Obama	0	Their vigils were met with handcuffs.
Obama	0	Their protests turned back with mace.
Obama	0	One march was interrupted by police gunfire and tear gas, and when the smoke cleared, 280 had been arrested, 60 were wounded, and one 16-year old boy lay dead.
Obama	0	And still, the city would not give in.
Obama	0	Now, the workers could have gone home, or they could've gone back to work, or they could've waited for someone else to help them, but they didn't.
Obama	0	They kept marching.
Obama	0	They drew ministers and high school students and civil rights activists to their cause, and at the beginning of the third straight month, Dr. King himself came down to Memphis.
Obama	0	At this point, the story of the sanitation workers merges with the larger saga of the Civil Rights Movement.
Obama	0	On April 3rd, we know that King gave his "I've Been to the Mountaintop" sermon.
Obama	0	On April 4th, he was shot and killed by James Earl Ray as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine hotel.
Obama	0	And on April 8th, a day before he was buried, his wife Coretta led the sanitation workers on one final march through the city of Memphis - a march that would culminate in the union contract that the workers had sought for so long.
Obama	0	This is the legacy you inherit today.
Obama	0	It's a legacy of courage, a legacy of action, a legacy of achieving the greatest triumphs amidst the greatest odds.
Obama	0	It's a story as American as any - that at the edge of despair, in the shadow of hopelessness, ordinary people make the extraordinary decision that if we stand together, we rise together.
Obama	0	What those workers made real in Memphis - and what we have to make real today - is the idea that in this country, we value the labor of every American.
Obama	0	That we're willing to respect that labor and reward it with a few basic guarantees - wages that can raise a family, health care if we get sick, a retirement that's dignified, working conditions that are safe.
Obama	0	The struggle to secure these guarantees has always been at the heart of the labor movement - and the opposition has always been powerful.
Obama	0	But today, we're facing a challenge like none we've seen before.
Obama	0	At the very moment that globalization is changing the rules of the game on the American worker - making it harder to compete with cheaper, highly-skilled workers all over the world - the people running Washington are responding with a philosophy that says government has no role in solving these problems; that the services you all provide every day are better left to the whims of the private sector.
Obama	0	They're telling us we're better off if we dismantle government - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...
Obama	0	It's called the Ownership Society in Washington.
Obama	0	But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
Obama	0	It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
Obama	0	It's a bracing idea.
Obama	0	It's a tempting idea.
Obama	0	And it's the easiest thing in the world.
Obama	0	But there's just one problem.
Obama	0	It doesn't work.
Obama	0	It ignores our history.
Obama	0	It ignores the fact that it has been government research and investment that made the railways and the internet possible.
Obama	0	It has been the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefits and public schools - that has allowed all of us to prosper.
Obama	0	And it has been the ability of working men and women to join together in unions that has allowed our rising tide to lift every boat.
Obama	0	Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.
Obama	0	But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility.
Obama	0	The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
Obama	0	Americans know this.
Obama	0	We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
Obama	0	But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own.
Obama	0	We know that there are some things we do better together.
Obama	0	We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
Obama	0	That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.
Obama	0	That's what America is.
Obama	0	That's what those workers in Memphis fought for.
Obama	0	And that's what we fight for today.
Obama	0	Some of what we need to do is clear.
Obama	0	When you have a Republican Congress that says "no" to organizing rights, "no" to overtime pay, "no" to a higher minimum wage, "no" to Social Security, and "no" to Medicaid, it's time to say "no" to that Congress and put Democrats in charge come November.
Obama	0	But if we really want to lead - if we really hope to convince the country that our vision of government is better than theirs - we're gonna need more than just "no."
Obama	0	We're gonna need to tell the country what our plan is for the 21st century worker - what we'll do to give every American the chance to get ahead and raise their family.
Obama	0	I won't stand up here and say that coming up with this strategy will be easy, or pretend to know all the answers.
Obama	0	But there's a few places we can start.
Obama	0	We can start by fixing our schools to make sure every child in America has the education and the skills they need to compete.
Obama	0	We can start by making sure that college is affordable for every American who wants to go.
Obama	0	And by giving unions a real role in creating a real system of lifelong learning so that workers who lose a job really can retrain for other high-wage jobs.
Obama	0	In this new economy, we can start giving our workers a chance by making sure that no matter where you work or how many times you switch jobs, you will have health care and a pension you can take with you always.
Obama	0	We'll never rise together if we allow medical bills to swallow family budgets or let people retire penniless after a lifetime of hard work, and so we can start by demanding that when it comes to commitments made to working men and women on health care and pensions, a promise made is a promise kept.
Obama	0	And in a world where two-income households are trying to juggle work and family, we can start giving workers a chance with policies that give families a chance.
Obama	0	When a parent takes parental leave, we shouldn't act like caring for a newborn baby is a three-month break - we should let them keep their salary.
Obama	0	When parents are working and their children need care, we should make sure that care is affordable, and that our kids can go to school earlier and longer so they have a safe place to learn while their parents are at work.
Obama	0	And when a mom or a dad has to leave work to care for a sick child, we should make sure it doesn't result in a pink slip.
Obama	0	Our vision of America is not one where a big government runs our lives; it's one that gives every American the opportunity to make the most of their lives.
Obama	0	It's not one that tells us we're on our own, it's one that realizes that we rise or fall together as one people.
Obama	0	And yet, we also know that, in the end, neither policy nor politics can replace heart and courage in the struggle you now face.
Obama	0	Because in the brief history of the American experiment, it has been the ability of ordinary Americans to act on both that has allowed our nation to achieve extraordinary things.
Obama	0	Nearly forty years ago, the strike in Memphis came to an end.
Obama	0	But today, the march goes on.
Obama	0	Every year, on April 4th, the sanitation workers of Local 1733 gather again to march the route that led them to justice so long ago.
Obama	0	Sometimes they walk the whole way, other years a bus comes to carry them the last few miles.
Obama	0	They march to remember, but they also march because they know our journey isn't complete - they know we have fights left to win; that we have dreams still unfulfilled.
Obama	0	A few years back, one of these workers, a man named Malcolm Pryor, told a reporter, "You have to remind people: We are not free yet.
Obama	0	As long as I march, Dr. King's soul is still rejoicing that people are still trying."
Obama	0	And so today I ask you to keep marching.
Obama	0	As long as there are those who are jobless, I ask you to keep marching for jobs.
Obama	0	As long as there are those who struggle to raise a family on low wages and few benefits, I ask you to keep marching for opportunity.
Obama	0	As long as there are those who can't organize or unionize or bargain for a better life, I ask you to keep marching for solidarity.
Obama	0	And as long as there are those who try to privatize our government and decimate our social programs and peddle a philosophy of trickle-down and on-your-own, I ask you to keep marching for a vision of America where we rise or fall as one nation under God.
Obama	0	My friends, it's time again to march for freedom.
Obama	0	Time again to march for hope.
Obama	0	Time again to march towards the tomorrow that so many have reached for so many times in our past.
Obama	0	I know we can get there, and I can't wait to try.
Obama	0	Thank you, and good luck.
Obama	0	Vote against the Gulf of Mexico Energy Bill  TOPIC: Oil & Alternative Fuels August 1, 2006 Statement of Senator Barack Obama Vote against the Gulf of Mexico Energy Bill Complete Text Every one of us in Congress has heard from our constituents about the high cost of gas.
Obama	0	A gallon is now $3 or more in most parts of the country, and there is every reason to believe that figure will continue to climb throughout the rest of the summer.
Obama	0	Americans are asking their members of Congress to help lower some of these costs.
Obama	0	And we should do that.
Obama	0	But let's not kid ourselves.
Obama	0	This is a problem that was decades in the making, and short-term political solutions - whether it's a tax rebate or more legislation to stop price gouging - aren't going to be the complete answer.
Obama	0	To be sure, most of these proposals would do no harm, and many would provide Americans some temporary relief at the pump.
Obama	0	But in the long term, we can't rely solely on quick fixes designed to placate an anxious public.
Obama	0	We need solutions designed to permanently lessen our dependence on foreign oil.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, both Congress and the White House have been unwilling to take the politically difficult steps necessary to confront one of the most pressing economic and national security challenges of the 21st century.
Obama	0	A perfect example is the bill before us.
Obama	0	It does do some good things: it marginally increases the supply of oil, and it provides a financial boost to Gulf Coast states that could use the help.
Obama	0	But fundamentally, the bill only focuses on part of the problem - our inadequate supply of oil.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, increasing supply can't be our only answer.
Obama	0	Even if we opened up every square inch of this country for drilling, America only has 3% of the world's oil reserves.
Obama	0	With our own Energy Department telling us that our demand for oil will jump 40% over the next 20 years and countries like China and India adding millions of cars to their roads, this means that if we truly hope to solve this problem, we must focus on reducing demand.
Obama	0	Members on both sides of the aisle have suggested some innovative ways to do this.
Obama	0	Senator Lugar and I introduced the America Fuels Act to increase the production of homegrown biofuels.
Obama	0	And Senator Bunning and I have worked on a bill to produce liquid fuels from coal.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, we're not going to have a debate this week on how to reduce the demand for oil, because we weren't allowed to add any amendments to this bill that would focus on that problem.
Obama	0	Because contrary to the judgment of every credible person who has examined our nation's energy woes, the Republican leadership in the Senate believes we can solve our energy problems by just drilling more.
Obama	0	That's not only dishonest -- it's a disservice to our constituents who want us to work together to solve this crisis.
Obama	0	I'd like to spend a few minutes today discussing two of the proposals that should have been part of this energy debate - two proposals that could have made this bill worthwhile.
Obama	0	First, we need to start producing cars that use less oil.
Obama	0	Thirty-three years ago, this nation faced an energy crisis that affected every American.
Obama	0	In the shadow of a war against Israel, the Arab nations of OPEC chose to embargo shipments of crude oil to the West.
Obama	0	The shocks were felt in national economies worldwide.
Obama	0	Washington lawmakers responded by creating daylight savings time and a national speed limit.
Obama	0	A new Department of Energy and a Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established.
Obama	0	And Congress enacted Corporate Average Fuel Economy - or CAFE - standards, the first-ever requirements to reduce petroleum consumption in the vehicles we drive.
Obama	0	As a result, the gas mileage of cars doubled from 14 miles per gallon in 1976 to 27.5 mpg for cars in 1985.
Obama	0	Today, CAFE saves us about 3 million barrels of oil per day, making it among the most successful energy-saving measures ever adopted.
Obama	0	But that decade's worth of fuel consumption improvements ended more than 20 years ago, because CAFE standards are the same today as they were in 1985 - 27.5 mpg for cars.
Obama	0	To address this problem, I have joined with Senator Lugar and a bipartisan coalition of senators to propose the Fuel Economy Reform Act, which we have also filed as an amendment to the OCS bill.
Obama	0	This amendment would establish regular, continual, and incremental progress in fuel economy, but still preserve the expertise and flexibility of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - or NHTSA - to determine how to meet those targets.
Obama	0	Under this proposal, CAFE standards would increase by 4 percent every year unless NHTSA can justify a deviation in that rate by proving that the increase is either technologically unachievable, would materially reduce the safety of automobiles, or is not cost-effective.
Obama	0	For too long, the presumption has been that the public would have to prove to the auto industry why it should raise fuel economy standards.
Obama	0	This proposal would flip that presumption by asking the auto industry to prove why it can't raise those standards.
Obama	0	Under this system, if the 4 percent annualized improvement occurs for ten years, we would save 1.3 million barrels of oil per day - an astounding 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year.
Obama	0	If gasoline is just $2.50 per gallon, consumers would save $50 billion at the pump in 2018.
Obama	0	By 2018, we would be cutting global warming pollution by 220 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases.
Obama	0	And yet, auto executives are right when they say that transitioning to more fuel-efficient automobiles would be costly at a time of sagging profits and stiff competition, and that's precisely why the federal government shouldn't let the industry face these challenges on their own.
Obama	0	The Fuel Economy Act provides tax incentives to retool parts and assembly plants.
Obama	0	But we should do more than that.
Obama	0	We need to help the Big Three automakers with one of their largest expenses, namely, retiree health care costs, which ran almost $6.7 billion just last year.
Obama	0	For GM, these health care costs represent $1,500 of the price of every GM car that's made, which is more than what they pay for the steel.
Obama	0	To that end, I also have filed an amendment to this bill based on the Health Care for Hybrids Act that I introduced last year.
Obama	0	That proposal would set up a voluntary program in which automakers could choose to receive federal financial assistance towards their retiree healthcare costs.
Obama	0	In return, the automakers would be required to reinvest these savings into developing fuel-efficient vehicles.
Obama	0	With the American consumer demanding more hybrid vehicles - and that demand currently being filled by foreign automakers - this proposal could jumpstart the Big Three to commercialize new technology.
Obama	0	More American hybrid cars also ensure that there is competition in this growing market, and would help keep car prices affordable.
Obama	0	If we had adopted these two proposals decades ago, when the call for energy independence was first issued in this country, today we wouldn't be nearly as beholden to the whims of oil-rich dictators and surging gas prices.
Obama	0	And if we don't take these steps now, we will someday look back on today's $3 per gallon gasoline as the good old days.
Obama	0	At that point, no amount of drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf will solve our problems.
Obama	0	We could have taken these common-sense steps now to reduce the demand for oil.
Obama	0	We have the need, we have the technology, we have the resources - but with this bill, we refused to find the political will to get it done.
Obama	0	We still owe it to the American public to find that will.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, this bill sends the wrong message.
Obama	0	Instead of making tough political decisions about how to reduce our insatiable demand for oil, this bill continues to lull the American people into thinking that we can drill our way out of our energy problems.
Obama	0	We can't, and for that reason, I plan to vote against this bill.
Obama	0	In Support of HR 9 - the Voting Rights Act  TOPIC: Civil Rights July 20, 2006 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama In Support of H.R.
Obama	0	9, the Voting Rights Act Complete Text Mr. President, I rise today, both humbled and honored by the opportunity to express my support for renewal of the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Obama	0	I want to thank the many people inside and outside of Congress who worked so hard over the past year to get us here.
Obama	0	We owe a debt of gratitude to the leadership on both sides of the aisle, and we owe special thanks to Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Specter, Ranking Members Conyers and Leahy, and Rep. Mel Watt.
Obama	0	Without their work and dedication - and the support of voting rights advocates around the country - I doubt this bill would have come before us so soon.
Obama	0	And I want to thank both chambers, and both sides of the aisle, for getting this done with the same broad support that drove the original Act 40 years ago.
Obama	0	At a time when Americans are frustrated with the partisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing display of bipartisanship we are seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success of the Act and reminds us of how effective we can be when we work together.
Obama	0	Nobody can deny that we've come a long way since 1965.
Obama	0	Look at registration numbers.
Obama	0	Only two years after passage of the original Act, registration numbers for minority voters in some states doubled.
Obama	0	Soon after, not a single state covered by the Voting Rights Act had registered less than half of its minority voting-age population.
Obama	0	Look at the influence of African-American elected officials at all levels of government.
Obama	0	There are African-American members of Congress.
Obama	0	Since 2001, our nation's top diplomat has been an African-American.
Obama	0	In fact, most of America's elected African-American officials come from the states covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act - states like Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana and Georgia.
Obama	0	But to me, the most striking evidence of our progress can be found right across this building, in my dear friend, Congressman John Lewis, who was on the front lines of the civil rights movement, risking life and limb for freedom.
Obama	0	And on March 7, 1965, he led 600 peaceful protestors demanding the right to vote across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.
Obama	0	I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day.
Obama	0	Not only John Lewis and Hosea Williams leading the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it.
Obama	0	Blacks and whites, teenagers and children, teachers and bankers and shopkeepers - a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom.
Obama	0	And I wonder, where did they find that kind of courage?
Obama	0	When you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gas...when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the Lord for salvation?
Obama	0	But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day - after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them...after all that, they went back to march again.
Obama	0	They marched again.
Obama	0	They crossed the bridge.
Obama	0	They awakened a nation's conscience, and not five months later, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law.
Obama	0	And it was reauthorized in 1970, 1975, and 1982.
Obama	0	Now, in 2006, John Lewis, the physical scars from those marches still visible, is an original cosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, and he was joined last week by 389 of his House colleagues in voting for its passage.
Obama	0	There are some who argue the Act is no longer needed, that the protections of Section 5's "pre-clearance" requirement - a requirement that ensures certain states are upholding the right to vote - are targeting the wrong states.
Obama	0	But the evidence refutes that notion.
Obama	0	Of the 1,100 objections issued by the Department of Justice since 1965, 56% occurred since the last reauthorization in 1982.
Obama	0	So, despite the progress these states have made in upholding the right to vote, it's clear that problems still exist.
Obama	0	Others have argued against renewing Section 203's protection of language minorities.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, these arguments have been tied to the debate over immigration and muddle a non-controversial issue - protecting the right to vote - with one of today's most contentious debates.
Obama	0	But let's remember: you can't request language assistance if you're not a voter, and you can't be a voter if you're not a citizen.
Obama	0	And while voters, as citizens, must be proficient in English, many are simply more confident that they can cast ballots printed in their native languages without making errors.
Obama	0	A representative of the Southwestern Voter Registration Project is quoted as saying: "Citizens who prefer Spanish registration cards do so because they feel more connected to the process; they also feel they trust the process more when they understand it."
Obama	0	These sentiments - connection to and trust in our democratic process - are exactly what we want from our voting rights legislation.
Obama	0	Our challenges don't end at reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act either.
Obama	0	We have to prevent the problems we've seen in recent elections from happening again.
Obama	0	We've seen political operatives purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, prevent eligible ex-felons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and deceive voters about the time, location and rules of elections.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, these efforts have been directed primarily at minorities, the disabled, low-income individuals, and other historically disenfranchised groups.
Obama	0	The Help America Vote Act was a big step in the right direction, but we need to do more.
Obama	0	We need to fully fund HAVA.
Obama	0	We need to enforce critical requirements like statewide registration databases.
Obama	0	We need to make sure polling equipment is distributed equitably and that the equipment works.
Obama	0	And we need to work on getting more people to the polls on election day.
Obama	0	We need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of deplorable intimidation tactics when they do get to the polls.
Obama	0	In 2004, Native American voters in South Dakota were confronted by men posing as law enforcement.
Obama	0	These hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps, and followed voters to their cars to record their license plate numbers.
Obama	0	In Lake County, Ohio, some voters received a memo on bogus Board of Elections letterhead informing voters who registered through Democratic and NAACP drives that they could not vote.
Obama	0	In Wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the "Milwaukee Black Voters League" was circulated in predominantly African-American neighborhoods with the following message: "If you've already voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election.
Obama	0	If you violate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get taken away from you."
Obama	0	So, we have much more work to do.
Obama	0	This occasion is cause for celebration, but it's also an opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights.
Obama	0	As Congressman Lewis said last week: "It's clear that we have come a great distance, but we still have a great distance to go."
Obama	0	The memory of Selma still lives on in the spirit of the Voting Rights Act.
Obama	0	Since that day, the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in ensuring that all Americans not only have the right to vote, but the right to have their vote counted.
Obama	0	Those of us concerned about protecting those rights can't afford to sit on our laurels upon reauthorization of this bill.
Obama	0	We must take advantage of this rare united front and continue the fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls for all Americans.
Obama	0	In other words, we need to take the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this country.
Obama	0	Two weeks after the first march was turned back, Dr. King told a gathering of organizers and activists and community members that they should not despair because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.
Obama	0	That's because of the work that each of us do to bend it towards justice.
Obama	0	It's because of people like John Lewis and Fannie Lou Hamer and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks, all the giants upon whose shoulders we stand that we are the beneficiaries of that arc bending towards justice.
Obama	0	That's why I stand here today.
Obama	0	I would not be in the United States Senate had it not been for the efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents and ordinary people who were willing to reach up and bend that arc in the direction of justice.
Obama	0	I hope we continue to see that spirit live on, not just during this debate, but throughout all our work here in the Senate.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Floor Statement of Support for Stem Cell Research  TOPIC: Healthcare & Health Issues July 17, 2006 Statement of Support for Stem Cell Research Complete Text Mr. President, a few weeks ago I was visited by two of my constituents-- Mary Schneider and her son Ryan.
Obama	0	When Ryan was just two years old, his parents and doctors noted severe delays in his motor and speech development, and he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.
Obama	0	His parents were devastated, as the prognosis for many children with cerebral palsy is quite grim, and given the severity of Ryan's condition, his doctors didn't have much hope for his improvement.
Obama	0	Yet, his parents had hope.
Obama	0	Because when Ryan was born, his parents had saved his cord blood, a viable but limited source of stem cells.
Obama	0	They found a doctor at Duke University who was willing to perform an experimental infusion with these cells to see if they might improve his condition.
Obama	0	They did.
Obama	0	In fact, they seem to have cured him.
Obama	0	Within months of the infusion, Ryan was able to speak, use his arms, and eat normally, just like any other child - a miracle his family had once only dreamed of.
Obama	0	Ryan's story exemplifies the power and the promise of stem cells to treat and cure the millions of Americans who are suffering from catastrophic, debilitating and life-threatening diseases and health conditions.
Obama	0	Each year, 100,000 Americans will develop Alzheimer's disease.
Obama	0	Over 1 million adults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year, which can lead to complications such as blindness, damaged nerves and loss of kidney function.
Obama	0	And there are far too many individuals with spinal cord injuries who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence.
Obama	0	For most of our history, medicine has offered little hope of recovery to individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and injuries.
Obama	0	Until now.
Obama	0	Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to improved treatments, if not cures, for those affected by Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury and countless other conditions.
Obama	0	Many men, women and children who are cancer survivors are already familiar with the life-saving applications of adult stem cell research.
Obama	0	Patients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow transplants, a type of stem cell transplant, which can significantly prolong life, or permanently get rid of the cancer.
Obama	0	This therapy has been used successfully for decades, and is saving lives everyday.
Obama	0	Yet this breakthrough has its serious limitations.
Obama	0	Adult stem cells, such as those used in bone marrow transplants, can only be collected in small quantities, may not be a match for the patient, and have limited ability to transform into specialized cells.
Obama	0	Cord blood, like the kind Ryan used, has limitations as well.
Obama	0	If, for example, young Ryan's condition should deteriorate or he should develop another illness, there simply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use.
Obama	0	His mother has told us that the few remaining cells would have to be cloned to get enough cells for future use, or they would have to obtain stem cells from another source.
Obama	0	These and other difficulties are the reasons why scientists have started to explore other types and other sources for stem cells, including embryonic stem cell research.
Obama	0	Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including in vitro fertilization.
Obama	0	At this very moment, there are over 400,000 embryos being stored in over 400 facilities throughout the United States.
Obama	0	The majority of these are reserved for infertile couples.
Obama	0	However, many of these embryos will go unused, destined for permanent storage in a freezer or disposal.
Obama	0	We should expand and accelerate research using these embryos, just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult stem cell use and cord blood use.
Obama	0	All over the country, exciting progress is being made in the area of embryonic stem cell research.
Obama	0	At the University of Illinois, they're finding that stem cells have the potential to treat blood disorders, lung diseases, and heart damage.
Obama	0	At Johns Hopkins, researchers were able to use mouse embryonic stem cells to repair damaged nerves and restore mobility in paralyzed rats.
Obama	0	One can't help but think that it's a matter of when, not if, this research will be able to one day help those who have lost the ability to walk.
Obama	0	For these reasons, I'm proud to be a long-term supporter of greater stem cell research.
Obama	0	While I was a member of the Illinois Senate, I was the chief cosponsor of the Ronald Reagan Biomedical Research Act, which would specifically permit embryonic stem cell research in Illinois, and establish review of this research by the Illinois Department of Public Health.
Obama	0	And I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the stem cell bill before us today.
Obama	0	This bill embodies the innovative thinking that we as a society demand and medical advancement requires.
Obama	0	By expanding scientific access to embryonic stem cells which would be otherwise discarded, this bill will help our nation's scientists and researchers develop treatments and cures to help people who suffer from illnesses and injuries for which there are currently none.
Obama	0	But the bill is not without limits; it requires that scientific research also be subject to rigorous oversight.
Obama	0	I realize there are moral and ethical issues surrounding this debate.
Obama	0	But I also realize that we're not talking about harvesting cells that would've been used to create life and we're not talking about cloning humans.
Obama	0	We're talking about using stem cells that would have otherwise been discarded and lost forever - and we're talking about using those stem cells to possibly save the lives of millions of Americans.
Obama	0	Democrats want this bill to pass.
Obama	0	Conservative, pro-life Republicans want this bill to pass.
Obama	0	By large margins, the American people want this bill to pass.
Obama	0	It is only the White House standing in the way of progress - standing in the way of so many potential cures.
Obama	0	I would only ask that the President thinks about this before he picks up his pen to deliver his first veto in six years.
Obama	0	I would ask that he thinks about Ryan Schneider and his parents, and all the other families who are sitting and waiting and praying for a cure - hoping that somewhere, a researcher or scientist will find the answer.
Obama	0	There was a time in the middle of the last century when America watched helplessly as a mysterious disease left thousands - especially children - disabled for life.
Obama	0	The medical community worked tirelessly to try and find a cure, but they needed help - they needed funding to make their research possible.
Obama	0	With a world war raging and the country still emerging from depression, the federal government could have ignored their plight or told them to find a cure on their own.
Obama	0	But that didn't happen.
Obama	0	Instead, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped galvanize a community of compassion and organize the March of Dimes to find the cure for polio.
Obama	0	And while Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the discovery of a vaccine, he also knew that at its best, government can be used as a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on our own.
Obama	0	And so the people began to care and the dimes piled up and the funding started to flow, and fifty years ago, Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine.
Obama	0	Americans are looking for that kind of leadership today.
Obama	0	All over the country, patients and their families are waiting today for Congress and the President to open the door to the cures of tomorrow.
Obama	0	At the dawn of the 21st century, we should approach this research with the same passion and commitment that have led to so many cures and saved so many lives throughout our history.
Obama	0	I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Campus Progress Annual Conference  TOPIC: Our Past, Our Future & Vision for America July 12, 2006 Campus Progress Annual Conference Complete Text I want to congratulate all of you at Campus Progress for the work you've been doing to build a new generation of progressive leadership in this country.
Obama	0	At a time when too many in the media have written off your generation as apathetic or uninvolved, you're proving not only that you care very deeply about the future of this country, but that you're willing to do something about it.
Obama	0	I could stand up here today and talk about that future - about our vision for America - but I know that we share similar views on this and that you're pretty well-versed on the issues anyway.
Obama	0	So instead I'd like to talk a bit about what comes next for all of you - what happens after you leave the confines of college and head out into the real world.
Obama	0	It's a scary thought, I know, but I also remember that by the end of my four years in college, I may have had a vague idea that I wanted to go into community organizing, but no clue how I would go about doing that or whether it was even the right choice for me.
Obama	0	I have a feeling that many of you might be in a similar boat when it comes to politics and organizing and activism after college, and so today I'd just like to offer you a few pieces of advice that might be able to help you on your way.
Obama	0	The first is to take risks.
Obama	0	When I told people that after college, I planned on being a community organizer and working in low-income neighborhoods, they thought I was crazy.
Obama	0	My mother and grandparents thought I should go to law school.
Obama	0	My friends had applied for jobs on Wall Street.
Obama	0	But I went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that I could think of.
Obama	0	And finally, this small group of churches on the south side of Chicago wrote back and gave me a job organizing neighborhoods devastated by steel-plant closings in the early 80s.
Obama	0	The churches didn't have much money - so they offered me a grand sum of $12,000 a year plus $1,000 to buy a car.
Obama	0	And I got ready to move to Chicago - a place I had never been and where I didn't know a living soul.
Obama	0	Even people who didn't know me were skeptical of my decision.
Obama	0	I remember having a conversation with an older man I had met before I arrived in Chicago.
Obama	0	I told him about my plans, and he looked at me and said, "Let me tell something.
Obama	0	You look like a nice clean-cut young man, and you've got a nice voice.
Obama	0	So let me give you a piece of advice - forget this community organizing business.
Obama	0	You can't change the world, and people won't appreciate you trying.
Obama	0	What you should do is go into television broadcasting.
Obama	0	I'm telling you, you've got a future."
Obama	0	I could've taken my mother's advice and I could've taken my grandparents advice.
Obama	0	I could've taken the path my friends traveled.
Obama	0	And objectively speaking, that TV thing might have made some sense.
Obama	0	But I knew there was something in me that wanted to try for something bigger.
Obama	0	And so I went.
Obama	0	This is harder than it sounds - and it will be for all of you.
Obama	0	With all the work you've done and the organizations you've been involved in, you'll have boundless opportunities when you graduate.
Obama	0	And it's very easy to just take that diploma, forget about all this progressive politics stuff, and go chasing after the big house and the large salary and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should buy.
Obama	0	But I hope you don't.
Obama	0	Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition.
Obama	0	It asks too little of yourself.
Obama	0	And it will leave you unfulfilled.
Obama	0	So don't let people talk you into doing the safe thing.
Obama	0	Listen to what's inside of you and decide what it is that you care about so much that you're willing to risk it all.
Obama	0	The next piece of advice comes from a lesson that I learned once I got to Chicago.
Obama	0	I had spent weeks organizing our very first community meeting around the issue of gang violence.
Obama	0	We invited the police; we made phone calls, went to churches, and passed out flyers.
Obama	0	I had been warned of the turf battles and bad politics between certain community leaders, but I ignored them, confident that I knew what I was doing.
Obama	0	The night of the meeting we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of the crowd.
Obama	0	And we waited.
Obama	0	And we waited.
Obama	0	And finally, a group of older people walk in to the hall.
Obama	0	And they sit down.
Obama	0	And this little old lady raises her hand and asks, "Is this where the bingo game is?"
Obama	0	Thirteen people showed up that night.
Obama	0	The police never came.
Obama	0	And the meeting was a complete disaster.
Obama	0	Later, the volunteers I worked with told me they were quitting - that they had been doing this for two years and had nothing to show for it.
Obama	0	I was tired too.
Obama	0	But at that point, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street, tossing stones at boarded-up apartment building.
Obama	0	And I turned to the volunteers, and I asked them, "Before you quit, I want you to answer one question.
Obama	0	What's gonna happen to those boys?
Obama	0	Who will fight for them if not us?
Obama	0	Who will give them a fair shot if we leave?"
Obama	0	And at that moment, we were all reminded of an important lesson: Persevere.
Obama	0	Making your mark on the world is hard.
Obama	0	If it were easy, everybody would do it.
Obama	0	But it's not.
Obama	0	It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way.
Obama	0	The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't.
Obama	0	it's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere.
Obama	0	After my little speech that day, one by one, the volunteers decided not to quit.
Obama	0	We went back to those neighborhoods, and we kept at it, sustaining ourselves with the small victories.
Obama	0	And over time, a community changed.
Obama	0	And so had we.
Obama	0	The last piece of advice is to cultivate a sense of empathy.
Obama	0	There's a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit.
Obama	0	But I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit - the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes; to see the world through those who are different from us - the child who's hungry, the laid-off steelworker, the immigrant woman cleaning your dorm room.
Obama	0	The fact that you're here and participating in Campus Progress means that most of you have already done this better than most ever will.
Obama	0	But as you go on in life, cultivating this quality of empathy will become harder, not easier.
Obama	0	There's no community service requirement in the real world; no one forcing you to care.
Obama	0	You'll be free to live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the same schools, and narrow your concerns to what's going in your own little circle.
Obama	0	Not only that - we live in a culture that discourages empathy.
Obama	0	A culture that too often tells us our principle goal in life is to be rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained.
Obama	0	A culture where those in power too often encourage these selfish impulses.
Obama	0	They will tell you that the Americans who sleep in the streets and beg for food got there because they're all lazy or weak of spirit.
Obama	0	That the inner-city children who are trapped in dilapidated schools can't learn and won't learn and so we should just give up on them entirely.
Obama	0	That the innocent people being slaughtered and expelled from their homes half a world away are somebody else's problem to take care of.
Obama	0	I hope you don't listen to this.
Obama	0	I hope you choose to broaden, and not contract, your ambit of concern.
Obama	0	Not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation.
Obama	0	Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.
Obama	0	It's because you have an obligation to yourself.
Obama	0	Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation.
Obama	0	And because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential - and become full-grown.
Obama	0	As I think about all of the good each of you has the potential to do in this world, I'm reminded of this image.
Obama	0	It's the image of young Americans - teenagers and college kids not much older than you - from all over the country, watching the Civil Rights Movement unfold before them on their television sets.
Obama	0	I imagine that they would've seen the marchers and heard the speeches, but they also probably saw the dogs and the fire hoses, or the footage of innocent people being beaten within an inch of their lives, or maybe they would've heard the news the day those four little girls died when someone threw a bomb into their church.
Obama	0	Instinctively, they knew that it was safer and smarter to stay at home; to watch the movement from afar.
Obama	0	But somewhere in their hearts, they also understood that these people in Georgia and Alabama and Mississippi were their brothers and sisters; that what was happening was wrong; and that they had an obligation to make it right.
Obama	0	And so when the buses pulled up for a Freedom Ride down South, they got on.
Obama	0	And they rode.
Obama	0	Thousands of them.
Obama	0	And they changed the world.
Obama	0	We need you to do the same.
Obama	0	As Robert F. Kennedy once told a crowd of South Africans no older than you, "The world demands the qualities of youth; not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease."
Obama	0	Today, I want thank each of you for demonstrating these qualities through your service to the people of this nation, and I wish all of you a future that is hopeful, dedicated, and ever youthful.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	“Call to Renewal” Keynote Address   Call to Renewal Pt 1   Call to Renewal Part 2     TOPIC: Our Past, Our Future & Vision for America June 28, 2006 “Call to Renewal' Keynote Address” Complete Text Good morning.
Obama	0	I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Call to Renewal's Building a Covenant for a New America conference.
Obama	0	I've had the opportunity to take a look at your Covenant for a New America.
Obama	0	It is filled with outstanding policies and prescriptions for much of what ails this country.
Obama	0	So I'd like to congratulate you all on the thoughtful presentations you've given so far about poverty and justice in America, and for putting fire under the feet of the political leadership here in Washington.
Obama	0	But today I'd like to talk about the connection between religion and politics and perhaps offer some thoughts about how we can sort through some of the often bitter arguments that we've been seeing over the last several years.
Obama	0	I do so because, as you all know, we can affirm the importance of poverty in the Bible; and we can raise up and pass out this Covenant for a New America.
Obama	0	We can talk to the press, and we can discuss the religious call to address poverty and environmental stewardship all we want, but it won't have an impact unless we tackle head-on the mutual suspicion that sometimes exists between religious America and secular America.
Obama	0	I want to give you an example that I think illustrates this fact.
Obama	0	As some of you know, during the 2004 U.S. Senate General Election I ran against a gentleman named Alan Keyes.
Obama	0	Mr. Keyes is well-versed in the Jerry Falwell-Pat Robertson style of rhetoric that often labels progressives as both immoral and godless.
Obama	0	Indeed, Mr. Keyes announced towards the end of the campaign that, "Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama.
Obama	0	Christ would not vote for Barack Obama because Barack Obama has behaved in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved."
Obama	0	Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama.
Obama	0	Now, I was urged by some of my liberal supporters not to take this statement seriously, to essentially ignore it.
Obama	0	To them, Mr. Keyes was an extremist, and his arguments not worth entertaining.
Obama	0	And since at the time, I was up 40 points in the polls, it probably wasn't a bad piece of strategic advice.
Obama	0	But what they didn't understand, however, was that I had to take Mr. Keyes seriously, for he claimed to speak for my religion, and my God.
Obama	0	He claimed knowledge of certain truths.
Obama	0	Mr. Obama says he's a Christian, he was saying, and yet he supports a lifestyle that the Bible calls an abomination.
Obama	0	Mr. Obama says he's a Christian, but supports the destruction of innocent and sacred life.
Obama	0	And so what would my supporters have me say?
Obama	0	How should I respond?
Obama	0	Should I say that a literalist reading of the Bible was folly?
Obama	0	Should I say that Mr. Keyes, who is a Roman Catholic, should ignore the teachings of the Pope?
Obama	0	Unwilling to go there, I answered with what has come to be the typically liberal response in such debates - namely, I said that we live in a pluralistic society, that I can't impose my own religious views on another, that I was running to be the U.S.
Obama	0	Senator of Illinois and not the Minister of Illinois.
Obama	0	But Mr. Keyes's implicit accusation that I was not a true Christian nagged at me, and I was also aware that my answer did not adequately address the role my faith has in guiding my own values and my own beliefs.
Obama	0	Now, my dilemma was by no means unique.
Obama	0	In a way, it reflected the broader debate we've been having in this country for the last thirty years over the role of religion in politics.
Obama	0	For some time now, there has been plenty of talk among pundits and pollsters that the political divide in this country has fallen sharply along religious lines.
Obama	0	Indeed, the single biggest "gap" in party affiliation among white Americans today is not between men and women, or those who reside in so-called Red States and those who reside in Blue, but between those who attend church regularly and those who don't.
Obama	0	Conservative leaders have been all too happy to exploit this gap, consistently reminding evangelical Christians that Democrats disrespect their values and dislike their Church, while suggesting to the rest of the country that religious Americans care only about issues like abortion and gay marriage; school prayer and intelligent design.
Obama	0	Democrats, for the most part, have taken the bait.
Obama	0	At best, we may try to avoid the conversation about religious values altogether, fearful of offending anyone and claiming that - regardless of our personal beliefs - constitutional principles tie our hands.
Obama	0	At worst, there are some liberals who dismiss religion in the public square as inherently irrational or intolerant, insisting on a caricature of religious Americans that paints them as fanatical, or thinking that the very word "Christian" describes one's political opponents, not people of faith.
Obama	0	Now, such strategies of avoidance may work for progressives when our opponent is Alan Keyes.
Obama	0	But over the long haul, I think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives -- in the lives of the American people -- and I think it's time that we join a serious debate about how to reconcile faith with our modern, pluralistic democracy.
Obama	0	And if we're going to do that then we first need to understand that Americans are a religious people.
Obama	0	90 percent of us believe in God, 70 percent affiliate themselves with an organized religion, 38 percent call themselves committed Christians, and substantially more people in America believe in angels than they do in evolution.
Obama	0	This religious tendency is not simply the result of successful marketing by skilled preachers or the draw of popular mega-churches.
Obama	0	In fact, it speaks to a hunger that's deeper than that - a hunger that goes beyond any particular issue or cause.
Obama	0	Each day, it seems, thousands of Americans are going about their daily rounds - dropping off the kids at school, driving to the office, flying to a business meeting, shopping at the mall, trying to stay on their diets - and they're coming to the realization that something is missing.
Obama	0	They are deciding that their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not enough.
Obama	0	They want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives.
Obama	0	They're looking to relieve a chronic loneliness, a feeling supported by a recent study that shows Americans have fewer close friends and confidants than ever before.
Obama	0	And so they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them - that they are not just destined to travel down that long highway towards nothingness.
Obama	0	And I speak with some experience on this matter.
Obama	0	I was not raised in a particularly religious household, as undoubtedly many in the audience were.
Obama	0	My father, who returned to Kenya when I was just two, was born Muslim but as an adult became an atheist.
Obama	0	My mother, whose parents were non-practicing Baptists and Methodists, was probably one of the most spiritual and kindest people I've ever known, but grew up with a healthy skepticism of organized religion herself.
Obama	0	As a consequence, so did I.
Obama	0	It wasn't until after college, when I went to Chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of Christian churches, that I confronted my own spiritual dilemma.
Obama	0	I was working with churches, and the Christians who I worked with recognized themselves in me.
Obama	0	They saw that I knew their Book and that I shared their values and sang their songs.
Obama	0	But they sensed that a part of me that remained removed, detached, that I was an observer in their midst.
Obama	0	And in time, I came to realize that something was missing as well -- that without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone.
Obama	0	And if it weren't for the particular attributes of the historically black church, I may have accepted this fate.
Obama	0	But as the months passed in Chicago, I found myself drawn - not just to work with the church, but to be in the church.
Obama	0	For one thing, I believed and still believe in the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change, a power made real by some of the leaders here today.
Obama	0	Because of its past, the black church understands in an intimate way the Biblical call to feed the hungry and cloth the naked and challenge powers and principalities.
Obama	0	And in its historical struggles for freedom and the rights of man, I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an active, palpable agent in the world.
Obama	0	As a source of hope.
Obama	0	And perhaps it was out of this intimate knowledge of hardship -- the grounding of faith in struggle -- that the church offered me a second insight, one that I think is important to emphasize today.
Obama	0	Faith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts.
Obama	0	You need to come to church in the first place precisely because you are first of this world, not apart from it.
Obama	0	You need to embrace Christ precisely because you have sins to wash away - because you are human and need an ally in this difficult journey.
Obama	0	It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith.
Obama	0	It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany.
Obama	0	I didn't fall out in church.
Obama	0	The questions I had didn't magically disappear.
Obama	0	But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me.
Obama	0	I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.
Obama	0	That's a path that has been shared by millions upon millions of Americans - evangelicals, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims alike; some since birth, others at certain turning points in their lives.
Obama	0	It is not something they set apart from the rest of their beliefs and values.
Obama	0	In fact, it is often what drives their beliefs and their values.
Obama	0	And that is why that, if we truly hope to speak to people where they're at - to communicate our hopes and values in a way that's relevant to their own - then as progressives, we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse.
Obama	0	Because when we ignore the debate about what it means to be a good Christian or Muslim or Jew; when we discuss religion only in the negative sense of where or how it should not be practiced, rather than in the positive sense of what it tells us about our obligations towards one another; when we shy away from religious venues and religious broadcasts because we assume that we will be unwelcome - others will fill the vacuum, those with the most insular views of faith, or those who cynically use religion to justify partisan ends.
Obama	0	In other words, if we don't reach out to evangelical Christians and other religious Americans and tell them what we stand for, then the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons and Alan Keyeses will continue to hold sway.
Obama	0	More fundamentally, the discomfort of some progressives with any hint of religion has often prevented us from effectively addressing issues in moral terms.
Obama	0	Some of the problem here is rhetorical - if we scrub language of all religious content, we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of Americans understand both their personal morality and social justice.
Obama	0	Imagine Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address without reference to "the judgments of the Lord."
Obama	0	Or King's I Have a Dream speech without references to "all of God's children."
Obama	0	Their summoning of a higher truth helped inspire what had seemed impossible, and move the nation to embrace a common destiny.
Obama	0	Our failure as progressives to tap into the moral underpinnings of the nation is not just rhetorical, though.
Obama	0	Our fear of getting "preachy" may also lead us to discount the role that values and culture play in some of our most urgent social problems.
Obama	0	After all, the problems of poverty and racism, the uninsured and the unemployed, are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten point plan.
Obama	0	They are rooted in both societal indifference and individual callousness - in the imperfections of man.
Obama	0	Solving these problems will require changes in government policy, but it will also require changes in hearts and a change in minds.
Obama	0	I believe in keeping guns out of our inner cities, and that our leaders must say so in the face of the gun manufacturers' lobby - but I also believe that when a gang-banger shoots indiscriminately into a crowd because he feels somebody disrespected him, we've got a moral problem.
Obama	0	There's a hole in that young man's heart - a hole that the government alone cannot fix.
Obama	0	I believe in vigorous enforcement of our non-discrimination laws.
Obama	0	But I also believe that a transformation of conscience and a genuine commitment to diversity on the part of the nation's CEOs could bring about quicker results than a battalion of lawyers.
Obama	0	They have more lawyers than us anyway.
Obama	0	I think that we should put more of our tax dollars into educating poor girls and boys.
Obama	0	I think that the work that Marian Wright Edelman has done all her life is absolutely how we should prioritize our resources in the wealthiest nation on earth.
Obama	0	I also think that we should give them the information about contraception that can prevent unwanted pregnancies, lower abortion rates, and help assure that that every child is loved and cherished.
Obama	0	But, you know, my Bible tells me that if we train a child in the way he should go, when he is old he will not turn from it.
Obama	0	So I think faith and guidance can help fortify a young woman's sense of self, a young man's sense of responsibility, and a sense of reverence that all young people should have for the act of sexual intimacy.
Obama	0	I am not suggesting that every progressive suddenly latch on to religious terminology - that can be dangerous.
Obama	0	Nothing is more transparent than inauthentic expressions of faith.
Obama	0	As Jim has mentioned, some politicians come and clap -- off rhythm -- to the choir.
Obama	0	We don't need that.
Obama	0	In fact, because I do not believe that religious people have a monopoly on morality, I would rather have someone who is grounded in morality and ethics, and who is also secular, affirm their morality and ethics and values without pretending that they're something they're not.
Obama	0	They don't need to do that.
Obama	0	None of us need to do that.
Obama	0	But what I am suggesting is this - secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square.
Obama	0	Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, Williams Jennings Bryant, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King - indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history - were not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause.
Obama	0	So to say that men and women should not inject their "personal morality" into public policy debates is a practical absurdity.
Obama	0	Our law is by definition a codification of morality, much of it grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition.
Obama	0	Moreover, if we progressives shed some of these biases, we might recognize some overlapping values that both religious and secular people share when it comes to the moral and material direction of our country.
Obama	0	We might recognize that the call to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation, the need to think in terms of "thou" and not just "I," resonates in religious congregations all across the country.
Obama	0	And we might realize that we have the ability to reach out to the evangelical community and engage millions of religious Americans in the larger project of American renewal.
Obama	0	Some of this is already beginning to happen.
Obama	0	Pastors, friends of mine like Rick Warren and T.D.
Obama	0	Jakes are wielding their enormous influences to confront AIDS, Third World debt relief, and the genocide in Darfur.
Obama	0	Religious thinkers and activists like our good friend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo are lifting up the Biblical injunction to help the poor as a means of mobilizing Christians against budget cuts to social programs and growing inequality.
Obama	0	And by the way, we need Christians on Capitol Hill, Jews on Capitol Hill and Muslims on Capitol Hill talking about the estate tax.
Obama	0	When you've got an estate tax debate that proposes a trillion dollars being taken out of social programs to go to a handful of folks who don't need and weren't even asking for it, you know that we need an injection of morality in our political debate.
Obama	0	Across the country, individual churches like my own and your own are sponsoring day care programs, building senior centers, helping ex-offenders reclaim their lives, and rebuilding our gulf coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
Obama	0	So the question is, how do we build on these still-tentative partnerships between religious and secular people of good will?
Obama	0	It's going to take more work, a lot more work than we've done so far.
Obama	0	The tensions and the suspicions on each side of the religious divide will have to be squarely addressed.
Obama	0	And each side will need to accept some ground rules for collaboration.
Obama	0	While I've already laid out some of the work that progressive leaders need to do, I want to talk a little bit about what conservative leaders need to do -- some truths they need to acknowledge.
Obama	0	For one, they need to understand the critical role that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy, but the robustness of our religious practice.
Obama	0	Folks tend to forget that during our founding, it wasn't the atheists or the civil libertarians who were the most effective champions of the First Amendment.
Obama	0	It was the persecuted minorities, it was Baptists like John Leland who didn't want the established churches to impose their views on folks who were getting happy out in the fields and teaching the scripture to slaves.
Obama	0	It was the forbearers of the evangelicals who were the most adamant about not mingling government with religious, because they did not want state-sponsored religion hindering their ability to practice their faith as they understood it.
Obama	0	Moreover, given the increasing diversity of America's population, the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater.
Obama	0	Whatever we once were, we are no longer just a Christian nation; we are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, a Hindu nation, and a nation of nonbelievers.
Obama	0	And even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools?
Obama	0	Would we go with James Dobson's, or Al Sharpton's?
Obama	0	Which passages of Scripture should guide our public policy?
Obama	0	Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination?
Obama	0	How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith?
Obama	0	Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount - a passage that is so radical that it's doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application?
Obama	0	So before we get carried away, let's read our bibles.
Obama	0	Folks haven't been reading their bibles.
Obama	0	This brings me to my second point.
Obama	0	Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values.
Obama	0	It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason.
Obama	0	I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will.
Obama	0	I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all.
Obama	0	Now this is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do.
Obama	0	But in a pluralistic democracy, we have no choice.
Obama	0	Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality.
Obama	0	It involves the compromise, the art of what's possible.
Obama	0	At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise.
Obama	0	It's the art of the impossible.
Obama	0	If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the consequences.
Obama	0	To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitments would be a dangerous thing.
Obama	0	And if you doubt that, let me give you an example.
Obama	0	We all know the story of Abraham and Isaac.
Obama	0	Abraham is ordered by God to offer up his only son, and without argument, he takes Isaac to the mountaintop, binds him to an altar, and raises his knife, prepared to act as God has commanded.
Obama	0	Of course, in the end God sends down an angel to intercede at the very last minute, and Abraham passes God's test of devotion.
Obama	0	But it's fair to say that if any of us leaving this church saw Abraham on a roof of a building raising his knife, we would, at the very least, call the police and expect the Department of Children and Family Services to take Isaac away from Abraham.
Obama	0	We would do so because we do not hear what Abraham hears, do not see what Abraham sees, true as those experiences may be.
Obama	0	So the best we can do is act in accordance with those things that we all see, and that we all hear, be it common laws or basic reason.
Obama	0	Finally, any reconciliation between faith and democratic pluralism requires some sense of proportion.
Obama	0	This goes for both sides.
Obama	0	Even those who claim the Bible's inerrancy make distinctions between Scriptural edicts, sensing that some passages - the Ten Commandments, say, or a belief in Christ's divinity - are central to Christian faith, while others are more culturally specific and may be modified to accommodate modern life.
Obama	0	The American people intuitively understand this, which is why the majority of Catholics practice birth control and some of those opposed to gay marriage nevertheless are opposed to a Constitutional amendment to ban it.
Obama	0	Religious leadership need not accept such wisdom in counseling their flocks, but they should recognize this wisdom in their politics.
Obama	0	But a sense of proportion should also guide those who police the boundaries between church and state.
Obama	0	Not every mention of God in public is a breach to the wall of separation - context matters.
Obama	0	It is doubtful that children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance feel oppressed or brainwashed as a consequence of muttering the phrase "under God."
Obama	0	I didn't.
Obama	0	Having voluntary student prayer groups use school property to meet should not be a threat, any more than its use by the High School Republicans should threaten Democrats.
Obama	0	And one can envision certain faith-based programs - targeting ex-offenders or substance abusers - that offer a uniquely powerful way of solving problems.
Obama	0	So we all have some work to do here.
Obama	0	But I am hopeful that we can bridge the gaps that exist and overcome the prejudices each of us bring to this debate.
Obama	0	And I have faith that millions of believing Americans want that to happen.
Obama	0	No matter how religious they may or may not be, people are tired of seeing faith used as a tool of attack.
Obama	0	They don't want faith used to belittle or to divide.
Obama	0	They're tired of hearing folks deliver more screed than sermon.
Obama	0	Because in the end, that's not how they think about faith in their own lives.
Obama	0	So let me end with just one other interaction I had during my campaign.
Obama	0	A few days after I won the Democratic nomination in my U.S. Senate race, I received an email from a doctor at the University of Chicago Medical School that said the following: "Congratulations on your overwhelming and inspiring primary win.
Obama	0	I was happy to vote for you, and I will tell you that I am seriously considering voting for you in the general election.
Obama	0	I write to express my concerns that may, in the end, prevent me from supporting you."
Obama	0	The doctor described himself as a Christian who understood his commitments to be "totalizing."
Obama	0	His faith led him to a strong opposition to abortion and gay marriage, although he said that his faith also led him to question the idolatry of the free market and quick resort to militarism that seemed to characterize much of the Republican agenda.
Obama	0	But the reason the doctor was considering not voting for me was not simply my position on abortion.
Obama	0	Rather, he had read an entry that my campaign had posted on my website, which suggested that I would fight "right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose."
Obama	0	The doctor went on to write: "I sense that you have a strong sense of justice...and I also sense that you are a fair minded person with a high regard for reason...Whatever your convictions, if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women, then you, in my judgment, are not fair-minded....You know that we enter times that are fraught with possibilities for good and for harm, times when we are struggling to make sense of a common polity in the context of plurality, when we are unsure of what grounds we have for making any claims that involve others...I do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about this issue in fair-minded words."
Obama	0	Fair-minded words.
Obama	0	So I looked at my website and found the offending words.
Obama	0	In fairness to them, my staff had written them using standard Democratic boilerplate language to summarize my pro-choice position during the Democratic primary, at a time when some of my opponents were questioning my commitment to protect Roe v. Wade.
Obama	0	Re-reading the doctor's letter, though, I felt a pang of shame.
Obama	0	It is people like him who are looking for a deeper, fuller conversation about religion in this country.
Obama	0	They may not change their positions, but they are willing to listen and learn from those who are willing to speak in fair-minded words.
Obama	0	Those who know of the central and awesome place that God holds in the lives of so many, and who refuse to treat faith as simply another political issue with which to score points.
Obama	0	So I wrote back to the doctor, and I thanked him for his advice.
Obama	0	The next day, I circulated the email to my staff and changed the language on my website to state in clear but simple terms my pro-choice position.
Obama	0	And that night, before I went to bed, I said a prayer of my own - a prayer that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me.
Obama	0	And that night, before I went to bed I said a prayer of my own.
Obama	0	It's a prayer I think I share with a lot of Americans.
Obama	0	A hope that we can live with one another in a way that reconciles the beliefs of each with the good of all.
Obama	0	It's a prayer worth praying, and a conversation worth having in this country in the months and years to come.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Floor Statement on Iraq Debate  TOPIC: Iraq June 21, 2006 Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Iraq Debate Complete Text Mr. President, in October of 2002, I delivered a speech opposing the War in Iraq.
Obama	0	I said that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless man, but that he posed no imminent and direct threat to the United States.
Obama	0	I said that a war in Iraq would take our focus away from our efforts to defeat al-Qaeda.
Obama	0	And, with a volatile mix of ethnic groups and a complicated history, I said that the invasion and occupation of Iraq would require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
Obama	0	In short, I felt the decision unfolding then to invade Iraq was being made without a clear rationale, based more on ideology and politics than fact and reason.
Obama	0	It is with no great pleasure that I recall this now.
Obama	0	Too many young men and women have died.
Obama	0	Too many have been maimed.
Obama	0	Too many hearts have been broken.
Obama	0	I fervently wish I had been wrong about this war; that my concerns had been unfounded.
Obama	0	America and the American people have paid a high price for the decision to invade Iraq and myriad mistakes that followed.
Obama	0	I believe that history will not judge the authors of this war kindly.
Obama	0	For all these reasons, I would like nothing more than to support the Kerry Amendment; to bring our brave troops home on a date certain, and spare the American people more pain, suffering and sorrow.
Obama	0	But having visited Iraq, I'm also acutely aware that a precipitous withdrawal of our troops, driven by Congressional edict rather than the realities on the ground, will not undo the mistakes made by this Administration.
Obama	0	It could compound them.
Obama	0	It could compound them by plunging Iraq into an even deeper and, perhaps, irreparable crisis.
Obama	0	We must exit Iraq, but not in a way that leaves behind a security vacuum filled with terrorism, chaos, ethnic cleansing and genocide that could engulf large swaths of the Middle East and endanger America.
Obama	0	We have both moral and national security reasons to manage our exit in a responsible way.
Obama	0	I share many of the goals set forth in the Kerry Amendment.
Obama	0	We should send a clear message to the Iraqis that we won't be there forever, and that by next year our primary role should be to conduct counter-insurgency actions, train Iraqi security forces, and provide needed logistical support.
Obama	0	Moreover, I share the frustration with an Administration whose policies with respect to Iraq seem to simply repeat the simple-minded refrains of "we know best" and "stay the course."
Obama	0	It's not acceptable to conduct a war where our goals and strategies drift aimlessly regardless of the cost in lives or dollars spent, and where we end up with arbitrary, poll-driven troop reductions by the Administration - the worst of all possible outcomes.
Obama	0	As one who strongly opposed the decision to go to war and who has met with servicemen and women injured in this conflict and seen the pain of the parents and loved ones of those who have died in Iraq, I would like nothing more than for our military involvement to end.
Obama	0	But I do not believe that setting a date certain for the total withdrawal of U.S. troops is the best approach to achieving, in a methodical and responsible way, the three basic goals that should drive our Iraq policy: that is, 1) stabilizing Iraq and giving the factions within Iraq the space they need to forge a political settlement; 2) containing and ultimately defeating the insurgency in Iraq; and 3) bringing our troops safely home.
Obama	0	What is needed is a blueprint for an expeditious yet responsible exit from Iraq.
Obama	0	A hard and fast, arbitrary deadline for withdrawal offers our commanders in the field, and our diplomats in the region, insufficient flexibility to implement that strategy.
Obama	0	For example, let's say that a phased withdrawal results in fifty thousand troops in Iraq by July 19, 2007.
Obama	0	If, at that point, our generals and the Iraqi government tell us that having those troops in Iraq for an additional three or six months would enhance stability and security in the region, this amendment would potentially prevent us from pursuing the optimal policy.
Obama	0	It is for this reason that I cannot support the Kerry Amendment.
Obama	0	Instead, I am a cosponsor of the Levin amendment, which gives us the best opportunity to find this balance between our need to begin a phase-down and our need to help stabilize Iraq.
Obama	0	It tells the Iraqis that we won't be there forever so that they need to move forward on uniting and securing their country.
Obama	0	I agree with Senator Warner that the message should be "we really mean business, Iraqis, get on with it."
Obama	0	At the same time, the amendment also provides the Iraqis the time and the opportunity to accomplish this critical goal.
Obama	0	Essential to a successful policy is the Administration listening to its generals and diplomats and members of Congress - especially those who disagree with their policies and believe it is time to start bringing our troops home.
Obama	0	The overwhelming majority of the Senate is already on record voting for an amendment stating that calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security, creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq.
Obama	0	The Levin Amendment builds on this approach.
Obama	0	The White House should follow this principle as well.
Obama	0	Visiting Iraq for a few hours cannot resuscitate or justify a failed policy.
Obama	0	No amount of spin or photo opportunities can change the bottom line: this war has been poorly conceived and poorly managed by the White House, and that is why it has been so poorly received by the American people.. And it's troubling to already see Karl Rove in New Hampshire, treating this as a political attack opportunity instead of a major national challenge around which to rally the country.
Obama	0	There are no easy answers to this war.
Obama	0	I understand that many Americans want to see our troops come home.
Obama	0	The chaos, violence, and horrors in Iraq are gut-wrenching reminders of what our men and women in uniform, some just months out of high school, must confront on a daily basis.
Obama	0	They are doing this heroically, they are doing this selflessly, and more than 2,500 of them have now made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.
Obama	0	Not one of us wants to see our servicemen and women in harm's way a day longer than they have to be.
Obama	0	And that's why we must find the most responsible way to bring them home as quickly as possible, while still leaving the foundation of a secure Iraq that will not endanger the free world.
Obama	0	Northwestern University Commencement Address  TOPIC: Commencement June 16, 2006 Northwestern University Commencement Address Complete Text Good morning President Bienen, the Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, and the Class of 2006.
Obama	0	Congratulations on your graduation, and thank you for allowing me the honor to be a part of it.
Obama	0	A few months ago, I came across an article in your student newspaper by Elaine Meyer.
Obama	0	Elaine, give me a little wave if you're out there.
Obama	0	There she is.
Obama	0	Glad to see you made it to graduation.
Obama	0	So, Elaine wrote this article entitled, "Challenge us, Senator Obama."
Obama	0	I thought this seemed like a fair request, so I kept reading.
Obama	0	And I noticed that Elaine set out a few expectations for this speech.
Obama	0	According to the article, I'm supposed to be inspirational, but not contrived.
Obama	0	I'm supposed to be hopeful, but not cheesy.
Obama	0	I should be political, but not too political.
Obama	0	I should be better than John McCain, but not so good that I have to spend the day with Jerry Falwell.
Obama	0	To further illustrate what she was looking for, Elaine then very kindly quoted at length from the commencement address I gave at Knox College in Galesburg last year - which then completely ruined my plan to recycle that speech for this year.
Obama	0	Left with no speech and a lot of pressure, I turned to who else but Elaine for help.
Obama	0	And what she wrote next is precisely what I'd like to talk you about today.
Obama	0	She said, "When people say they don't want to hear about politics in a commencement address, they are in part speaking of not wanting to hear about the outside world and its problems.
Obama	0	We students have been insulated enough for the past four years that it shouldn't hurt us to be challenged for thirty minutes, especially on a day that marks our commencement into the 'real' world."
Obama	0	That struck me as an important statement.
Obama	0	And it called to mind a passage from scriptures that some of you may know: Corinthians 13:11: "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child.
Obama	0	Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things."
Obama	0	I bring this up because there's an assumption in rites of passage like this that growing up is just a function of age; that becoming an adult is an inevitable and natural progression.
Obama	0	But in fact, I know a whole lot of thirty year olds and forty year olds and fifty year olds who are not yet full-grown.
Obama	0	And if you talk to my wife, she'll tell you that there are times when I do not put aside childish things; when I continually struggle to rise above the selfish or the petty or the small.
Obama	0	So even today, as a U.S.
Obama	0	Senator, I have to remind myself of certain lessons from my own youth - lessons about growing up and being true to my values and ideals.
Obama	0	The first lesson came during my first year in college.
Obama	0	Back then I had a tendency, in my mother's words, to act a bit casual about my future.
Obama	0	I rebelled, angry in the way that many young men in general, and young black man in particular, are angry, thinking that responsibility and hard work were old-fashioned conventions that didn't apply to me.
Obama	0	I partied a little too much and studied just enough to get by.
Obama	0	And once, after a particularly long night of partying, we had spilled a little too much beer, broke a few too many bottles, and trashed a little too much of the dorm.
Obama	0	And the next day, the mess was so bad that when one of the cleaning ladies saw it, she began to tear up.
Obama	0	And when a girlfriend of mine heard about this, she said to me, "That woman could've been my grandmother, Barack.
Obama	0	She spent her days cleaning up after somebody else's mess."
Obama	0	Which drove home for me the first lesson of growing up: The world doesn't just revolve around you.
Obama	0	There's a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit.
Obama	0	But I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit - the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes; to see the world through those who are different from us - the child who's hungry, the laid-off steelworker, the immigrant woman cleaning your dorm room.
Obama	0	As you go on in life, cultivating this quality of empathy will become harder, not easier.
Obama	0	There's no community service requirement in the real world; no one forcing you to care.
Obama	0	You'll be free to live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the same schools, and narrow your concerns to what's going in your own little circle.
Obama	0	Not only that - we live in a culture that discourages empathy.
Obama	0	A culture that too often tells us our principle goal in life is to be rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained.
Obama	0	A culture where those in power too often encourage these selfish impulses.
Obama	0	They will tell you that the Americans who sleep in the streets and beg for food got there because they're all lazy or weak of spirit.
Obama	0	That the inner-city children who are trapped in dilapidated schools can't learn and won't learn and so we should just give up on them entirely.
Obama	0	That the innocent people being slaughtered and expelled from their homes half a world away are somebody else's problem to take care of.
Obama	0	I hope you don't listen to this.
Obama	0	I hope you choose to broaden, and not contract, your ambit of concern.
Obama	0	Not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation.
Obama	0	Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.
Obama	0	It's because you have an obligation to yourself.
Obama	0	Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation.
Obama	0	And because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential - and become full-grown.
Obama	0	The second lesson I learned after college, when I had this crazy idea that I wanted to be a community organizer and work in low-income neighborhoods.
Obama	0	My mother and grandparents thought I should go to law school.
Obama	0	My friends had applied for jobs on Wall Street.
Obama	0	But I went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that I could think of.
Obama	0	And finally, this small group of churches on the south side of Chicago wrote back and gave me a job organizing neighborhoods devastated by steel-plant closings in the early 80s.
Obama	0	The churches didn't have much money - so they offered me a grand sum of $12,000 a year plus $1,000 to buy a car.
Obama	0	And I got ready to move to Chicago - a place I had never been and where I didn't know a living soul.
Obama	0	Even people who didn't know me were skeptical of my decision.
Obama	0	I remember having a conversation with an older man I had met before I arrived in Chicago.
Obama	0	I told him about my plans, and he looked at me and said, "Let me tell something.
Obama	0	You look like a nice clean-cut young man, and you've got a nice voice.
Obama	0	So let me give you a piece of advice - forget this community organizing business.
Obama	0	You can't change the world, and people won't appreciate you trying.
Obama	0	What you should do is go into television broadcasting.
Obama	0	I'm telling you, you've got a future."
Obama	0	I could've taken my mother's advice and I could've taken my grandparents advice.
Obama	0	I could've taken the path my friends traveled.
Obama	0	And objectively speaking, that TV thing might have made some sense.
Obama	0	But I knew there was something in me that wanted to try for something bigger.
Obama	0	So the second lesson is this: Challenge yourself.
Obama	0	Take some risks in your life.
Obama	0	This may be difficult for all of you because one of the great things about graduating from Northwestern is that you can now punch your own ticket.
Obama	0	You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house and the large salary and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should buy.
Obama	0	But I hope you don't.
Obama	0	Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition.
Obama	0	It asks too little of yourself.
Obama	0	And it will leave you unfulfilled.
Obama	0	I often think about the young Americans - teenagers and college kids not much older than you - from all over the country, watching the Civil Rights Movement unfold before them on their television sets.
Obama	0	I imagine that they would've seen the marchers and heard the speeches, but they also probably saw the dogs and the fire hoses, or the footage of innocent people being beaten within an inch of their lives; or heard the news the day those four little girls died when someone threw a bomb into their church.
Obama	0	Instinctively, they knew that it was safer and smarter to stay at home; to watch the movement from afar.
Obama	0	But they also understood that these people in Georgia and Alabama and Mississippi were their brothers and sisters; that what was happening was wrong; and that they had an obligation to make it right.
Obama	0	When the buses pulled up for a Freedom Ride down South, they got on.
Obama	0	They took a risk.
Obama	0	And they changed the world.
Obama	0	So don't let people talk you into doing the safe thing.
Obama	0	Listen to what's inside of you and decide what it is that you care about so much that you're willing to risk it all.
Obama	0	The third lesson is one that I learned once I got to Chicago.
Obama	0	I had spent weeks organizing our very first community meeting around the issue of gang violence.
Obama	0	We invited the police; we made phone calls, went to churches, and passed out flyers.
Obama	0	I had been warned of the turf battles and bad politics between certain community leaders, but I ignored them, confident that I knew what I was doing.
Obama	0	The night of the meeting we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of the crowd.
Obama	0	And we waited.
Obama	0	And we waited.
Obama	0	And finally, a group of older people walk in to the hall.
Obama	0	And they sit down.
Obama	0	And this little old lady raises her hand and asks, "Is this where the bingo game is?"
Obama	0	Thirteen people showed up that night.
Obama	0	The police never came.
Obama	0	And the meeting was a complete disaster.
Obama	0	Later, the volunteers I worked with told me they were quitting - that they had been doing this for two years and had nothing to show for it.
Obama	0	I was tired too.
Obama	0	But at that point, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street, tossing stones at boarded-up apartment building.
Obama	0	And I turned to the volunteers, and I asked them, "Before you quit, I want you to answer one question.
Obama	0	What's gonna happen to those boys?
Obama	0	Who will fight for them if not us?
Obama	0	Who will give them a fair shot if we leave?"
Obama	0	And at that moment, we were all reminded of a third lesson in growing up: Persevere.
Obama	0	Making your mark on the world is hard.
Obama	0	If it were easy, everybody would do it.
Obama	0	But it's not.
Obama	0	It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way.
Obama	0	The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't.
Obama	0	it's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere.
Obama	0	After my little speech that day, one by one, the volunteers decided not to quit.
Obama	0	We went back to those neighborhoods, and we kept at it, sustaining ourselves with the small victories.
Obama	0	And over time, a community changed.
Obama	0	And so had we.
Obama	0	Cultivating empathy, challenging yourself, persevering in the face of adversity - these are the qualities that I've found to be important in my own life.
Obama	0	But what's true for individuals can also be true for nations.
Obama	0	For what America needs right now, more than ever, is a sense of purpose to guide us through the challenges that lie ahead; a maturity that we seem to have lost somewhere along the way; a willingness to engage in a sober, adult conversation about our future.
Obama	0	When we measure our greatness as a nation by how far the stock market rises or falls instead of how many opportunities we've opened up for America's children, we're displaying a preference for the childish.
Obama	0	When we believe that force is the only way to accomplish our ends in the world, when our leaders exaggerate or fudge the truth, we haven't set aside childish things.
Obama	0	When we run our budget into red ink for things that we want instead of things that we need, we're indicating that we're not yet full-grown.
Obama	0	For a brief moment, there was the hope that this kind of politics would've ended after 9/11.
Obama	0	There was a sense of unity born from the rubble of those buildings - young people signing up to serve; political leaders of both parties working together; people asking new questions about our world, hungry for the answers.
Obama	0	But at some point, we began to drift.
Obama	0	Republican and Democrat alike went back to procrastinating about problems that we now have to face.
Obama	0	We sent young Americans to fight a war without asking anyone back home to sacrifice their time or their tax cut.
Obama	0	We argue about the inconsequential, and caricature our opponents to score cheap political points.
Obama	0	Our media returned to covering the sensational and feeding our ever-shortening attention span.
Obama	0	And in the meantime, our problems are left to fester.
Obama	0	We have a global economy that's forcing us to compete like never before.
Obama	0	In today's world a job can now travel anywhere there's an internet connection and a worker who's smart and skilled.
Obama	0	And if China and India keep educating their kids better and longer than we are, that's where the jobs will go.
Obama	0	We can meet this challenge if we fix our schools, if we make college affordable, if we train our workers, if we invest more in research and technology.
Obama	0	We know what needs to be done.
Obama	0	What's lacking is the political will.
Obama	0	We have a health care crisis in this country that's left 46 million Americans uninsured; that's left millions unable to deal with rising co-payments; that's left businesses near bankruptcy.
Obama	0	We can meet this challenge if we modernize our health care system, if we improve quality, if we pool our resources to bargain for affordable insurance.
Obama	0	What's been lacking is the political will.
Obama	0	We have an energy crisis that's keeping gas prices high; destroying our climate, and forcing us to send billions of dollars to the very countries who want to cause us harm.
Obama	0	We can meet this challenge if we harness alternative fuels and build cars that go further on a tank of gas.
Obama	0	But we need to find the will to make it happen.
Obama	0	We need new strategies to fight the war on terror.
Obama	0	In a world where terrorists can hide and blend into any city on the planet, we can't just believe - as Bill Clinton says - that we can kill or jail every single one of our enemies.
Obama	0	We can meet this challenge if we realize this isn't just battle of armies but also of ideas; if we rebuild our institutions and strengthen our alliances as Truman and Acheson and Keenan and Marshall did after World War II; if we bring hope to those pockets of desperation where a jihad is a better bet than a job.
Obama	0	But what's lacking is that political will.
Obama	0	Each and every one of these challenges call for an America that is more purposeful, more grown-up than the America that we have today.
Obama	0	An America that reflects the lessons that have helped so many of its people mature in their own lives.
Obama	0	An America that's about not just each of us, but all of us.
Obama	0	An America that takes great risks in the face of greater odds.
Obama	0	An America that, above all, perseveres.
Obama	0	Over one hundred and fifty classes have sat where you sit today, some in good times, others in bad.
Obama	0	Some were years that just rolled into the next, and others would mark a turning point in our nation.
Obama	0	The class of 1860 would find their country torn apart by civil war in less than a year.
Obama	0	Many of them would listen to their President tell them that a house divided cannot stand, and they would answer the call to save a union and free a people.
Obama	0	The class of 1932 would look out a nation in mired in depression; a nation ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed.
Obama	0	They would hear a man who could not lift himself from his wheelchair lift a nation by telling us that it was only fear itself standing in our way.
Obama	0	And they would answer the call to conquer that fear.
Obama	0	The class of 1960 would find themselves at the beginning of a decade where social and racial strife threatened to tear apart the very fabric of the nation.
Obama	0	They would hear a young President urge them to ask what they could do for their country.
Obama	0	And they would answer the call to sit at lunch counters and take those Freedom Rides; they would march for justice and live for equality.
Obama	0	And now it is 2006.
Obama	0	And here you sit facing challenges as great as any in the past.
Obama	0	And the choice is yours.
Obama	0	Will the years pass with barely a whisper from your generation?
Obama	0	Or will we look back on this time as the moment where you took a stand and changed the world?
Obama	0	Time will tell.
Obama	0	You will be tested by the challenges of this new century, and at times you will fail.
Obama	0	But know that you have it within your power to try.
Obama	0	That generations who have come before you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time.
Obama	0	And that if we're willing to shoulder each other's burdens, to take great risks, and to persevere through trial, America will continue on its magnificent journey towards that distant horizon, and a better day.
Obama	0	Thank you so much to the class of 2006, congratulations on your graduation, and Elaine - I hope I did okay.
Obama	0	Katrina Reconstruction Contracts and US toll in Iraq  TOPIC: Katrina & Gulf Recovery and Iraq June 15, 2006 Katrina Reconstruction Contracts/US Toll in Iraq Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama and today is Thursday, June 15, 2006.
Obama	0	I want to talk to you guys today about Katrina.
Obama	0	I know that we've had a number of discussions about the process of rebuilding and what's been happening and what hasn't been happening down in the Gulf.
Obama	0	Some of you may recall that a while back that I introduced a piece of legislation that should be pretty straightforward.
Obama	0	It essentially said that all Katrina reconstruction contracts in excess of $500,000 had to be competitively bid.
Obama	0	This was prompted by news reports that enormous amounts of waste were taking place in the Katrina contracting process.
Obama	0	You had multibillion dollar no-bid contracts for things as varied as debris removal or buying tarps to put on roofs, trailers for people who had been displaced.
Obama	0	Many of these items had been purchased, or services had been purchased, at two or three or five times the typical market value and, obviously, any money that's wasted going to contractors is money that is coming out of taxpayers' pockets and not getting to the intended beneficiaries - the people who have been displaced as a consequence of the hurricane.
Obama	0	So, myself and Tom Coburn (Republican from Oklahoma) introduced a very simple amendment in the Emergency Defense Supplemental.
Obama	0	It essentially said that if there is going to be a contract of more than half a million dollars, it has to be competitively bid.
Obama	0	The amendment passed 98 to 0; the entire Senate was unanimous.
Obama	0	But, as some of you may not be aware, the way Washington works is a bill that passes in the Senate and a bill that passes in the House has to be reconciled in what is called a conference committee because there are going to be differences, potentially, between what's in the House version and the Senate version.
Obama	0	Those have to be worked out in a conference of House members and Senate members.
Obama	0	I wasn't on the conference committee; neither was Tom Coburn.
Obama	0	When the conference committee report finally came out, the bill that would actually be voted on and signed into law, our little provision had been struck - it wasn't in there.
Obama	0	Since that time we got that news there's at least 1.4 billion dollars of taxpayer money that could have gone to helping the people on the coast that instead has been siphoned off on a series of fraudulent claims; spending on everything from Girls Gone Wild videos to vacation trips to Hawaii to, in one case, a sex change operation.
Obama	0	Now, this didn't have to do with contracting - it had to do with claims - but it indicated the complete lack of oversight by which we are spending billions of dollars down on the Gulf Coast.
Obama	0	So, as a consequence, I am reintroducing with Tom Coburn our provision to end no-bid contracts.
Obama	0	We are going to introduce that into the Department of Defense Authorization Bill next week.
Obama	0	I just want you guys to track this because these small provisions and amendments and details are really what make up the guts of what's going on here in Washington.
Obama	0	We'll have big debates on abortion, gay marriage, what's happening in respect to the war in Iraq - many of these issues are critically important, but what really determines how our government acts often are these provisions, these amendments, these conference committee reports.
Obama	0	They don't get a lot of attention: reporters, oftentimes, don't track them, except for maybe the specialty press, the newspapers here in Washington.
Obama	0	But it's important, I think, for everybody who's listening out there to be aware of what's going on because unless the citizenry is informed about the procedures and processes in Washington, it's very difficult to hold our elected officials accountable.
Obama	0	And there are times, I'll confess, where I can get extremely frustrated just because good provisions, like the one that Tom Coburn and I introduced that passed 98 to 0, still aren't able to get signed into law.
Obama	0	Hopefully we'll be able to make progress on this one.
Obama	0	Coming up next week there is going to be a vigorous debate around spending with respect to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Obama	0	The House is sponsoring a major debate on their side.
Obama	0	I suspect we'll have a series of amendments that we'll being dealing with on the Senate side, as well.
Obama	0	And so, rather than talk about those today, I'm going to wait until we've had some of the debate take place so I can give you guys some insight in terms of how people are thinking about it on both sides of the aisle.
Obama	0	In the meantime, I think it is worth noting that today we passed the 2,500 casualty mark in terms of the war in Iraq: twenty-five hundred American heroes, servicemen and servicewomen, who have been killed in Iraq.
Obama	0	We observed a moment of silence on the Senate floor today and it might make sense for some of you guys just to think about those men and women, as well as their families, and the enormous sacrifice that they've made.
Obama	0	I look forward talking to you guys next week.
Obama	0	Bye-bye.
Obama	0	Take Back America Speech  TOPIC: Our Past, Our Future & Vision for America June 14, 2006 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: Take Back America Complete Text Thank you.
Obama	0	Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America.
Obama	0	My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history.
Obama	0	It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
Obama	0	Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.
Obama	0	These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.
Obama	0	These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.
Obama	0	I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race.
Obama	0	A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running.
Obama	0	Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.
Obama	0	And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.
Obama	0	I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature.
Obama	0	And everywhere I went I'd get two questions: First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?"
Obama	0	Because people just couldn't pronounce it.
Obama	0	They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama."
Obama	0	And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
Obama	0	And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.
Obama	0	You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
Obama	0	And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.
Obama	0	That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.
Obama	0	So I understand the cynicism.
Obama	0	But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate.
Obama	0	We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live.
Obama	0	And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
Obama	0	And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked.
Obama	0	And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old.
Obama	0	And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
Obama	0	I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky.
Obama	0	That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways.
Obama	0	That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was.
Obama	0	I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.
Obama	0	And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote.
Obama	0	And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security.
Obama	0	How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America.
Obama	0	She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn.
Obama	0	And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
Obama	0	And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
Obama	0	And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.
Obama	0	She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation.
Obama	0	And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
Obama	0	And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.
Obama	0	She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed.
Obama	0	She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.
Obama	0	She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.
Obama	0	And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused.
Obama	0	Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are.
Obama	0	Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.
Obama	0	And I think that we face one of those moments today.
Obama	0	In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
Obama	0	The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
Obama	0	And with this new world comes new risks and new dangers.
Obama	0	No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.
Obama	0	No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.
Obama	0	Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.
Obama	0	The world has changed.
Obama	0	And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas.
Obama	0	We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket.
Obama	0	We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.
Obama	0	But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still.
Obama	0	Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.
Obama	0	It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now.
Obama	0	The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away.
Obama	0	That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams.
Obama	0	That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
Obama	0	Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore.
Obama	0	You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.
Obama	0	He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words: Had enough?
Obama	0	I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here.
Obama	0	Because I think we've all had enough.
Obama	0	Enough of the broken promises.
Obama	0	Enough of the failed leadership.
Obama	0	Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance.
Obama	0	Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
Obama	0	I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
Obama	0	I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
Obama	0	I've had enough of that.
Obama	0	I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
Obama	0	I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers.
Obama	0	I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers.
Obama	0	And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
Obama	0	You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building.
Obama	0	We just didn't know he was talking about this one.
Obama	0	Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man.
Obama	0	I think he loves his country.
Obama	0	I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.
Obama	0	The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is.
Obama	0	It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.
Obama	0	The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
Obama	0	That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...
Obama	0	It's called the Ownership Society in Washington.
Obama	0	But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
Obama	0	It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
Obama	0	It's a bracing idea.
Obama	0	It's a tempting idea.
Obama	0	And it's the easiest thing in the world.
Obama	0	But there's just one problem.
Obama	0	It doesn't work.
Obama	0	It ignores our history.
Obama	0	Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.
Obama	0	But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility.
Obama	0	The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
Obama	0	Americans know this.
Obama	0	We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
Obama	0	But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own.
Obama	0	We know that there are some things we do better together.
Obama	0	We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
Obama	0	That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.
Obama	0	That's what America is.
Obama	0	And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
Obama	0	Because I think that this is our moment to lead.
Obama	0	The time for our party's identity crisis is over.
Obama	0	Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves.
Obama	0	We know who we are.
Obama	0	And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough.
Obama	0	So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity.
Obama	0	That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
Obama	0	Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans.
Obama	0	The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.
Obama	0	The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
Obama	0	Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America.
Obama	0	The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies.
Obama	0	The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
Obama	0	Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances.
Obama	0	And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
Obama	0	And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
Obama	0	The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot.
Obama	0	If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.
Obama	0	Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans.
Obama	0	We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
Obama	0	Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership.
Obama	0	They are longing for direction.
Obama	0	And they want to believe again.
Obama	0	A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.
Obama	0	At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
Obama	0	The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding.
Obama	0	Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story.
Obama	0	And she began to cry.
Obama	0	When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing.
Obama	0	I did not need sewing either.
Obama	0	I knew how to sew.
Obama	0	My mother is a seamstress in a factory.
Obama	0	I'm trying to go to college.
Obama	0	I don't need to sew to go to college.
Obama	0	My mother sews.
Obama	0	I hoped for something else."
Obama	0	I hoped for something else.
Obama	0	I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too.
Obama	0	And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?
Obama	0	Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?
Obama	0	Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?
Obama	0	Will all her childhood hopes be fulfilled?
Obama	0	We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
Obama	0	Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time.
Obama	0	Our time to make a mark on history.
Obama	0	Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.
Obama	0	Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.
Obama	0	And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
Obama	0	They can say that this was the time when America found its way.
Obama	0	They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
Obama	0	Network Neutrality - Podcast   TOPIC: Technology June 8, 2006 Network Neutrality Snowe and Dorgan's legislation to protect network neutrality Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama and today is Thursday, June 8th, 2006.
Obama	0	The topic today is net neutrality.
Obama	0	The internet today is an open platform where the demand for websites and services dictates success.
Obama	0	You've got barriers to entry that are low and equal for all comers.
Obama	0	And it's because the internet is a neutral platform that I can put on this podcast and transmit it over the internet without having to go through some corporate media middleman.
Obama	0	I can say what I want without censorship.
Obama	0	I don't have to pay a special charge.
Obama	0	But the big telephone and cable companies want to change the internet as we know it.
Obama	0	They say they want to create high-speed lanes on the internet and strike exclusive contractual arrangements with internet content-providers for access to those high-speed lanes.
Obama	0	Those of us who can't pony up the cash for these high-speed connections will be relegated to the slow lanes.
Obama	0	Allowing the Bells and cable companies to act as gatekeepers with control over internet access would make the internet like cable.
Obama	0	A producer-driven market with barriers to entry for website creators and preferential treatment for specific sites based not on merit, the number of hits, but on relationships with the corporate gatekeeper.
Obama	0	If there were four or more competitive providers of broadband service to every home, then cable and telephone companies would not be able to create a bidding war for access to the high-speed lanes.
Obama	0	But here's the problem.
Obama	0	More than 99 percent of households get their broadband services from either cable or a telephone company.
Obama	0	So here's my view.
Obama	0	We can't have a situation in which the corporate duopoly dictates the future of the internet and that's why I'm supporting what is called net neutrality.
Obama	0	In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee reached different conclusions on network neutrality.
Obama	0	Judiciary Committee members voted to protect net neutrality and commerce voted with the Bells and cable.
Obama	0	That debate is going to hit the House floor this Friday.
Obama	0	In the Senate, Senators Snowe and Dorgan are leading the fight for net neutrality and I've joined in that effort.
Obama	0	Senator Inouye, the ranking Democrat of the Commerce Committee, has joined us in this effort as well and he's working with Senator Stevens to put strong network neutrality into any Senate bill that comes before us.
Obama	0	There is widespread support among consumer groups, leading academics and the most innovative internet companies, including Google and Yahoo, in favor of net neutrality.
Obama	0	And part of the reason for that is companies like Google and Yahoo might never have gotten started had they not been in a position to easily access the internet and do so on the same terms as the big corporate companies that were interested in making money on the internet.
Obama	0	I know if you are listening to this podcast that you are going to take an intense interest in this issue as well.
Obama	0	Congress is going to need to hear your voice because the Bell and cable companies are going to be dedicating millions of dollars to defeating network neutrality.
Obama	0	So I'll keep you updated on this important issue and I look forward to talking to you guys again next week.
Obama	0	Bye-bye.
Obama	0	Federal Marriage Amendment  TOPIC: Domestic Policy Related June 5, 2006 Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama Federal Marriage Amendment Complete Text Today, we take up the valuable time of the U.S. Senate with a proposed amendment to our Constitution that has absolutely no chance of passing.
Obama	0	We do this, allegedly, in an attempt to uphold the institution of marriage in this country.
Obama	0	We do this despite the fact that for over two hundred years, Americans have been defining and defending marriage on the state and local level without any help from the U.S. Constitution at all.
Obama	0	And yet, we're here anyway because it's an election year - because the party in power has decided that the best way to get voters to the polls is not by talking about Iraq or health care or energy or education, but about a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage that they have no chance of passing.
Obama	0	Now, I realize that for some Americans, this is an important issue.
Obama	0	And I should say that personally, I do believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.
Obama	0	But let's be honest.
Obama	0	That's not what this debate is about.
Obama	0	Not at this time.
Obama	0	This debate is an attempt to break a consensus that is quietly being forged in this country.
Obama	0	It's a consensus between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, Red States and Blue States, that it's time for new leadership in this country - leadership that will stop dividing us, stop disappointing us, and start addressing the problems facing most Americans.
Obama	0	It's a consensus between a majority of Americans who say, "You know what, maybe some of us are comfortable with gay marriage right now and some of us are not.
Obama	0	But most of us do believe that gay couples should be able to visit each other in the hospital and share health care benefits; most of us do believe that they should be treated with dignity and have their privacy respected by the federal government."
Obama	0	And we all know that if this amendment were to pass, it would close the door on much of this - because we know that when similar amendments passed in places like Ohio and Michigan and Utah, domestic partnership benefits were taken away from gay couples.
Obama	0	This is not what the majority of the American people want.
Obama	0	And this is not about trying to build consensus in this country; it's not about trying to bring people together.
Obama	0	This is about winning an election.
Obama	0	That's why the issue was last raised in July of 2004, and that's why we haven't heard about it again until now.
Obama	0	And while this is supposedly a measure that the other party raised to appeal to some of its core supporters, I don't know how happy I'd be if my party only talked about an issue I cared about right around election time - especially if they knew it had no chance of passing.
Obama	0	I agree with most Americans, with Democrats and Republicans, with Vice President Cheney, with over 2,000 religious leaders of all different beliefs, that decisions about marriage, as they always have, should be left to the states.
Obama	0	Today, we should take this amendment only for what it is - a political ploy designed to rally a few supporters and draw the country's attention away from this leadership's past failures and America's future challenges.
Obama	0	There is plenty of work to be done in this country.
Obama	0	There are millions without health care and skyrocketing gas prices and children in crumbling schools and thousands of young Americans risking their lives in Iraq.
Obama	0	So don't tell me that this is the best use of our time.
Obama	0	Don't tell me that this is what people want to see talked about on TV and in the newspapers all day.
Obama	0	We wonder why the American people have such a low opinion of Washington these days.
Obama	0	This is why.
Obama	0	We are better than this.
Obama	0	And we certainly owe the American people more than this.
Obama	0	I know that this amendment will fail, and when it does, I hope we can start discussing issues and offering proposals that will actually improve the lives of most Americans.
Obama	0	University of Massachusetts at Boston Commencement Address  TOPIC: Commencement June 2, 2006 University of Massachusetts at Boston Commencement Address Complete Text Good morning President Wilson, Chancellor Collins, the Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, and the Class of 2006.
Obama	0	Congratulations on your graduation, and thank you for allowing me the honor to be a part of it.
Obama	0	It's always great to be back in Boston.
Obama	0	As some of you may have heard, I was here a few years ago to give the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention.
Obama	0	It was an amazing experience for me.
Obama	0	A humbling honor.
Obama	0	A tremendous opportunity.
Obama	0	And if you had come up to me a few years earlier and told me I'd be there, I would've politely told you that you were out of your mind.
Obama	0	Let me tell you what happened at the last convention I had been to.
Obama	0	It was the year 2000, and I had just gotten my rear-end handed to me in my very first race for Congress.
Obama	0	Didn't even make it past the primary.
Obama	0	I was a little depressed, and more than a little broke, but some friends suggested that I get my mind off it by going to Los Angeles, where that year's Democratic Convention was being held.
Obama	0	So I decided to go.
Obama	0	And when my plane landed in LA, I got my luggage, walked on over to the Hertz counter, filled out all the forms to rent a car, gave my credit card to the nice woman behind the counter who, moments later, handed it back to me and said, "Mr. Obama, it seems we have a problem."
Obama	0	That's right, my credit card was denied.
Obama	0	After thirty more minutes of haggling, I finally made it to the convention, only to learn that I was thought of so highly by the Democratic Party that my credentials barely granted me access to the men's room - let alone backstage where all the action was.
Obama	0	And so, being the VIP that I was, I spent the rest of the week as the guy in the room who nobody knew, but everyone knew didn't belong.
Obama	0	Needless to say, when they asked me to be the convention's keynote speaker just four years later, I made sure I was getting a car.
Obama	0	All joking aside, receiving that honor was a welcome change - and, as MasterCard could attest, more than a little unlikely.
Obama	0	But of course, America is an unlikely place - a country built on defiance of the odds; on a belief in the impossible.
Obama	0	And I remind you of this because as you set out to live your own stories of success and achievement, it's now your turn to help keep it this way.
Obama	0	It's your turn to keep this daringly radical but unfailingly simple notion of America alive - that no matter where you're born or how much your parents have; no matter what you look like or what you believe in, you can still rise to become whatever you want; still go on to achieve great things; still pursue the happiness you hope for.
Obama	0	Today, this dream sounds common - perhaps even cliche - yet for most of human history it's been anything but.
Obama	0	As a servant of Rome, a peasant in China, or a subject of King George, there were very few unlikely futures.
Obama	0	No matter how hard you worked or struggled for something better, you knew you'd spend your life forced to build somebody else's empire; to sacrifice for someone else's cause.
Obama	0	But as the centuries passed, the people of the world grew restless.
Obama	0	They were tired of tyranny and weary of their lot in life.
Obama	0	And as they saw merchants start to sail across oceans and explorers set off in search of new worlds, they followed.
Obama	0	It was right here, in the waters around us, where the American experiment began.
Obama	0	As the earliest settlers arrived on the shores of Boston and Salem and Plymouth, they dreamed of building a City upon a Hill.
Obama	0	And the world watched, waiting to see if this improbable idea called America would succeed.
Obama	0	For over two hundred years, it has.
Obama	0	Not because our dream has progressed perfectly.
Obama	0	It hasn't.
Obama	0	It has been scarred by our treatment of native peoples, betrayed by slavery, clouded by the subjugation of women, wounded by racism, shaken by war and depression.
Obama	0	Yet, the true test of our union is not whether it's perfect, but whether we work to perfect it.
Obama	0	Whether we recognize our failings, identify our shortcomings, and then rise to meet the challenges of our time.
Obama	0	And so we've broadened the American family by winning civil rights and voting rights for women and then African Americans; by choosing to welcome waves of new immigrants to our shores.
Obama	0	We've pushed the boundaries of opportunity by providing free education for our children and health care for our seniors and our poor; and we've won bargaining rights and wage hikes and retirement security for our workers.
Obama	0	None of this progress happened on its own.
Obama	0	Much of it seemed impossible at the time.
Obama	0	But all of it came about because ordinary men and women had faith that here in America, our imperfect dream could be perfected.
Obama	0	Now, there may be some who doubt that much has changed - those who doubt that things are better today than they were yesterday.
Obama	0	To them I say take a look at this class of 2006.
Obama	0	More than half of you represent the very first member of your family to ever attend college.
Obama	0	In the most diverse university in all of New England, I look out at a sea of faces that are African-American and Hispanic-American and Asian-American and Arab-American.
Obama	0	I see students that have come here from over 100 different countries, believing like those first settlers that they too could find a home in this City on a Hill - that they too could find success in this unlikeliest of places.
Obama	0	All of this has occurred in the midst of a city where No Irish Need Apply signs once hung from stores.
Obama	0	All of this in a city where, just thirty years ago, buses of black students were pelted with rocks as they pulled into schools in South Boston; where the Red Sox were once the team who refused to sign the great Jackie Robinson.
Obama	0	But the problem isn't that we've made progress.
Obama	0	The problem is that progress isn't good enough.
Obama	0	There is more work to be done, more justice to be had, more barriers to break.
Obama	0	And now it's your generation's turn to bring these changes about.
Obama	0	The last century was undoubtedly an American century.
Obama	0	Our victory over fascism and communism liberated millions.
Obama	0	At home, we built a shared prosperity that created the largest middle-class in history.
Obama	0	Ours was a nation of liberators; of free people; of prosperous people - and the world took notice.
Obama	0	But today, just a few years into the twenty-first century, we already find ourselves in a different and precarious position.
Obama	0	As revolutions in communications and technology have broken down barriers across the world, it has given more power to both our competitors and our enemies.
Obama	0	No longer can we assume that a high-school education in Boston is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.
Obama	0	No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.
Obama	0	Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.
Obama	0	So what does this mean for you?
Obama	0	What role will you play in meeting these challenges?
Obama	0	I do not pretend to have the answers.
Obama	0	Each of you will have to discover your own.
Obama	0	But perhaps I can offer a few suggestions that may be useful along the way.
Obama	0	First, take risks.
Obama	0	When I was on the brink of graduating from college, I had this crazy idea that I wanted to be a community organizer and work in low-income neighborhoods.
Obama	0	My mother and grandparents thought I should go to law school, and my friends were all busy applying for jobs on Wall Street.
Obama	0	But I went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that I thought was working to empower low-income people.
Obama	0	And finally, this small group of churches on the south side of Chicago wrote back and offered me a job helping them deal with the consequences of steel plants that had closed and put thousands out of work.
Obama	0	The churches didn't have much money - so they offered me a grand sum of $12,000 a year plus $1,000 to buy a car.
Obama	0	So I bought a beat up old car, packed up my belongings, got out a map, and started driving west to Chicago - a place I had never been and where I didn't know a living soul.
Obama	0	About halfway between New York City and Chicago, I stopped for the night in a small town in Pennsylvania whose name I no longer remember.
Obama	0	I found a motel that looked cheap and clean, I pulled into the driveway, and went to the counter, where there was an old guy doing crossword puzzles.
Obama	0	I asked him for a room, and as he was filling out my information, he asked me where I was headed.
Obama	0	I said I was going to Chicago, and I told him I was going there to work as a community organizer.
Obama	0	And he looked at me and he said, "You know, you look like a nice clean-cut young man, and you've got a nice voice.
Obama	0	So let me give you a piece of advice - forget this community organizing business.
Obama	0	You can't change the world, and people won't appreciate you trying.
Obama	0	What you should do is go into television broadcasting.
Obama	0	I'm telling you, you've got a future."
Obama	0	I could've taken my mother's advice and I could've taken my grandparents advice.
Obama	0	I could've taken the path my friends traveled.
Obama	0	And I could've taken the words of wisdom from that old man in Pennsylvania.
Obama	0	And, objectively speaking, I'm sure he was right.
Obama	0	But I knew there was something in me that wanted to try for something bigger.
Obama	0	So don't let people talk you into doing the safe thing.
Obama	0	Listen to what's in you and decide what it is that you care so much about that you're willing to take a chance.
Obama	0	My second piece of advice is to stay global.
Obama	0	As the world continues to change and we become more connected to each other, globalization will bring both benefits and disruptions to our lives.
Obama	0	But either way, it's here, and it's not going away.
Obama	0	We can try to build walls around us, and we can look inward, and we can respond by being frightened and angry about those disruptions.
Obama	0	But that's not what we're about.
Obama	0	We are a confident country, not a fearful one.
Obama	0	We can meet these challenges.
Obama	0	And that means every single one of us needs to learn more so we can compete more.
Obama	0	It means we need an energy policy that will create new jobs in this country and end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
Obama	0	And it means we need to update our social contract to make sure that people have health care and pensions and training no matter where they work or how many times they switch jobs.
Obama	0	But it doesn't mean we should ever withdrawal.
Obama	0	We are better than that.
Obama	0	My third piece of advice is to cultivate a sense of empathy - to put yourself in other people's shoes - to see the world from their eyes.
Obama	0	Empathy is a quality of character that can change the world - one that makes you understand that your obligations to others extend beyond people who look like you and act like you and live in your neighborhood.
Obama	0	I know that, especially on this campus, so many of you have been serving at homeless shelters and high schools and youth centers and job placement organizations all over the Boston area.
Obama	0	And I hope this spirit of service lives on long after you leave here.
Obama	0	But as you continue on in life, it's not always easy.
Obama	0	In the years to come, you will encounter all kinds of obstacles in the way of empathy.
Obama	0	You will find people who, out of fear or need for power, try to divide us and deny what we have in common.
Obama	0	You'll hear that the Americans who sleep in the streets and beg for food got there because they're all lazy or weak of spirit.
Obama	0	That the immigrants who risk their lives to cross a desert have nothing to contribute to this country and no desire to embrace our ideals.
Obama	0	That the inner-city children who are trapped in the nation's most dilapidated schools can't learn and won't learn and so we should just give up on them entirely.
Obama	0	That the innocent people being slaughtered and expelled from their homes half a world away are somebody else's problem to take care of.
Obama	0	You'll hear all of this, and you'll have to choose.
Obama	0	You'll have to decide where your obligations lie.
Obama	0	And let me tell you - the easiest thing in the world is to do nothing at all.
Obama	0	To turn off the TV, put down the paper, and walk away from the stories about Iraq or Darfur or poverty or violence or joblessness or hopelessness.
Obama	0	To go about your busy lives, wishing these problems away but expecting someone else to do it.
Obama	0	To remain detached; to remain indifferent; to remain safe.
Obama	0	But I hope you don't do what's easy.
Obama	0	I hope you do what's hard.
Obama	0	I often imagine the young Americans - teenagers and college kids not much older than you - from all over the country, watching the Civil Rights Movement unfold before them on their television sets.
Obama	0	I imagine that they would've seen the marchers and heard the speeches, but they also probably saw the dogs and the fire hoses, or the footage of innocent people being beaten within an inch of their lives, or maybe they would've heard the news the day those four little girls died when someone threw a bomb into their church.
Obama	0	Instinctively, they knew that it was safer and smarter to stay at home; to watch the movement from afar.
Obama	0	But somewhere in their hearts, they also understood that these people in Georgia and Alabama and Mississippi were their brothers and sisters; that what was happening was wrong; and that they had an obligation to make it right.
Obama	0	And so when the buses pulled up for a Freedom Ride down South, they got on.
Obama	0	And they rode.
Obama	0	Thousands of them.
Obama	0	And they changed the world.
Obama	0	We need you to do the same.
Obama	0	As Robert F. Kennedy once told a crowd of South Africans no older than you, "The world demands the qualities of youth; not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease."
Obama	0	Finally, my last piece of advice is to stay amazed - to remain in wonder at this unlikely place we call America.
Obama	0	I think it's easy for some people to look at all the challenges we face; to look at poverty and war and racism and inequality and hatred and helplessness, and to get down on this country as a result - to think that there's something wrong with us - that there is little hope to make things better.
Obama	0	And if you ever feel like that yourselves, I ask you to remember all the amazing and unlikely things that have happened in this country.
Obama	0	This country where a young man from Illinois who failed at so many of the business and political ventures he attempted still went on to become the president who freed a people and saved a union.
Obama	0	This country where a young black minister from Georgia who had nothing but a dream in his heart went on to lead his people to the promised land of civil rights and voting rights.
Obama	0	This country where hundreds of parents all over the world who never had the chance to further their education could still watch their children become the first in their family to earn a degree on a hopeful Boston day in June.
Obama	0	This is America.
Obama	0	A place where millions of restless adventurers from all over the world, still weary of their lot in life - still hoping for something better - have longed to travel great distances and take great risks for a chance to arrive on our shores.
Obama	0	My father was one of them.
Obama	0	Born and raised in Kenya before that nation was freed from the shackles of colonialism, he grew up herding his father's goats and, from time to time, attending local schools.
Obama	0	But he wanted more.
Obama	0	He dreamed of coming to America so he could further his education, improve his skills, and then return to help lead the next generation of newly independent Kenyans.
Obama	0	I didn't know my father very well.
Obama	0	My parents separated when I was very young.
Obama	0	But before I went to law school, I traveled back to Kenya to learn his story and to meet my relatives there.
Obama	0	And I went to a tiny village called Alego where my grandmother lives.
Obama	0	And I visited my father's grave and my grandfather's grave.
Obama	0	And I asked my grandmother if there was anything left from my father.
Obama	0	She opened a trunk and took out a stack of letters, which she handed to me.
Obama	0	There were more than thirty of them, all handwritten by my father, all addressed to colleges and universities all across America.
Obama	0	They were letters not so different than those I would write twenty-five years later, trying to find a job that would give meaning to my life.
Obama	0	And I read these letters, which were in the simple, sometimes awkward, voice of somebody desperate for a chance to come and live his unlikely dream.
Obama	0	It is because someone answered that dream that I stand before you today, hopeful for our collective future, excited for your individual prospects, and eager for you to keep the legacy of this country alive in the years to come.
Obama	0	You will be tested.
Obama	0	You won't always succeed.
Obama	0	But know that you have it within your power to try.
Obama	0	That generations who have come before you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time.
Obama	0	And that through our collective labor, and through God's providence, and our willingness to shoulder each other's burdens, America will continue on its journey towards that distant horizon, and a better day.
Obama	0	Thank you so much to the class of 2006, and congratulations on your graduation.
Obama	0	Floor Statement General Michael Hayden Nomination   TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense May 25, 2006 Senator Barack Obama Floor Statement General Michael Hayden Nomination Complete Text Mr. President.
Obama	0	Let me start by saying that General Hayden is extremely well qualified for this position.
Obama	0	Having previously served as head of the National Security Agency and as Deputy Director of National Intelligence under John Negroponte, he has thirty years of experience in intelligence and national security matters.
Obama	0	And he was nearly universally praised during his confirmation to deputy DNI.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, General Hayden is being nominated under troubling circumstances as the architect and chief defender of a program of wiretapping and collection of phone records outside of FISA oversight.
Obama	0	This is a program that is still accountable to no one and no law.
Obama	0	Now, there is no one in this Congress who doesn't want President Bush to have every tool at his disposal to prevent terrorist attacks - including the use of a surveillance program.
Obama	0	Every single American - Democrat and Republican -- who remembers the images of falling towers and needless death would gladly support increased surveillance to prevent another attack.
Obama	0	But over the last six months, Americans have learned that the National Security Agency has been spying on Americans without judicial approval.
Obama	0	We learned about this not from the Administration, but from the New York Times and USA Today.
Obama	0	Every time a revelation came out, President Bush refused to answer questions from Congress.
Obama	0	This is part of a general stance by this Administration that it can operate with no restraints.
Obama	0	President Bush is interpreting Article II of the Constitution as giving him authority with no bounds.
Obama	0	The Attorney General and a hand full of scholars agree with this view, and I don't doubt the sincerity with which the President and his lawyers believe this constitutional interpretation.
Obama	0	However, the overwhelming weight of legal authority is against the President on his unbounded authority without any checks or balances.
Obama	0	This is not how our Constitution is designed.
Obama	0	We don't expect the President to give the American people every detail about a classified surveillance program.
Obama	0	But we do expect him to place such a program within the rule of law, and to allow members of the other two coequal branches of government - Congress and the Judiciary - to have the ability to monitor and oversee such a program.
Obama	0	Our Constitution and our right to privacy as Americans require as much.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, we were never given the chance to make that examination.
Obama	0	Time and again, President Bush has refused to come clean to Congress.
Obama	0	Why was it that 14 of 16 members of the Intelligence Committee were kept in the dark for four and a half years?
Obama	0	The only reason that some Senators are now being briefed is because the story was made public.
Obama	0	Without that information it is impossible to make the decisions that allow us to balance the need to fight terrorism while still upholding the rule of law and privacy protections that make this country great.
Obama	0	Every democracy is tested when it is faced with a serious threat.
Obama	0	As a nation, we have to find the right balance between privacy and security, between executive authority to face threats and uncontrolled power.
Obama	0	What protects us, and what distinguishes us, are the procedures we put in place to protect that balance, namely judicial warrants and congressional review.
Obama	0	These aren't arbitrary ideas.
Obama	0	These are the concrete safeguards that make sure that surveillance hasn't gone too far.
Obama	0	That someone is watching the watchers.
Obama	0	The exact details of these safeguards are not etched in stone.
Obama	0	They can be reevaluated from time to time.
Obama	0	The last time we had a major overhaul of the intelligence apparatus was 30 years ago in the aftermath of Watergate.
Obama	0	After those dark days, the White House worked in a collaborative way with Congress through the Church Committee to study the issue, revise intelligence laws and set up a system of checks and balances.
Obama	0	It worked then and it could work now.
Obama	0	But unfortunately, this Administration has made no effort to reach out to Congress and tailor FISA.
Obama	0	I have no doubt that General Hayden will be confirmed.
Obama	0	But I am going to reluctantly vote against him to send a signal to this Administration that even in these circumstances President Bush is not above the law.
Obama	0	I am voting against Hayden in the hope that he will be more humble before the great weight of responsibility that he has, not only to protect our lives, but to protect our democracy.
Obama	0	Americans fought a Revolution in part over the right to be free from unreasonable searches - to ensure that our government couldn't come knocking in the middle of the night for no reason.
Obama	0	We need to find a way forward to make sure that we can stop terrorists while protecting the privacy, and liberty, of innocent Americans.
Obama	0	We have to find a way to give the President the power he needs to protect us, while making sure he doesn't abuse that power.
Obama	0	It is possible to do that.
Obama	0	We have done it before, we could do it again.
Obama	0	Floor Speech in Opposition to the Amendment Requiring a Photo ID   TOPIC: Civil Rights May 24, 2006 Senator Obama's Floor Speech Opposition to the Amendment Requiring a Photo ID Complete Text Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Obama	0	Let me just echo Senator Kennedy's strong opposition to the amendment that is offered by the Senator from Kentucky.
Obama	0	There is no more fundamental right accorded to United States citizens by the Constitution than the right to vote.
Obama	0	The unimpeded exercise of this right is essential to the functioning of our democracy.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, history has not been kind to certain citizens in protecting their ability to exercise this right.
Obama	0	For a large part of our nation's history, racial minorities have been prevented from voting because of barriers such as literacy tests, poll taxes and property requirements.
Obama	0	We've come a long way.
Obama	0	That was clear a few weeks ago when Democrats and Republicans, members of the Senate and the House stood on the Capitol steps to announce the introduction of a bill to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.
Obama	0	That rare and refreshing display of bipartisanship reflects our collective belief that more needs to be done to remove barriers to voting.
Obama	0	Right now, the Senate is finishing a historic debate about immigration reform.
Obama	0	It's been a difficult discussion, occasionally contentious.
Obama	0	It's required bipartisan cooperation.
Obama	0	After several weeks and many, many amendments, we're less than an hour away from voting for cloture.
Obama	0	Considering our progress and the delicate balance we're trying to maintain, this amendment could not come at a worse time.
Obama	0	Let's be clear.
Obama	0	This is a national voter ID law.
Obama	0	This is a national voter ID law that breaks the careful compromise struck by a 50-50 Senate four years ago.
Obama	0	It would be the most restrictive voter ID ever enacted, one that could quite literally result in millions of disenfranchised voters and utter chaos at the state level.
Obama	0	Now, I recognize there's a certain simplistic appeal to this amendment.
Obama	0	Why shouldn't we require people to have a voter ID card when they vote?
Obama	0	Don't we want to make sure voters are who they claim to be?
Obama	0	And shouldn't we make sure non-citizens are casting ballots to change the outcome of elections?
Obama	0	There are two problems with the argument: number one, there's been no showing that there's any significant problem with voter fraud in the 50 states.
Obama	0	There certainly is no showing that non-citizens are rushing to try to vote: this is a solution in search of a problem.
Obama	0	The second problem is that historically disenfranchised groups - minorities, the poor, the elderly and the disabled - are most affected by photo ID laws.
Obama	0	Let me give you a few statistics, overall 12% of voting age American do not have a driver's license, most of whom are minority, new U.S. citizens, the indigent, the elderly or the disabled.
Obama	0	AARP reports that 3.6 million disabled Americans have no driver's license.
Obama	0	A recent study in Wisconsin this year found that white adults were twice as likely to have driver's licenses as African Americans over 18.
Obama	0	In Louisiana, African Americans are four to five times less likely to have photo IDs than white residents.
Obama	0	Now, why won't poor people be able to get photo IDs or Real IDs?
Obama	0	It's simple.
Obama	0	Because they cost money.
Obama	0	You need a birth certificate, passport or proof naturalization and that can cost up to $85.
Obama	0	Then you need to go to the state office to apply for a card.
Obama	0	That requires time off work, possibly a long trip on public transportation assuming there's an office near you.
Obama	0	Imagine if you only vote once ever two or four years, it's not very likely you'll take time off work, take a bus to pay $85 just so you can vote.
Obama	0	That is not something that most folks are going to be able to do.
Obama	0	The fact of the matter, Mr. President, is that this is an idea that has been batted around not with respect to immigration but with respect to generally attempting to restrict the approach for people voting throughout the country.
Obama	0	This is not the time to do it.
Obama	0	The Carter-Baker commission in 2002-2004 said fraudulent votes make up .000003% of the votes cast.
Obama	0	That's a lot of zeros.
Obama	0	Let me say it a different way.
Obama	0	Out of almost 200 million votes that were cast during these elections, 52 were fraudulent.
Obama	0	To put that into some context, you are statistically more likely to get killed by lightning than to find a fraudulent vote in a federal election.
Obama	0	Mr. President, this is not the appropriate time to be debating this kind of amendment.
Obama	0	We've got a lot of serious issues with respect to immigration.
Obama	0	I would ask that all my colleagues reject the amendment so we can move on to the important business at hand.
Obama	0	Thank you, Mr. President.
Obama	0	Floor Statement - Employment Verification Amendment  TOPIC: Immigration May 23, 2006 Floor Statement by Senator Barack Obama Employment Verification Amendment for the Immigration Bill Complete Text Mr. President.
Obama	0	I come to the floor today to discuss the bipartisan employment verification system amendment that Senators Grassley, Kennedy, Kyl, and I have introduced.
Obama	0	One of the central components of immigration reform is enforcement, and this bill contains a number of important provisions to beef up border security.
Obama	0	But that's not enough.
Obama	0	Real enforcement also means drying up the pool of jobs that encourages illegal immigration.
Obama	0	And that can only happen if employers don't hire illegal workers.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, our current employer enforcement system does little to nothing to deter illegal immigrants from finding work.
Obama	0	Overall, the number of workplace arrests of illegal immigrants fell from 17,552 in 1997 to 451 in 2002, even as illegal immigration grew during that time.
Obama	0	Moreover, between 25% to 40% of all undocumented immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas.
Obama	0	And the only way to effectively deter overstays is to reduce access to employment.
Obama	0	When Congress last passed an immigration bill in 1986, we didn't provide a meaningful way for employers to check legal eligibility to work.
Obama	0	Currently, employees can prove their legal status by showing a variety of documents, and employers are supposed to record their inspection of such documents by filling out an I-9 form for each employee.
Obama	0	As a result, the market for fraudulent documents -- fake Social Security cards, driver's licenses, birth certificates - has exploded.
Obama	0	But, with more than 100 million employees in more than 6 million workplaces, and only about 788 Wage and Hour investigators, employer sanctions have become merely a nuisance requirement to maintain records, not a serious risk of penalties.
Obama	0	As a result, the number of "intent to fine" notices issued to employers for hiring undocumented workers dropped from 417 in 1999 to just three in 2004.
Obama	0	Understandably, employers cannot always detect forged documents.
Obama	0	And employers who reject workers with questionable documents risk an employment discrimination suit.
Obama	0	That's why we need a better alternative.
Obama	0	We need an electronic verification system that can effectively detect the use of fraudulent documents, significantly reduce the employment of illegal workers, and give employers the confidence that their workforce is legal.
Obama	0	When Congress first considered comprehensive immigration reform in April, the legislation on the floor addressed this problem by creating a national employment eligibility verification system.
Obama	0	Senators Grassley, Kyl, and I all thought that was a good idea in theory, but we had concerns with the design of the system.
Obama	0	Senators Grassley and Kyl proposed that the verification system be implemented nationally within 18 months.
Obama	0	Senators Kennedy and I proposed that the system be phased in over five years but that it also include additional accuracy and privacy standards, as well as strict prohibitions on use of the system to discriminate against workers.
Obama	0	For the past few weeks, our staffs have worked together in a bipartisan effort to negotiate a substitute that took the concerns of both proposals into consideration.
Obama	0	I'm pleased that we've reached an agreement.
Obama	0	Under our compromise amendment, all employers would have to participate 18 months after the Department of Homeland Security receives the appropriations needed to fund the system.
Obama	0	All new employees hired would have to be run through the system, and a series of privacy and accuracy standards would protect citizens and legal immigrants from errors in the system and breaches of private information.
Obama	0	And to make sure that employers take the system seriously, we strengthen civil penalties for employers who hire unauthorized workers, and we establish criminal penalties for repeat violators.
Obama	0	We've worked in a constructive, bipartisan manner to design an employment verification system that is fair to legal workers and tough on illegal workers.
Obama	0	This is a good amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Southern Illinois University School of Medicine Commencement  TOPIC: Commencement and Healthcare & Health Issues May 20, 2006 Southern Illinois University School of Medicine Commencement Address Complete Text Congratulations!
Obama	0	After four long years of endless work, sleepless nights, and constant stress, you can finally look forward to three years of even more work, less sleep, and stress that may tempt you to self-prescribe.
Obama	0	But hey, at least there's June!
Obama	0	Of course, you knew all of this coming in.
Obama	0	You understood the sacrifices involved and the commitment necessary to become a doctor.
Obama	0	You were aware that it would take years of your life and leave you with significant debt.
Obama	0	And yet, you signed up anyway.
Obama	0	You chose this profession because you heard a calling; and in answering that call revealed that you don't just see this as a profession.
Obama	0	From now on, doctor won't just be a title you'll hold, it will be a part of who you are - a healer, a saver of life.
Obama	0	And no matter where you may be or what situation you may find yourself, you will forever come forward at the first sound of the question, "Is there a doctor in the house?"
Obama	0	This is a good thing.
Obama	0	I mention it not to add to the burdens that must already weigh heavily on your shoulders, but to point out that your distinct commitment and compassion for the lives of your fellow human beings is a quality that has intrinsic value far outside the doctor's office or the operating room.
Obama	0	And it is because of this quality that I want to ask something of you.
Obama	0	Life often happens in a way that makes it easy for us to miss the larger obligations we have toward one another.
Obama	0	The demands of work and time and money tend to narrow our focus and cause us to turn inward.
Obama	0	You might flip on the news or pick up the paper and feel moved by a story about genocide in Darfur or the AIDS epidemic or the fifteen-year-old who was gunned down in front of his house.
Obama	0	You may even feel compelled to do something about it.
Obama	0	But inevitably, it becomes time to study, or go to work, or cook dinner, or put the kids to bed - and so we often turn away from the big stuff and concentrate on simply surviving the small.
Obama	0	This is perfectly human.
Obama	0	It is perfectly understandable.
Obama	0	And yet, the survival of our country has always required more.
Obama	0	It has required ordinary men and women to look beyond their own lives; to think about the larger challenges we face as a people - and then rise to meet them.
Obama	0	This is what I'd like to ask you to do today.
Obama	0	In a few months, your residencies will begin.
Obama	0	And on a daily basis, you will encounter patients with every disease and ailment imaginable.
Obama	0	There will be heart problems and lung problems; common colds and deadly flus; broken bones and painful diagnoses.
Obama	0	But after being there for awhile, you will encounter another, more pervasive affliction that affects more than just individual patients.
Obama	0	Perhaps you will first notice it when a doctor tells a woman that her husband will need a life-saving procedure that their insurance will not cover and their family cannot afford.
Obama	0	Perhaps it will be the late-stage diagnosis of a cancer that could have been prevented with a routine screening that the patient's health care plan just doesn't cover.
Obama	0	Perhaps it will be the endless stream of people who wait and wait in an Emergency Room which is the only place that will treat the uninsured.
Obama	0	At some point in your residency, you'll see firsthand that there is something fundamentally broken about our health care system.
Obama	0	You'll realize that for millions upon millions of Americans, the care you provide is becoming far too costly for them to afford.
Obama	0	And you'll have to decide what, if anything, you're going to do about it.
Obama	0	You've all heard the statistics - 46 million Americans uninsured.
Obama	0	5 million more in just the last four years.
Obama	0	Family premiums up 65%.
Obama	0	Deductibles up 50%.
Obama	0	It's a cost crisis that traps us all in a vicious cycle.
Obama	0	Because the uninsured can't afford health care, they put off seeing a doctor or end up in the ER when they get sick.
Obama	0	Then their care is more expensive, and so premiums for all Americans go up.
Obama	0	Because everyone's premiums go up, more Americans lose their health care.
Obama	0	From the smallest mom and pop stores to major corporations like GM, businesses who can't afford these rising costs are cutting back on insurance, workers, or both.
Obama	0	States with bigger Medicaid bills and smaller budgets are being forced to choose whether they want their citizens to be unhealthy or uneducated.
Obama	0	And over half of all family bankruptcies today are caused by medical bills.
Obama	0	This is affecting your profession too.
Obama	0	Whether it's Medicaid reimbursements, the rising price of medical malpractice insurance, or having HMOs look over your shoulder, all the hard work and sacrifice you've put in during medical school is becoming less rewarding than it once was.
Obama	0	And so today I ask you to be more than just practitioners of medicine; I ask you to be advocates for medicine.
Obama	0	I ask you to be advocates for a health care system that is fair, that is just, and that provides every single American with the best your profession has to offer.
Obama	0	Just like generations before, you must dare to believe - not only as tomorrow's physicians, but as tomorrow's parents, workers, business owners, and citizens.
Obama	0	You must choose: Will the medical miracles you perform over the next generation reach only the luckiest few?
Obama	0	Or will history look back at this moment as the time when we finally made care available at a cost that we can afford?
Obama	0	There isn't one person sitting here today who wants to turn a sick patient away because they can't pay.
Obama	0	Not one person who wants the care they deliver denied to those whose lives depend on it.
Obama	0	Each of you has dedicated yourselves to this calling because where there is a sick person, you want to heal them.
Obama	0	Where there is a life in jeopardy, you want to save it.
Obama	0	And so today, when you leave here, it will not only be with great knowledge, but with even greater responsibility.
Obama	0	Because if we do nothing about the rising cost of health care, it will keep climbing, and in ten years, the number of uninsured could grow to 54 million.
Obama	0	We can solve this problem.
Obama	0	Challenging as it may seem, all over America there are already business owners and political leaders and labor representatives and members of the medical profession who are coming up with new and different ways to cut costs and improve quality in our health care system.
Obama	0	In Massachusetts, they just signed into law a groundbreaking plan that would cover most all of its citizens.
Obama	0	This can be our future, but everyone needs to stay involved, and everyone needs to put the pressure on Washington, because they sure won't do it on their own.
Obama	0	Just a little while ago, we were told that it was "Health Care Week" in the U.S. Senate.
Obama	0	Five days later, we had failed to debate even a single bill that would have fundamentally improved access for the 46 million Americans without health insurance.
Obama	0	This is why we need you.
Obama	0	We need you to dream, we need you to speak out, and we need you to act.
Obama	0	And together, we can build a health care system in this country that finally works for every American.
Obama	0	We can have a system where no matter how many times you switch jobs or how large or small your employer is, you have a health care plan that stays with you forever.
Obama	0	We can have a system that reduces medical error and cuts costs by using 21st century technology to put all of our medical information online.
Obama	0	A system where every doctor and nurse can sit by a patient's bedside with a laptop and pull up their entire medical history with the click of a mouse.
Obama	0	Where every patient has an electronic bracelet that you could scan to find out the exact type and amount of medication they needed so there are no mistakes made.
Obama	0	Where you could go online and monitor a patient's breathing and heart rate while they were home to track their recovery.
Obama	0	We can have a system of evidence-based health care that shares information about what works and what doesn't, so we can actually provide patients with the care they need when they need it.
Obama	0	And we can have a health care system where we focus on preventing deadly and costly illnesses before they occur - where we ensure that every American has routine check-ups and screenings and information about how to live a healthy lifestyle.
Obama	0	We can do all of this - but we need your help to get it done.
Obama	0	Of course, no one's forcing you to meet these challenges.
Obama	0	Each of you has been blessed with extraordinary gifts and talent.
Obama	0	And so if you want, you can leave here and focus on your own medical career and your own success, not giving another thought to the plight of the growing millions who can't afford the care you will provide.
Obama	0	After all, there is no community service requirement in the real world; and no one's forcing you to care.
Obama	0	But I hope that you do.
Obama	0	Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.
Obama	0	Not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation.
Obama	0	You need to take on the challenges that your country is facing because you have an obligation to yourself.
Obama	0	Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation.
Obama	0	Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential.
Obama	0	Looking out at this class of 2006, I think my hope is well-placed.
Obama	0	With the field you have chosen, you've already shown how much you care about the lives of others; how strongly you have heard the calling to be healers in this world.
Obama	0	Today, I ask you to remember that call always, and to remember how it could include more than the patient sitting in your office.
Obama	0	It could also include the patients who can't afford to get there, the ones who aren't being provided the best care, and the general health of all Americans.
Obama	0	When you think about these challenges, I also ask you to remember that in this country, our history of overcoming the seemingly impossible always comes about because individuals who care really can make a difference.
Obama	0	A century ago, who would have dared to believe that in just one hundred years, we would add thirty years to the average lifespan and witness a 90% drop in the rate of infant death?
Obama	0	Who would have dared to believe that with a simple vaccine, we could eliminate a disease that left millions without the ability to walk?
Obama	0	That we could transplant a heart or resuscitate one that stopped?
Obama	0	That we could unlock the greatest mysteries of life from the most basic building blocks of our existence?
Obama	0	In a time where you were lucky to live past fifty and doomed if you came down with the flu, who would have dared to believe these things?
Obama	0	The people who once sat in your position - they did.
Obama	0	The doctors and nurses, researchers and scientists who came before.
Obama	0	Who grew up believing that in America, the most improbable of all experiments, the place where we continue to defy the odds and write our own history, that they could be the ones to improve, extend, and save human life.
Obama	0	That they could be the healers.
Obama	0	And as you go forth from here in your own life, you can keep this history alive if you only find the courage to try.
Obama	0	Good luck with this journey, and congratulations on all of your achievements.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Honoring Our Commitment to Veterans - Podcast - Transcript  TOPIC: Veterans May 18, 2006 Honoring Our Commitment to Veterans Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama and today is Thursday, May 18th, 2006.
Obama	0	We've been having some big debates here in Washington; obviously Iraq and Iran are still high on the list.
Obama	0	We've also been immersed in the immigration bill, which is actually making more progress than I had expected.
Obama	0	I'll be frank with you - I was concerned that after negotiations broke down that we were not going to be able to get a bill out of the Senate.
Obama	0	I think, actually, at this point that we may get a comprehensive bill out of the Senate, then the challenge is going to be making sure that we're able to negotiate with House members to reconcile differences and ensure that we've got a piece of legislation that both deals with border security, ensures that employers have to verify the employment status of their employees, and also gives a pathway to citizenship to the 11 to 12 million people who are already here but undocumented.
Obama	0	But I want to just shift gears today.
Obama	0	This is an issue that is important to an awful lot of people in Illinois, its also important to a lot of people in states around the country.
Obama	0	Some of you may recall, if you've been following the work that we've been doing, that I'm on the Veterans Affairs Committee and however you feel about the war in Iraq, however you feel about past wars, I think all of us, Republican, Democrat, urban, rural, whatever your demographic, should share in the belief that when a young man or woman goes off and serves our country in the military, that they should be treated with the utmost dignity and respect when they come home.
Obama	0	That should especially be true for those who have suffered disabilities on the battlefield.
Obama	0	Anybody who's ever visited Walter Reed Hospital here in Washington and has seen twenty year-olds and twenty-two year-olds who have had legs amputated or suffered severe nerve damage I think understands they have made an unbelievable sacrifice on our behalf and that we've got an obligation to make sure that just as they are fighting on our behalf that we are going to make sure that we fight for their behalf when they come home.
Obama	0	It turned out that a number of veterans in states including Illinois had been apparently short-changed in terms of their disability payments.
Obama	0	Typically, veterans who've been injured receive some sort of disability payment.
Obama	0	They are evaluated by various regional offices of Veterans Affairs, and they are awarded a certain percentage based on the kind of injury they've received and the severity of the injury.
Obama	0	It turns out that in Illinois, for a wide range of reasons, you had veterans who had been injured getting paid much lower disability payments than veterans in some other states - and these differences were substantial.
Obama	0	Illinois veterans, for example, were receiving 42 percent less per year than some of the leading states.
Obama	0	So, to give you an example, an average disability payment to Illinois veterans would be $6,961.
Obama	0	In New Mexico, the top ranked state - same veteran, same disability - on average, was getting $12,000 a year.
Obama	0	So, obviously this wasn't acceptable to me as a senator from Illinois, but it was unacceptable, I think, to anybody who believes that any veteran who has served our country, wherever they live, should be treated fairly and equitably.
Obama	0	As a consequence, we've moved forward and passed legislation last year ensuring that, in fact, some of these differentials were dealt with.
Obama	0	We asked the VA to come to Illinois and other states that had suffered some of these problems and made sure that, in fact, they started assigning and retraining some of the people who were doing the evaluations.
Obama	0	The other thing is we insisted that the Veterans Administration do outreach to people who have received disability payments all these years and may have been short-changed.
Obama	0	And so what happened is starting this month, you had the Department of Veterans Affairs sending out letters to disabled veterans in Illinois and several other states indicating to them that they live in a state that has received low average disability compensation and that they have the right to open new claims, appeal what a veteran may consider to be a bad decision, to get help from veterans service organizations, in terms of processing these reevaluations that have been requested.
Obama	0	And so today I just wanted to make sure that veterans were aware of this.
Obama	0	I hope that we've got some veterans on the podcast who may have been disabled and are receiving benefits.
Obama	0	If you live in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Connecticut, Ohio or New Jersey, than you live in a state in which the average disability payment is substantially lower than payments to disabled veterans in other states.
Obama	0	It doesn't mean that your individual payment is necessarily too low; it may have been that you actually were treated fairly by the VA, but there is a possibility that because you live in one of these states (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Connecticut, Ohio or New Jersey) that, in fact, you were getting a lower disability payment than you should have received.
Obama	0	The VA should have sent a letter to you to contact you, to give you an opportunity to have your claim reevaluated and if you have not received a letter but you are a disabled veteran that was awarded a disability payment in one of those states, then you can call 1-800-827-1000.
Obama	0	That's 1-800-827-1000, or you can get on the following website: www.vba.va.gov/specialoutreach.
Obama	0	I know that's a mouthful, so what you can do is get on our website and we will post on the website, the VA website that is designed to do this outreach.
Obama	0	I hope that all of you take a look at this if you are a disabled veteran because we want to make sure that you have been treated fairly by the VA. And for those of you who aren't veterans, I hope that you will continue to be supportive of our veterans.
Obama	0	Many of them have a very difficult time adjusting when they first come back home.
Obama	0	I think any of us who can imagine being on the battlefield in a place like Baghdad, perhaps seeing one of your friends injured or killed, seeing yourself lose a leg or an arm, experiencing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, you can only imagine the difficulties in making the adjustment to civilian life.
Obama	0	In fact, one of the things that I'm going to be monitoring very closely is how are we treating the 100,000 plus veterans who are going to be coming home and to make sure the VA has the capacity to provide transition services for veterans who are leaving the service and reentering civilian life, particularly National Guardsmen and Reservists who perhaps did not expect to be fighting in a place like Iraq.
Obama	0	It turns out that if you catch a veteran and provide them good services on the way out, they are much less likely to suffer Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and can make the adjustment.
Obama	0	If some of the problems they may have as a consequence of being on the battlefield are not dealt with early, then they can have long-term problems, which is one of the reasons why veterans are seven times more likely to be homeless than non-veterans.
Obama	0	So, that's an amazing statistic to think about.
Obama	0	It indicates the enormous toll that war, of any sort, can take on our young men and women.
Obama	0	It's also a reminder for those of us who are in civilian life but have the authority to authorize war do so with a great sense of responsibility and caution.
Obama	0	Anyway, it's great to talk to you guys as always.
Obama	0	I will be back on this podcast next week.
Obama	0	In the meantime, I hope everybody will continue to monitor this immigration debate.
Obama	0	I may have something more to say about it next week.
Obama	0	In the meantime, I hope everybody will continue to monitor this immigration debate.
Obama	0	I may have something more to say about it next week.
Obama	0	Bye-bye.
Obama	0	EMILY'S List Annual Luncheon - Women in Politics  TOPIC: Civil Rights May 11, 2006 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Emily's List Annual Luncheon Complete Text Thank you for inviting me here today and thank you to EMILY's List for all you've done to forever change the face of women in politics.
Obama	0	Your efforts haven't just sent women to Congress, you've sent champions - champions for the right to choose, for the right to equality, for the millions of women who ask only that their voices are heard too.
Obama	0	And we all owe the biggest thanks to the woman who hasn't just believed in that change, but who's done more to actually affect it, who's helped send more Democratic women to Congress over the last two decades than anyone in politics today.
Obama	0	Ellen Malcolm, we are in debt to you, we are in awe of you, and we continue to be inspired by your example and your commitment to women everywhere.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	We meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history.
Obama	0	It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
Obama	0	Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.
Obama	0	These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.
Obama	0	These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.
Obama	0	I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race.
Obama	0	A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running.
Obama	0	Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.
Obama	0	And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.
Obama	0	I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature.
Obama	0	And everywhere I went I'd get two questions: First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?"
Obama	0	Because people just couldn't pronounce it.
Obama	0	They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama."
Obama	0	And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
Obama	0	And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.
Obama	0	You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
Obama	0	And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.
Obama	0	That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.
Obama	0	So I understand the cynicism.
Obama	0	But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate.
Obama	0	We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago.
Obama	0	And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
Obama	0	And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked.
Obama	0	And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old.
Obama	0	And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who came all the way to this rally, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
Obama	0	I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky.
Obama	0	That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, at a time for black folks when lynchings were common, but voting was forbidden.
Obama	0	I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war.
Obama	0	I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote.
Obama	0	How she watched FDR lift this nation out of its own fear.
Obama	0	How she saw unions rise up and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America.
Obama	0	She believed in this idea and she saw all this progress and she had faith that someday it would be her turn.
Obama	0	And when she finally saw hope break through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
Obama	0	And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
Obama	0	And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.
Obama	0	She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed.
Obama	0	She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.
Obama	0	She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.
Obama	0	And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused.
Obama	0	Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are.
Obama	0	Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.
Obama	0	And I think that we face one of those moments today.
Obama	0	In a century just five years old, our faith has already been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
Obama	0	The world has changed.
Obama	0	No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.
Obama	0	No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.
Obama	0	Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.
Obama	0	But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still.
Obama	0	Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.
Obama	0	It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now.
Obama	0	The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away.
Obama	0	That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams.
Obama	0	That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the more than 2,300 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
Obama	0	Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore.
Obama	0	You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at an Emily's List luncheon, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks back.
Obama	0	He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words: Had enough?
Obama	0	I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here.
Obama	0	Because I think we've all had enough.
Obama	0	Enough of the broken promises.
Obama	0	Enough of the failed leadership.
Obama	0	Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance.
Obama	0	Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
Obama	0	I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
Obama	0	I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans.
Obama	0	I've had enough of that.
Obama	0	I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
Obama	0	I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers.
Obama	0	I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers.
Obama	0	And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
Obama	0	You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building.
Obama	0	We just didn't know he was talking about this one.
Obama	0	So yes, I've had enough.
Obama	0	And if you've had enough too, then we got some work to do.
Obama	0	If you've had enough, then we have some checks to write, and some calls to make, and some doors to knock on.
Obama	0	And if we do this, then in November, we're gonna have a U.S. House with people like Tammy Duckworth in it, and Melissa Bean, and Betty Sutton, and Dianne Farrell and Lois Murphy.
Obama	0	And we're gonna have a U.S. Senate with Amy Klobuchar and Claire McCaskill and Maria Cantwell and Debbie Stabenow.
Obama	0	And we're gonna change business-as-usual in Washington, and we're gonna set this country in a new direction.
Obama	0	Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man.
Obama	0	I think he loves his country.
Obama	0	I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.
Obama	0	The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is.
Obama	0	It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.
Obama	0	The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
Obama	0	That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...
Obama	0	It's called the Ownership Society in Washington.
Obama	0	But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
Obama	0	It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
Obama	0	It's a bracing idea.
Obama	0	It's a tempting idea.
Obama	0	And it's the easiest thing in the world.
Obama	0	But there's just one problem.
Obama	0	It doesn't work.
Obama	0	It ignores our history.
Obama	0	Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.
Obama	0	But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility.
Obama	0	The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
Obama	0	Americans know this.
Obama	0	We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
Obama	0	But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own.
Obama	0	We know that there are some things we do better together.
Obama	0	We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
Obama	0	That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.
Obama	0	That's what America is.
Obama	0	And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
Obama	0	Because I think that this is our moment to lead.
Obama	0	The time for our party's identity crisis is over.
Obama	0	Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves.
Obama	0	We know who we are and we know what our legacy is.
Obama	0	We're the party of Jefferson who first believed that every child in America should be educated regardless of wealth and birth and circumstance.
Obama	0	That's who we are.
Obama	0	We're the party of Roosevelt who lifted this nation out of its own fear and sent workers to the factories and veterans to college and families to new homes and seniors to a comfortable retirement.
Obama	0	That's who we are.
Obama	0	We're the party that stood up to fascism and defended freedom across the globe during World War II.
Obama	0	We're the party of civil rights, and workers' rights, and women's rights who believes that that every member of the American family deserves a shot at the American Dream.
Obama	0	That's who we are.
Obama	0	We're the party of new frontiers and bold horizons - the party that put man on the moon and fueled the research that unlocked the secrets of the human genome.
Obama	0	That's who we are.
Obama	0	And let me tell you about the party I see in the future.
Obama	0	In a globalized economy with bigger risks and greater rewards - a world where we are at once more connected and more competitive - let it be said that we are the party of opportunity.
Obama	0	The party that guarantees every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
Obama	0	Let it be said that we are the party that equips every worker with what they need to succeed in a 21st century economy - wage supports and pensions, child care and health care that will stay with them no matter where they work or what they do.
Obama	0	Let it be said that we are the party of innovation and discovery - willing to blaze a trail toward energy independence or invest in the research that could create whole new industries and save thousands of lives.
Obama	0	And in a world where evil lurks and terrorists plot, let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that matches the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy.
Obama	0	And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
Obama	0	If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.
Obama	0	Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans.
Obama	0	We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
Obama	0	Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership.
Obama	0	They are longing for direction.
Obama	0	And they want to believe again.
Obama	0	You know, as I was thinking about today's luncheon and all the progress EMILY's List has made over the years, the first thing that came to mind wasn't all the politics or the campaigns; it wasn't even all the issues debated or the legislation passed.
Obama	0	I thought about my daughters.
Obama	0	I thought about the world that Sasha and Malia will grow up in, about the chances they'll have and the challenges they'll face.
Obama	0	And I thought about my hopes for them - that they'll be able to dream without limit, achieve without constraint, and be free to seek their own happiness.
Obama	0	And I wondered - if they are lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if they someday have the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will they see?
Obama	0	Will they see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one they grew up in?
Obama	0	Will they see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?
Obama	0	Will all her of my hopes for my girls be fulfilled?
Obama	0	We are here today because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
Obama	0	We are here because we believe that this is our time.
Obama	0	Our time to make a mark on history.
Obama	0	Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.
Obama	0	And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
Obama	0	They can say that this was the time when America found its way.
Obama	0	They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Real Solution for High Gas Prices - Podcast - Transcript  TOPIC: Oil & Alternative Fuels May 11, 2006 A Real Solution for High Gas Prices Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama and today is Thursday, May 11, 2006.
Obama	0	The other day I went to the gas station.
Obama	0	Gas was $3.08 a gallon in the station where I stopped.
Obama	0	It is rough on Americans across the country right now.
Obama	0	Chicago has some of the highest gasoline prices in the country.
Obama	0	I'm fortunate that I am able to afford spending $50 on a tank of gas; there are a lot of families out there that can't.
Obama	0	People who have to drive to work long distances, people who don't have the money to buy more fuel-efficient cars right now and they've seen their standard of living drop substantially as a consequence of higher gas prices.
Obama	0	Now, the only thing as predictable as rising gas prices are the short-term political solutions that usually come along with them.
Obama	0	Every year you had the same headlines, "Pain at the Pump" and then Americans start emptying their wallets to fill up their tanks and politicians go through the standard responses: tax rebates and tax holidays, investigating price-gauging bio-oil companies.
Obama	0	None of these proposals are going to do any harm.
Obama	0	Some will provide Americans temporary relief at the pump, but, in the long term, we can't keep on relying solely on quick fixes designed to placate an anxious public.
Obama	0	We need proactive solutions that are designed to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and bring down prices for good.
Obama	0	Washington privately understands this but perhaps because of the influence of the oil companies, some of it having to do with ideology, Washington has just been unwilling to take the hard steps necessary to confront what I consider to be one of the most pressing economic and national security challenges in the 21st century.
Obama	0	So, the time for excuses is over.
Obama	0	Now's not the moment where we should be afraid of what is going to seem politically difficult or controversial.
Obama	0	Now's the time to call for innovation and sacrifice from those institutions that can make a difference: the auto industry, the oil industry, the federal government.
Obama	0	The first place to start is with cars.
Obama	0	We've got to build cars that use less gasoline.
Obama	0	The auto industry hasn't been asked to raise fuel-economy standards in seventeen years and frankly, lately Republicans and Democrats seem to have stopped asking.
Obama	0	Today, we've got no choice.
Obama	0	Starting in 2008, we should raise CAFE standards (that's the fuel-efficiency standards on cars) a modest 3 percent a year.
Obama	0	If we did that over the next 12 years, by 2020 passenger vehicles would average 40 miles per gallon, light trucks would average 32 miles per gallon.
Obama	0	That's not a dramatic increase; it's easily achievable through existing technology and it can be done without compromising passenger safety.
Obama	0	Now, there are going to be transition costs involved in making more fuel-efficient automobiles, especially for Detroit, which has relied heavily on the sale of SUVs for its profits.
Obama	0	So I've proposed what I call the "Healthcare for Hybrids" bill, where we'd strike a grand bargain with U.S. auto-makers.
Obama	0	We tell them we're going to pickup part of the tab for the retiree healthcare costs, a tab which, by the way, ran 6.7 billion dollars last year but, in exchange, you've got to use the money to invest in transitioning to fuel-efficient cars.
Obama	0	So that would be point number one.
Obama	0	Point number two: we should just replace the use of oil altogether as America's fuel of choice.
Obama	0	This doesn't mean singing the praises of ethanol, and hoping that it finds its way into our fuel supply on its own.
Obama	0	It means taking some serious steps now to put a national bio-fuel infrastructure into place.
Obama	0	Already some cars on the road have flexible fuel tanks necessary for them to run on E85, which is a cheaper, cleaner blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline.
Obama	0	But millions upon millions of cars still don't have these tanks.
Obama	0	So its time for auto-makers to install those tanks in every single car that they make and the government can help cover this small cost which currently runs at just around $100 per car.
Obama	0	It's also time to start making E85 fueling stations more available to the American public.
Obama	0	Currently only 681 out of the 170,000 fueling stations in America offer E85 pumps.
Obama	0	That's not acceptable.
Obama	0	Every American should have the choice when they pull up to fill up their car with E85.
Obama	0	That should be true at any fueling station and the oil companies should stop standing in the way and join us in making this happen.
Obama	0	If the big oil companies would devote just one percent of their first quarter profits this year to install E85 pumps, more than 7,000 service stations would be able to serve E85 to motorists who could use it.
Obama	0	Finally, we need to reduce the risk of investing in renewable fuels by providing loan guarantees and venture capital to those entrepreneurs with the best plans to develop cell-bio fuel and we should start creating a market for renewable fuels by ramping up the renewable fuel standard and creating an alternative diesel standard in this country, a national standard, that together would blend 65 billion gallons of renewable fuels into the petroleum supply every year.
Obama	0	If we had taken all these steps decades ago, like Brazil did when the call for energy independence was first issued, we'd be immune right now to the whims of oil-rich dictators and surging gas prices.
Obama	0	If we don't take these steps now there's going to be a day when we look back at that $3.05 or $3.15 gasoline as the good old days.
Obama	0	At some point there's not going to be a tax rebate that's big enough or a tax holiday that's long enough to solve these problems.
Obama	0	The American people shouldn't have to wait for this day to come.
Obama	0	When it comes to reducing our dependence of foreign oil, the resources are there, the technology is there, the demand is there.
Obama	0	Now we just need a little bit of political will and I hope that you guys will help me provide it.
Obama	0	Thanks for downloading and listening to the podcast.
Obama	0	I will talk to you soon.
Obama	0	Bye-bye.
Obama	0	Immigration Rallies and Status of Reform - Podcast Transcript  TOPIC: Immigration May 4, 2006 Immigration Rallies Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama and today is Thursday, May 4th, 2006.
Obama	0	On Monday, I traveled from D.C. to Chicago to witness a monumental event.
Obama	0	There were 400,000 people marching on behalf of comprehensive immigration reform in this country.
Obama	0	There were rallies all across the country but Chicago was one of the largest.
Obama	0	I had the opportunity to speak to the people who were gathering at Union Park before they marched over to Grant Park.
Obama	0	Four-hundred thousand people, mostly of Mexican origin, but large numbers of people from other countries - Nigerians and Pakistanis and Indians and Filipinos - people who've come to this country for the same reason that immigrants have been drawn to this country for generations: the notion that they can pursue and better life for themselves but, most importantly, for their children, if they work hard and apply themselves.
Obama	0	I think most of you are familiar with the issues that have surrounded immigration.
Obama	0	They've gotten a lot of attention recently.
Obama	0	We have a system of legal immigration in which people are drawn through the normal processes and they apply for legal residency and ultimately get naturalized as citizens if they so choose.
Obama	0	The controversy right now surrounds undocumented workers - people who came here illegally, most of them crossing the border between Mexico and the United States.
Obama	0	It's estimated at this point that we probably have 11 to 12 million undocumented workers around the country.
Obama	0	Most of them are employed in low-wage backbreaking work in agricultural sectors, in packing plants, in restaurants, in construction.
Obama	0	Obviously, the country feels ambivalent about this influx.
Obama	0	On the one hand, I think many of us (including myself) believe that these people are doing what any of us would do if we had an opportunity for a better life for our kids.
Obama	0	They take the risk of coming here; many of them are extraordinarily impoverished and would not likely be able to get to the United States through the limited number of visas that are currently issued.
Obama	0	On the other hand, we are a nation of laws and these people did come here outside of the law.
Obama	0	Economists debate what kind of effect undocumented workers have in this country.
Obama	0	There's no doubt that in many areas, like the agricultural sector, these immigrants are doing work that Americans would not do, at least at the wages that are paid.
Obama	0	There are other circumstances in which it is clear that employers are importing these workers simply because they don't want to pay the living wages that Americans demand.
Obama	0	There is no doubt that if construction companies were willing to pay more that they would see more U.S. workers applying for those jobs.
Obama	0	It does appear that undocumented workers have a somewhat adverse effect in depressing the wages of low-skill workers, which is why in the African-American community, for example, there is some nervousness of about the number of undocumented workers that are coming into this country and whether they are systematically replacing or pushing out low-skill, low-wage black workers.
Obama	0	Having said all that, I think we need to recognize that if we are going to uphold the traditions of this country as a nation of immigrants, than we are going to have to deal with this issue in a way that reflects common sense and compassion.
Obama	0	The House of Representatives passed a bill that was extraordinarily punitive.
Obama	0	It talked about border security and it made any undocumented worker in this country a felon; it also made people who potentially helped undocumented workers, for example, providing housing assistance or providing a domestic violence shelter potentially subject to a felony conviction.
Obama	0	It's that draconian measure that passed in the House that prompted these marches, but what started as a march of fear on the part of many undocumented workers, I think, has become a march for hope.
Obama	0	People are hoping that they have an opportunity to legalize themselves in some fashion.
Obama	0	In the United States Senate there has been a bipartisan group, including myself, Ted Kennedy, John McCain, Chuck Hagel, Mel Martinez, Ken Salazar, Lindsey Graham and a number of others who've been trying to negotiate a comprehensive package that would include stronger border security, making sure that employers actually verify employment status through a tamper-proof employee-verification card, and creation of a pathway to citizenship - earned citizenship - for the 11 to 12 million people that are already here.
Obama	0	The idea would be that those people, over the course of eleven years could earn their way to citizenship by paying a fine, paying their back taxes (if they owe any), staying out of trouble, learning English and so on.
Obama	0	The opponents of this kind of proposal call this amnesty and they hearken back to what happened in 1986 when, in fact, undocumented workers were provided amnesty.
Obama	0	There was supposed to be a grand bargain where in exchange for such amnesty there was going to be serious border security and employer sanctions on those who had hired undocumented workers.
Obama	0	That never really happened.
Obama	0	And so people who are opposed to the Senate bill believe that the best strategy is not to provide amnesty to these undocumented workers but simply shut off the possibility that they can be hired, perhaps deport them where they can be rounded up and build either a virtual wall or a literal wall along the Mexican and United States borders.
Obama	0	That kind of approach just isn't realistic.
Obama	0	We're not going to deport 11 to 12 million people; many of them have been here for many years, many of them have strong roots, many of them have children who were born here and are therefore United States citizens.
Obama	0	It's hard to imagine that we want to live in a country where we would have police and immigration officials coming into people's homes and taking away the father of a family, sending him back to Mexico, leaving a mother and child behind.
Obama	0	This is going to be an emotional issue.
Obama	0	It's not going to go away any time soon.
Obama	0	I think what we saw in those marches is the face of a new America.
Obama	0	America is changing and we can't be threatened by it.
Obama	0	We have to understand that we are going to be better off united than divided.
Obama	0	When I spoke to folks at this rally I insisted that for those undocumented workers who hope some way to have a pathway to citizenship, they have to understand that citizenship involves a common language, a common faith in the country, common commitments and a common sense of purpose, fealty to a common flag.
Obama	0	I think there are times in these marches were you have seen Mexican flags; there has been controversy around a Spanish national anthem.
Obama	0	I think that is not helpful because it indicates that somehow the traditional pattern of immigrants assimilating to a broader American culture is not what these marchers are seeking.
Obama	0	I think they have to seek that because that is the essence of this country - that in diversity we come together as one.
Obama	0	On the other hand, to those who are fearful of these immigrants, in some cases because they have come to represent a loss of control for the country and its borders, I would just say to them that we can't have a country in which you have a servant class that is picking our lettuce or plucking our chickens or looking after our children or mowing our lawns but who never have the full rights and obligations of citizenship.
Obama	0	That's just not the kind of country that I want to have my children grow up in and my hope is that over the coming months we can come up with the kind of comprehensive, thoughtful legislation that I think the Senate bill reflects and we can have strong border security, we can have employers do the right thing by hiring those who are here legally in some fashion, but that we also provide all those families, children, elderly people and teenagers that I saw in that amazing march on Monday the opportunity to be full members of the American community.
Obama	0	Anyway, I will keep you guys posted on this important issue and I look forward to talking to you next week.
Obama	0	Bye-bye.
Obama	0	Amendment to Stop No-Bid Contracts for Gulf Coast Recovery and Reconstruction  TOPIC: Katrina & Gulf Coast Recovery May 2, 2006 His Amendment to Stop No-Bid Contracts for Gulf Coast Recovery and Reconstruction Complete Text Mr. President, after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, millions of Americans opened their hearts, their homes, and their wallets to help the victims in the Gulf Coast.
Obama	0	Even before Katrina’s winds and rains died down, Americans across the country called national hotlines and pledged their hard-earned dollars, their time, and their prayers to the relief effort.
Obama	0	But they didn’t just pledge ?
Obama	0	they also delivered.
Obama	0	They delivered to the tune of $3.5 billion dollars.
Obama	0	Many of these donations came from working-class families who didn’t have much to give, but they gave what they could.
Obama	0	Like the American people, President Bush made a pledge after the disaster.
Obama	0	He pledged that he would provide the Gulf Coast with the federal assistance it needed to get back on its feet.
Obama	0	With the bill now before us, the total amount of federal funding for hurricane recovery will exceed $100 billion, and it’s safe to say that more money will be needed in the months and years to come.
Obama	0	But in order to make good on the President’s pledge, we need to do more.
Obama	0	We need to pledge to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.
Obama	0	We owe this to the Americans who donated their own funds to hurricane relief efforts and who trust us each day with the tax money they send to Washington.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, we haven’t done a very good job so far of delivering on this pledge.
Obama	0	Yesterday, Senator Coburn and I came to the floor to detail the numerous instances of waste, fraud, and abuse in the use of Katrina funds.
Obama	0	We know that FEMA spent nearly $880 million in taxpayer money on 25,000 temporary housing trailers stored around the country, including 11,000 that are rusting away in a field in Arkansas.
Obama	0	There are reports of prime contractors charging upwards of $30 per cubic yard for debris removal ?
Obama	0	work that actually costs subcontractors as little as $6 per cubic yard.
Obama	0	And, as the Washington Post reported, four large companies are charging a 1,500% mark-up to cover damaged roofs with plastic tarps.
Obama	0	Senator Coburn and I have tried to address these problems by offering a sensible package of amendments to ensure fiscal accountability and transparency.
Obama	0	We have proposed the appointment of a chief financial officer to oversee the spending of federal funding.
Obama	0	We have proposed limits on the amount of overhead expenses that a contractor can charge the federal government.
Obama	0	And we have proposed that the details of all large Katrina contracts be posted on the Internet.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, these amendments are not germane now that cloture has been invoked.
Obama	0	That is unfortunate.
Obama	0	It’s unfortunate because the interests of the American taxpayer are not being well-served by the U.S. Senate.
Obama	0	Even though we will have appropriated well over $100 billion by the end of this week for Katrina relief and recovery, we haven’t put any accountability systems in place to ensure that the money is well-spent.
Obama	0	I know I’m new to this body, but I’m troubled that Senate rules are getting in the way of sound policy.
Obama	0	I understand that’s how the Senate works, so Senator Coburn and I are here to offer one modest amendment to protect taxpayer dollars.
Obama	0	Our amendment addresses no-bid contracting and is germane to the underlying bill.
Obama	0	Immediately after the hurricane, FEMA awarded four $100 million no-bid contracts to four large companies.
Obama	0	$400 million taxpayer dollars, without full and open competition.
Obama	0	Acting FEMA Director David Paulison was asked about these contracts when he testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on October 6, 2005.
Obama	0	He said the following:  "I've been a public servant for a long time, and I've never been a fan of no-bid contracts.
Obama	0	Sometimes you have to do them because of the expediency of getting things done.
Obama	0	And I can assure that you we are going to look at all of those contracts very carefully.
Obama	0	All of those no-bid contracts, we are going to go back and rebid."
Obama	0	Senator Coburn and I expected Director Paulison to stick to his word and rebid these contracts.
Obama	0	But a month and a half passed, and the contracts still had not been rebid.
Obama	0	So last November, we introduced an amendment to the tax reconciliation bill expressing the Sense of the Senate that FEMA should immediately rebid these contracts.
Obama	0	Our colleagues agreed and passed this amendment by unanimous consent.
Obama	0	After our amendment passed, both Senator Coburn and I met with Director Paulison, and again he assured us that these contracts would be rebid.
Obama	0	Yet, these contracts still have not been rebid.
Obama	0	And to add insult to injury, FEMA said in March that the contracts would not be rebid after all.
Obama	0	In fact, the contracts actually have been extended, despite the fact that GAO found that three of these four firms had wasted millions of dollars in taxpayer funds.
Obama	0	The abuse doesn’t stop with these four contracts.
Obama	0	We learned just two weeks ago that the Army Corps of Engineers missed an opportunity to negotiate a lower price on a $40 million contract for portable classrooms in Mississippi.
Obama	0	Instead, a no-bid and overpriced contract was awarded to an out-of-state firm.
Obama	0	I’ve often heard it said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results.
Obama	0	Frankly, what we’re doing with Katrina funding borders on insanity ?
Obama	0	we in Congress just keep trusting FEMA to enter into competitive contracts even though there’s no evidence that it has any intention of doing so.
Obama	0	So the amendment we’re offering today is our effort to say enough is enough.
Obama	0	Our amendment requires all federal agencies to follow competitive bidding procedures for any Katrina-related contracts exceeding $500,000.
Obama	0	This is a common sense amendment.
Obama	0	Eight months after Katrina, there’s no longer any emergency that justifies a no-bid contract that might have been entered into the days after Katrina.
Obama	0	The American people deserve the benefits of competition on government contracts.
Obama	0	Competition is good for American business and it’s good for the government.
Obama	0	It helps to ensure high quality and low costs.
Obama	0	That’s what the American people have a right to expect, and that’s what our amendment seeks to deliver.
Obama	0	Before we spend another dollar in the Gulf Coast, let’s make sure that we have some transparency and accountability systems in place to ensure that federal money is helping those people most in need, instead of lining the pockets of a contractor.
Obama	0	In our rush to get money to the Gulf Coast eight months ago, we didn’t do that, and the American taxpayers ?
Obama	0	and more importantly, the victims of Katrina ?
Obama	0	paid a heavy price.
Obama	0	Let’s not repeat that mistake again.
Obama	0	I urge my colleagues to support Senator Coburn and me in this effort.
Obama	0	Updates on Darfur, Immigration and Gas Prices - Podcast Transcript  TOPICS: Foreign Policy & Defense, Immigration and Oil & Alternative Fuels April 27, 2006 Updates on Darfur, Immigration, Gas Prices Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama and today is Thursday, April 27, 2006.
Obama	0	A lot of stuff is going on in Washington right now and so what I want to do is provide you some updates on issues that have been discussed on this podcast before but I think are absolutely critical to focus on right now.
Obama	0	The first is the issue of Darfur.
Obama	0	Many of you heard my previous podcast and have been following this issue in the news.
Obama	0	We have a situation in which the Sudanese government in Khartoum has backed militias and gangsters that have slaughtered up to 300,000 innocent Africans.
Obama	0	We have a situation in which two million or so people are internally displaced in the Sudan, incredibly vulnerable to potential famine, disease and we're now seeing a spillover effect from Sudan into Chad, where you have another 200,000 refugees.
Obama	0	The Bush administration properly labeled this several years ago as an ongoing genocide.
Obama	0	The situation has not improved.
Obama	0	The world needs to focus its attention on it and America needs to send a message to its leadership that this is a top priority.
Obama	0	We need to get a UN protection force in there to protect the two million people who are internally displaced.
Obama	0	We've got to start peace talks between the rebels and the Khartoum government that provides some basis for a long-term settlement of disputes there and we have to make sure that humanitarian aid continues.
Obama	0	In the interest of all these issues stopping the genocide in Darfur there are going to be a couple of activities that I hope some of you can attend.
Obama	0	Number one: this Sunday, we are going to be holding a rally to save Darfur in the United States Capitol, in Washington.
Obama	0	That will be taking place from two o'clock until four o'clock in front of the United States Capitol, between 3rd Streets and 4th Streets.
Obama	0	If you are interested in participating, you should get on the website savedarfur.org.
Obama	0	That will give you all the details.
Obama	0	I'm going to be there and Elie Wiesel, the author and Holocaust survivor, is going to be there.
Obama	0	We're going to have George Clooney there as well as a number of people who have been active on this issue.
Obama	0	I hope we can have a strong turnout that sends a message that genocide is not acceptable not only in the United States but the United Nations and the international community have to rally behind these folks.
Obama	0	There is also going to be a Chicago rally on May 1, 2006 at 4:30 p.m. in the Federal Plaza in Dearborn and Adams and so for my Chicago listeners or Illinois listeners you can show your support in that fashion if you can't make the rally in Washington.
Obama	0	The second issue I just want to give you an update on is immigration.
Obama	0	I met with the President and some of my other colleagues in the West Wing this week to discuss with him where we are on immigration reform.
Obama	0	Obviously this is an issue of great passion.
Obama	0	It is an issue that has brought together diverse coalitions of people who recognize that we have to change how we approach immigration.
Obama	0	I've been one of they key negotiators in the Senate for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes something that everybody agrees to: we have to improve border security.
Obama	0	It also includes internal enforcement, making sure that employers actually are checking a verifiable, tamper-proof ID card to show that a worker is legally inside the United States to work.
Obama	0	But three, that we're providing a pathway to citizenship for the 11 to 12 million people who are already in the United States.
Obama	0	There's been a lot of talk on cable and talk radio about amnesty and how we shouldn't allow lawbreakers to become U.S. citizens.
Obama	0	The fact of the matter is that these 11 to 12 million people came here for the same reason that every immigrant group has come here and that's a search for a better life for their children.
Obama	0	They didn't do it through the regular processes and they should be penalized for that and as a consequence what we've been setting up is an eleven-year process that gives people an opportunity for citizenship but still puts them in the back of the line behind those who are applying legally for citizenship.
Obama	0	Having said that, it is important for us to bring these folks out of the shadows to ensure that they are subject to the same protections that any legal worker has in this country because if we leave them in the shadows, not only are they vulnerable, not only are they living in fear, many of these people are our neighbors, our friends, people who are looking after our children, doing work across the country, some of the dirtiest and toughest work without complaint.
Obama	0	But if we don't do anything, these are also folks who can, because of their tenuous status, undercut the wages of U.S. workers.
Obama	0	If they're not subject to minimum wage laws, if they're not subject to worker safety laws, if they can't unionize, than naturally their wages are going to be depressed and that means that there is an incentive for employers to hire these workers instead of U.S. citizens.
Obama	0	If, on the other hand, they're out of the shadows, they have the same rights and obligations as every other worker who is in this country legally, than they are on even footing in terms of employers making hiring decisions.
Obama	0	So don't get caught up in the false rhetoric about amnesty.
Obama	0	What we are talking about is an earned pathway to citizenship.
Obama	0	Over the course of eleven years, they would have to pay a fine, they would have to learn English, they would have to pay back taxes and they would be behind those who applied here legally.
Obama	0	So, they wouldn't' be rewarded for their illegal behavior but we would recognize that our future as a country involves absorbing these people who are already here so we wouldn't have an entire class of second-class citizens.
Obama	0	The third point I want to make is that I know gas prices are high out there.
Obama	0	There's been a lot of talk by the both the White House and Congress about how we're going to bring gas prices down.
Obama	0	I want to tell people the truth and that is that there aren't a lot of short-term solutions to this problem.
Obama	0	We have some bills in the Senate that are calling for the taxing of the windfall profits of the big oil companies who are making out like bandits.
Obama	0	I will vote "aye" on a bill like that if it comes through the Senate.
Obama	0	I've been active along with other Democrats in pushing to make sure that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating any kind of price-gauging that's taking place in gas stations around the country.
Obama	0	But the bottom line is that the United States, which has about 3 percent of the oil reserves in the world consumes 25 percent of the oil, and we're not going to be able to pump our way out of this problem and even if Exxon and Mobile decided they weren't going to make any profits, we'd still have problems because the world's oil market has reached $75 a barrel this week.
Obama	0	So we are going to have to think about how we are going to wean ourselves off our dependence on oil.
Obama	0	That's a national security imperative because right now we are financing both sides of the war on terrorism by sending billions of dollars to some of the most hostile countries on Earth.
Obama	0	It is an economic problem; it makes us extraordinarily vulnerable every time we see price shocks like this and that pressure is just going to continue as China and India grow and scramble for resources.
Obama	0	Finally, it's a major contributor to global warming.
Obama	0	It's helping us along the path that could lead to an environmental catastrophe that could have an adverse impact for our children and our grandchildren.
Obama	0	I've put together a series of speeches and proposals that are on my website.
Obama	0	I would urge everybody to take a look at them; I won't reiterate them now, but a lot of it focuses on increasing fuel efficiency standards and shifting to bio-diesel.
Obama	0	I just want everybody to remember as they are putting that $3 a gallon gas in their SUVs that our long-term answer is getting serious about a new energy policy.
Obama	0	We have to start making those plans now in a serious way and not just resort to cheap rhetoric whenever the gas prices go up.
Obama	0	I hope that I see some of you at the rallies, either in Washington or in Chicago, about Darfur.
Obama	0	I appreciate you listening.
Obama	0	Bye-bye.
Obama	0	Floor Statement on Immigration Reform  TOPIC: Immigration April 3, 2006 Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama Immigration Reform Complete Text Mr. President, I come to the floor today to enter the debate on comprehensive immigration reform.
Obama	0	It is a debate that will touch on the basic questions of morality, the law, and what it means to be an American.
Obama	0	I know that this debate evokes strong passions on all sides.
Obama	0	The recent peaceful but passionate protests that we saw all across the country--500,000 in Los Angeles and 100,000 in my hometown of Chicago--are a testament to this fact, as are the concerns of millions of Americans about the security of our borders.
Obama	0	But I believe we can work together to pass immigration reform in a way that unites the people in this country, not in a way that divides us by playing on our worst instincts and fears.
Obama	0	Like millions of Americans, the immigrant story is also my story.
Obama	0	My father came here from Kenya, and I represent a State where vibrant immigrant communities ranging from Mexican to Polish to Irish enrich our cities and neighborhoods.
Obama	0	So I understand the allure of freedom and opportunity that fuels the dream of a life in the United States.
Obama	0	But I also understand the need to fix a broken system.
Obama	0	When Congress last addressed this issue comprehensively in 1986, there were approximately 4 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.
Obama	0	That number had grown substantially when Congress again addressed the issue in 1996.
Obama	0	Today, it is estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented aliens living in our country.
Obama	0	The American people are a welcoming and generous people.
Obama	0	But those who enter our country illegally, and those who employ them, disrespect the rule of law.
Obama	0	And because we live in an age where terrorists are challenging our borders, we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, and unchecked.
Obama	0	Americans are right to demand better border security and better enforcement of the immigration laws.
Obama	0	The bill the Judiciary Committee has passed would clearly strengthen enforcement.
Obama	0	I will repeat that, because those arguing against the Judiciary Committee bill contrast that bill with a strong enforcement bill.
Obama	0	The bill the Judiciary Committee passed clearly strengthens enforcement.
Obama	0	To begin with, the agencies charged with border security would receive new technology, new facilities, and more people to stop, process, and deport illegal immigrants.
Obama	0	But while security might start at our borders, it doesn't end there.
Obama	0	Millions of undocumented immigrants live and work here without our knowing their identity or their background.
Obama	0	We need to strike a workable bargain with them.
Obama	0	They have to acknowledge that breaking our immigration laws was wrong.
Obama	0	They must pay a penalty, and abide by all of our laws going forward.
Obama	0	They must earn the right to stay over a 6-year period, and then they must wait another 5 years as legal permanent residents before they become citizens.
Obama	0	But in exchange for accepting those penalties, we must allow undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows and step on a path toward full participation in our society.
Obama	0	In fact, I will not support any bill that does not provide this earned path to citizenship for the undocumented population--not just for humanitarian reasons; not just because these people, having broken the law, did so for the best of motives, to try and provide a better life for their children and their grandchildren; but also because this is the only practical way we can get a handle on the population that is within our borders right now.
Obama	0	To keep from having to go through this difficult process again in the future, we must also replace the flow of undocumented immigrants coming to work here with a new flow of guestworkers.
Obama	0	Illegal immigration is bad for illegal immigrants and bad for the workers against whom they compete.
Obama	0	Replacing the flood of illegals with a regulated stream of legal immigrants who enter the United States after background checks and who are provided labor rights would enhance our security, raise wages, and improve working conditions for all Americans.
Obama	0	But I fully appreciate that we cannot create a new guestworker program without making it as close to impossible as we can for illegal workers to find employment.
Obama	0	We do not need new guestworkers plus future undocumented immigrants.
Obama	0	We need guestworkers instead of undocumented immigrants.
Obama	0	Toward that end, American employers need to take responsibility.
Obama	0	Too often illegal immigrants are lured here with a promise of a job, only to receive unconscionably low wages.
Obama	0	In the interest of cheap labor, unscrupulous employers look the other way when employees provide fraudulent U.S. citizenship documents.
Obama	0	Some actually call and place orders for undocumented workers because they don't want to pay minimum wages to American workers in surrounding communities.
Obama	0	These acts hurt both American workers and immigrants whose sole aim is to work hard and get ahead.
Obama	0	That is why we need a simple, foolproof, and mandatory mechanism for all employers to check the legal status of new hires.
Obama	0	Such a mechanism is in the Judiciary Committee bill.
Obama	0	And before any guestworker is hired, the job must be made available to Americans at a decent wage with benefits.
Obama	0	Employers then need to show that there are no Americans to take these jobs.
Obama	0	I am not willing to take it on faith that there are jobs that Americans will not take.
Obama	0	There has to be a showing.
Obama	0	If this guestworker program is to succeed, it must be properly calibrated to make certain that these are jobs that cannot be filled by Americans, or that the guestworkers provide particular skills we can't find in this country.
Obama	0	I know that dealing with the undocumented population is difficult, for practical and political reasons.
Obama	0	But we simply cannot claim to have dealt with the problems of illegal immigration if we ignore the illegal resident population or pretend they will leave voluntarily.
Obama	0	Some of the proposed ideas in Congress provide a temporary legal status and call for deportation, but fail to answer how the government would deport 11 million people.
Obama	0	I don't know how it would be done.
Obama	0	I don't know how we would line up all the buses and trains and airplanes and send 11 million people back to their countries of origin.
Obama	0	I don't know why it is that we expect they would voluntarily leave after having taken the risk of coming to this country without proper documentation.
Obama	0	I don't know many police officers across the country who would go along with the bill that came out of the House, a bill that would, if enacted, charge undocumented immigrants with felonies, and arrest priests who are providing meals to hungry immigrants, or people who are running shelters for women who have been subject to domestic abuse.
Obama	0	I cannot imagine that we would be serious about making illegal immigrants into felons, and going after those who would aid such persons.
Obama	0	That approach is not serious.
Obama	0	That is symbolism, that is demagoguery.
Obama	0	It is important that if we are going to deal with this problem, we deal with it in a practical, commonsense way.
Obama	0	If temporary legal status is granted but the policy says these immigrants are never good enough to become Americans, then the policy that makes little sense.
Obama	0	I believe successful, comprehensive immigration reform can be achieved by building on the work of the Judiciary Committee.
Obama	0	The Judiciary Committee bill combines some of the strongest elements of Senator Hagel's border security proposals with the realistic workplace and earned-citizenship program proposed by Senators McCain and Kennedy.
Obama	0	Mr. President, I will come to the floor over the next week to offer some amendments of my own, and to support amendments my colleagues will offer.
Obama	0	I will also come to the floor to argue against amendments that contradict our tradition as a nation of immigrants and as a nation of laws.
Obama	0	As FDR reminded the Nation at the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the Statue of Liberty, those who landed at Ellis Island ``were the men and women who had the supreme courage to strike out for themselves, to abandon language and relatives, to start at the bottom without influence, without money, and without knowledge of life in a very young civilization.''
Obama	0	It behooves us to remember that not every single immigrant who came into the United States through Ellis Island had proper documentation.
Obama	0	Not every one of our grandparents or great-grandparents would have necessarily qualified for legal immigration.
Obama	0	But they came here in search of a dream, in search of hope.
Obama	0	Americans understand that, and they are willing to give an opportunity to those who are already here, as long as we get serious about making sure that our borders actually mean something.
Obama	0	Today's immigrants seek to follow in the same tradition of immigration that has built this country.
Obama	0	We do ourselves and them a disservice if we do not recognize the contributions of these individuals.
Obama	0	And we fail to protect our Nation if we do not regain control over our immigration system immediately.
Obama	0	Energy Independence and the Safety of Our Planet  TOPIC: Oil & Alternative Fuels April 3, 2006 Energy Independence and the Safety of Our Planet Complete Text In April of 2005, Elizabeth Kolbert did a series of articles for The New Yorker about climate change.
Obama	0	In one of those articles, she tells a very interesting story about some of the effects we're already seeing from global warming.
Obama	0	About fifteen years ago, in the furthest reaches of Alaska, the people of a small, thousand-year-old, oceanfront hunting village noticed something odd.
Obama	0	The ice that surrounded and protected the village, which is only twenty feet above sea level, began to grow slushy and weak.
Obama	0	Soon, it began to freeze much later in the fall and melt much earlier in the spring.
Obama	0	As the ice continued to melt away at an alarming pace during the 1990s, the village began to lose the protection it offered and became more vulnerable to storm surges.
Obama	0	In 1997, the town completely lost a hundred-twenty-five-foot-wide strip of land at its northern edge.
Obama	0	In 2001, a storm with twelve-foot waves destroyed dozens of homes.
Obama	0	And finally, in the summer of 2002, with the storms intensifying, the ice melting, and the land shrinking all around them, the residents of Shishmaref were forced to move their entire town miles inland - abandoning their homes forever.
Obama	0	The story of the Village That Disappeared is by no means isolated.
Obama	0	And it is by no means over.
Obama	0	All across the world, in every kind of environment and region known to man, increasingly dangerous weather patterns and devastating storms are abruptly putting an end to the long-running debate over whether or not climate change is real.
Obama	0	Not only is it real, it's here, and its effects are giving rise to a frighteningly new global phenomenon: the man-made natural disaster.
Obama	0	For decades, we've been warned by legions of scientists and mountains of evidence that this was coming - that we couldn't just keep burning fossil fuels and contribute to the changing atmosphere without consequence.
Obama	0	And yet, for decades, far too many have ignored the warnings, either dismissing the science as a hoax or believing that it was the concern of enviros looking to save polar bears and rainforests.
Obama	0	But today, we're seeing that climate change is about more than a few unseasonably mild winters or hot summers.
Obama	0	It's about the chain of natural catastrophes and devastating weather patterns that global warming is beginning to set off around the world - the frequency and intensity of which are breaking records thousands of years old.
Obama	0	In Washington, issues come and go with the political winds.
Obama	0	And they are generally covered through that prism: Who's up and who's down?
Obama	0	Which party benefits?
Obama	0	Which party loses?
Obama	0	But in these superficial exchanges, we often lose sight of the real and lasting meaning of the decisions we make and those we defer.
Obama	0	The issue of climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril.
Obama	0	There may still be disputes about exactly how much we're contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere and how much is naturally occurring, but what we can be scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us to a point of no return.
Obama	0	And unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe.
Obama	0	Just think about some of the trends we've seen.
Obama	0	Since 1980, we've experienced nineteen of the twenty hottest years on record - with 2005 being the hottest ever.
Obama	0	These high temperatures are drying up already dry land, causing unprecedented drought that's ruining crops, devastating farmers and spreading famine to already poor parts of the world.
Obama	0	Over the last four decades, the percentage of the Earth's surface suffering drought has more than doubled.
Obama	0	In the United States, the drought we experienced in 2002 was the worst in forty years.
Obama	0	And in Africa, more rivers are beginning to dry up, threatening the water supply across the continent.
Obama	0	As more land becomes parched, more forests are starting to burn.
Obama	0	Across Indonesia, throughout Alaska, and in the Western United States, wildfires have raged in recent years like never before.
Obama	0	A new record was set in 2002, as more than 7 million acres burned from Oregon down to Arizona.
Obama	0	And while the situation on the land may look ugly, what's going on in the oceans is even worse.
Obama	0	Hurricanes and typhoons thrive in warm water, and as the temperature has risen, so has the intensity of these storms.
Obama	0	In the last thirty-five years, the percentage of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has doubled, and the wind speed and duration of these storms has jumped 50%.
Obama	0	A hurricane showed up in the South Atlantic recently when scientists said it could never happen.
Obama	0	Last year, Japan set a new record when it suffered its tenth typhoon and the United States set a record for the most tornadoes we've ever had.
Obama	0	And at one point, Hurricane Wilma was the most powerful storm ever measured.
Obama	0	These are all frightening situations, but perhaps none more so than what is beginning to occur at the North and South Poles.
Obama	0	There, a satellite image from space or a trip to the region shows indisputable evidence that the polar ice caps are melting.
Obama	0	But it's not just a slow, steady thaw that's been occurring over centuries, it's a rapidly accelerating meltdown that may eventually dump enough water into the ocean to annihilate coastal regions across the globe.
Obama	0	In 1996, a melting Greenland dumped about 22 cubic miles of water into the sea.
Obama	0	Today, just ten years later, it's melting twice as fast.
Obama	0	In real terms, this means that every single month, Greenland is dumping into the ocean an amount of water 54 times greater than the city of Los Angeles uses in an entire year.
Obama	0	All in all, Greenland has enough ice to raise the global sea level 23 feet, making a New Orleans out of nearly every coastal city imaginable.
Obama	0	Indeed, the Alaskan village of Shishmaref could be just the beginning.
Obama	0	And yet, despite all the ominous harbingers of things to come, we do not have to stand by helplessly and accept this future.
Obama	0	In fact, we can't afford to.
Obama	0	Climate change may be unleashing the forces of nature, but we can't forget that this has been accelerated by man and can be slowed by man too.
Obama	0	By now, the culprit of this climate change is a familiar one, as is the solution.
Obama	0	Last September, when I gave my first speech on energy, I talked about how our dependence on oil is hurting our economy, decimating our auto industry, and costing us millions of jobs.
Obama	0	A few months ago, I discussed how the oil we import is jeopardizing our national security by keeping us tied to the world's most dangerous and unstable regimes.
Obama	0	And when it comes to climate change, it's the fossil fuels we insist on burning - particularly oil - that are the single greatest cause of global warming and the damaging weather patterns that have been its result.
Obama	0	You'd think by now we'd get the point on energy dependence.
Obama	0	Never has the failure to take on a single challenge so detrimentally affected nearly every aspect of our well-being as a nation.
Obama	0	And never have the possible solutions had the potential to do so much good for so many generations to come.
Obama	0	Of course, many Americans have gotten this point, and it's true that the call for energy independence is now coming from an amazingly diverse coalition of interests.
Obama	0	From farmers and businesses, military leaders and CIA officials, scientists and Evangelical Christians, auto executives and unions, and politicians of almost every political persuasion, people are realizing that an oil future is not a secure future for this country.
Obama	0	And yet, when it comes to finding a way to end our dependence on fossil fuels, the greatest vacuum in leadership, the biggest failure of imagination, and the most stubborn refusal to admit the need for change is coming from the very people who are running the country.
Obama	0	By now, the Bush Administration's record on climate change is almost legendary.
Obama	0	This is the administration that commissioned government experts and scientists to do a study on global warming, only to omit the part from the final report that said it was caused by humans.
Obama	0	This is the administration that didn't try to improve the Kyoto Treaty by trying to include oil guzzlers like China and India, but walked away from the entire global effort to stem climate change.
Obama	0	And just recently, this is the administration that tried to silence a NASA scientist for letting the rest of us know that yes, climate change is a pretty big deal.
Obama	0	Meanwhile, it's pretty tough to make any real progress on this issue in Congress when the Chairman of the committee in charge of the environment thinks that, in the face of literally thousands of scientists and studies that say otherwise, global warming is the "greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people."
Obama	0	And you know it's bad when the star witness at his global warming hearing is a science fiction writer.
Obama	0	Now, after the President's last State of the Union, when he told us that America was addicted to oil, there was a brief moment of hope that he'd finally do something on energy.
Obama	0	I was among the hopeful.
Obama	0	But then I saw the plan.
Obama	0	His funding for renewable fuels is at the same level it was the day he took office.
Obama	0	He refuses to call for even a modest increase in fuel-efficiency standards for cars.
Obama	0	And his latest budget funds less then half of the energy bill he himself signed into law - leaving hundreds of millions of dollars in under-funded energy proposals.
Obama	0	This is not a serious effort.
Obama	0	Saying that America is addicted to oil without following a real plan for energy independence is like admitting alcoholism and then skipping out on the 12-step program.
Obama	0	It's not enough to identify the challenge - we have to meet it.
Obama	0	See, there's a reason that some have compared the quest for energy independence to the Manhattan Project or the Apollo moon landing.
Obama	0	Like those historic efforts, moving away from an oil economy is a major challenge that will require a sustained national commitment.
Obama	0	During World War II, we had an entire country working around the clock to produce enough planes and tanks to beat the Axis powers.
Obama	0	In the middle of the Cold War, we built a national highway system so we had a quick way to transport military equipment across the country.
Obama	0	When we wanted to pull ahead of the Russians into space, we poured millions into a national education initiative that graduated thousands of new scientists and engineers.
Obama	0	America now finds itself at a similar crossroads.
Obama	0	As gas prices keep rising, the Middle East grows ever more unstable, and the ice caps continue to melt, we face a now-or-never, once-in-a-generation opportunity to set this country on a different course.
Obama	0	Such a course is not only possible, it's already being pursued in other places around the world.
Obama	0	Countries like Japan are creating jobs and slowing oil consumption by churning out and buying millions of fuel-efficient cars.
Obama	0	Brazil, a nation that once relied on foreign countries to import 80% of its crude oil, will now be entirely self-sufficient in a few years thanks to its investment in biofuels.
Obama	0	So why can't we do this?
Obama	0	Why can't we make energy security one of the great American projects of the 21st century?
Obama	0	The answer is, with the right leadership, we can.
Obama	0	We can do it by partnering with business, not fighting it.
Obama	0	We can do it with technology we already have on the shelf.
Obama	0	And we can do it by investing in the clean, cheap, renewable fuels that American farmers grow right here at home.
Obama	0	To deal directly with climate change, something we failed to do in the last energy bill, we should use a market-based strategy that gradually reduces harmful emissions in the most economical way.
Obama	0	John McCain and Joe Lieberman are continuing to build support for legislation based on this approach, and Senators Bingaman and Domenici are also pursuing proposals that will cut carbon emissions.
Obama	0	Right here in Chicago, the Chicago Climate Exchange is already running a legally binding greenhouse gas trading system.
Obama	0	The idea here is simple: if you're a business that can't yet meet the lower cap we'll put on harmful carbon emissions, you can either purchase credits from other companies that have achieved more than their emissions goal, or you can temporarily purchase a permit from the government, the money from which will go towards investments in clean energy technology.
Obama	0	As Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense has said, "Once you put a value on carbon reductions, you make winners out of innovators."
Obama	0	Any strategy for reducing carbon emissions must also deal with coal, which is actually the most abundant source of energy in this country.
Obama	0	To keep using this fossil fuel, I believe we need to invest in the kind of advanced coal technology that will keep our air cleaner while still keeping our coal mines in business.
Obama	0	Over the next two decades, power companies are expected to build dozens of new coal-fired power plants, and countries like India and China will build hundreds.
Obama	0	If they use obsolete technology, these plants will emit over 60 billion tons of heat-trapping pollution into the atmosphere.
Obama	0	We need to act now and make the United States a leader in puting in place the standards and incentives that will ensure that these plants use available technology to capture carbon dioxide and dispose of it safely underground.
Obama	0	But of course, one of the biggest contributors to our climate troubles and our energy dependence is oil, and so any plan for the future must drastically reduce our addiction to this dirty, dangerous, and ultimately finite source of energy.
Obama	0	We can do this by focusing on two things: the cars we drive and the fuels we use.
Obama	0	The President's energy proposal would reduce our oil imports by 4.5 million barrels per day by 2025.
Obama	0	Not only can we do better than that, we must do better than that if we hope to make a real dent in our oil dependency.
Obama	0	With technology we have on the shelves right now and fuels we can grow right here in America, by 2025 we can reduce our oil imports by over 7.5. million barrels per day - an amount greater than all the oil we are expected to import from the entire Middle East.
Obama	0	For years, we've hesitated to raise fuel economy standards as a nation in part because of a very legitimate concern - the impact it would have on Detroit.
Obama	0	The auto industry is right when they argue that transitioning to more hybrid and fuel-efficient cars would require massive investment at a time when they're struggling under the weight of rising health care costs, sagging profits, and stiff competition.
Obama	0	But it's precisely because of that competition that they don't have a choice.
Obama	0	China now has a higher fuel economy standard than we do, and Japan's Toyota is doubling production of the popular Prius to sell 100,000 in the U.S. this year.
Obama	0	There is now no doubt that fuel-efficient cars represent the future of the auto industry.
Obama	0	If American car companies hope to be a part of that future - if they hope to survive - they must start building more of these cars.
Obama	0	This isn't just about energy - this is about the ability to create millions of new jobs and save an entire American industry.
Obama	0	But that's not to say we should leave the industry to face the transition costs on its own.
Obama	0	Yes, we should raise fuel economy standards by 3% a year over the next fifteen years, starting in 2008.
Obama	0	With the technology they already have, this should be an achievable goal for automakers.
Obama	0	But we can help them get there.
Obama	0	Right now, one of the biggest costs facing auto manufacturers isn't the cars they make, it's the health care they provide.
Obama	0	Health care costs make up $1,500 of the price of every GM car that's made - more than the cost of steel.
Obama	0	Retiree health care alone cost the Big 3 automakers nearly $6.7 billion just last year.
Obama	0	I believe we should make the auto companies a deal that could solve this problem.
Obama	0	It's a piece of legislation I introduced called "Health Care for Hybrids," and it would allow the federal government to pick up part of the tab for the auto companies' retiree health care costs.
Obama	0	In exchange, the auto companies would then use some of that savings to build and invest in more fuel-efficient cars.
Obama	0	It's a win-win proposal for the industry - their retirees will be taken care of, they'll save money on health care, and they'll be free to invest in the kind of fuel-efficient cars that are the key to their competitive future.
Obama	0	But building cars that use less oil is only one side of the equation.
Obama	0	The other involves replacing the oil we use with the home-grown biofuels that will finally slow the warming of the planet.
Obama	0	In fact, one study shows that using cellulosic ethanol fuel instead of oil can reduce harmful emissions by up to 75%.
Obama	0	Already, there are hundreds of fueling stations that use a blend of ethanol and gasoline known as E85, and there are millions of cars on the road with the flexible-fuel tanks necessary to use this fuel - including my own right here in Illinois.
Obama	0	But the challenge we face with these biofuels is getting them out of the labs, out of the farms, and onto the wider commercial market.
Obama	0	The federal government can help in a few ways here, and recently, I introduced the American Fuels Act with Senator Dick Lugar to get us started.
Obama	0	First, this legislation would reduce the risk of investing in renewable fuels by providing loan guarantees and venture capital to those entrepreneurs with the best plans to develop and sell biofuels on a commercial market.
Obama	0	Second, it would let the private sector know that there will always be a market for renewable fuels by creating an alternative diesel standard in this country that would blend millions of more gallons of renewable fuels into the petroleum supply each year.
Obama	0	Third, it would help make sure that every single new car in America is a flexible-fuel vehicle within a decade.
Obama	0	Currently it costs manufacturers just $100 to add these tanks to each car.
Obama	0	But we can do them one better.
Obama	0	If they install flexible-fuel tanks in their cars before the decade's up, we will provide them a $100 tax credit to do it - so there's no excuse for delay.
Obama	0	And we'd also give consumers a bargain by offering a 35 cents tax credit for every gallon of E85 they use.
Obama	0	Fourth, this legislation calls for a Director of Energy Security to oversee all of our efforts.
Obama	0	Like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the National Intelligence Director, this person would be an advisor to the National Security Council and have the full authority to coordinate America's energy policy across all levels of government.
Obama	0	He or she would approve all major budget decisions and provide a full report to Congress and the country every year detailing the progress we're making toward energy independence.
Obama	0	Finally, while it's not in the bill, we should also make sure that every single automobile the government purchases is a flexible-fuel vehicle - starting today.
Obama	0	When it becomes possible in the coming years, we should also make sure that every government car is the type of hybrid that you can plug-in to an outlet and recharge.
Obama	0	As the last few residents of Shishmaref pack up their homes and leave their tiny seaside village behind, I can't help but think that right now, history is testing our generation.
Obama	0	Will we let this happen all over the world?
Obama	0	Will we stand by while drought and famine, storms and floods overtake our planet?
Obama	0	Or will we look back at today and say that this was the moment when we took a stand?
Obama	0	That this was the moment when we began to turn things around?
Obama	0	The climate changes we are experiencing are already causing us harm.
Obama	0	But in the end, it will not be us who deal with its most devastating effects.
Obama	0	It will be our children, and our grandchildren.
Obama	0	I have two daughters, aged three and seven.
Obama	0	And I can't help but think that they are the reason I wanted to make a difference in this country in the first place - to give them a better, more hopeful world to raise their children.
Obama	0	This is our generation's chance to give them that world.
Obama	0	It's a chance that will not last much longer, but if we work together and seize this moment, we can change the course of this nation forever.
Obama	0	I hope we can start today.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Improving Chemical Plant Security - Podcast Transcript  TOPIC: Homeland Security March 29, 2006 Improving Chemical Plant Security Senator Barack Obama Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama and today is Wednesday, March 29, 2006.
Obama	0	You know, there has obviously been a lot of talk about homeland security since the tragedy of 9/11.
Obama	0	We have recently seen the debate flair up around the issue or ports and the nation of Dubai bidding to take over some of our critical port infrastructure.
Obama	0	In this whole discussion, I think that many of you may not be aware of the degree to which we have utterly failed to deal with what may be one of the most significant potential terror threats to this country and that is how we protect our chemical plants across the nation.
Obama	0	The 9/11 Commission focused specifically on the dangers of our chemical plants, how exposed they are.
Obama	0	Industrial chemicals such as chlorine, ammonia, phosgene, methyl bromide, hydrochloric and various other acids are routinely stored near cities in multi-ton quantities.
Obama	0	These chemicals are extraordinarily hazardous.
Obama	0	Several are identical to those that were used as weapons during the First World War.
Obama	0	Today they are 111 facilities in the country where a catastrophic chemical release could threaten more than one million people.
Obama	0	These plants represent some of the most attractive targets for terrorists looking to cause wide spread death and destruction.
Obama	0	Despite this fact, security at our chemical plants is voluntary.
Obama	0	It's left to the individual plant owners.
Obama	0	While many chemical plant owners have taken steps to beef up security, there are a lot who haven't.
Obama	0	We are still hearing reports of chemical plants with lap-dated fences, under-sized guard forces, and unprotected tanks of hazardous chemicals.
Obama	0	Basically these plants are stationary weapons of mass destruction spread all across the country.
Obama	0	Their security is light, their facilities are easily entered, and their contents are deadly.
Obama	0	Now, five years after 9/11, the federal government has done virtually nothing to secure these chemical plants.
Obama	0	It's a travesty that the 9/11 Commission, in looking at what has been done over the last five years gave us basically an "F" when it came to chemical plant security.
Obama	0	So what I've done working with Senator Frank Lautenberg from New Jersey, is to introduce legislation that would protect our communities from this potential threat but in a balanced way.
Obama	0	There are features in this bill that I think have to be part of any chemical security legislation passed by this Congress, and Congress has to go ahead and actually act on legislation in this area.
Obama	0	So, here are a couple things that the bill does.
Obama	0	Number one: it establishes a general duty to improve security at facilities storing threshold amounts of chemicals.
Obama	0	What that means is that chemical facilities would have to take steps to improve security including improving barriers, containment, mitigation, safety training, and where possible, use safer technology.
Obama	0	That is known as Inherent Safer Technology, or "IST," what that means is essentially, plants should use less toxic chemicals, and employ safer procedures where possible.
Obama	0	Second thing it does is it identifies high priority chemical facilities.
Obama	0	It directs the Department of Homeland Security to work with the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as state and local agencies to identify those areas that need special attention either because they are close to population centers, the type or amount of chemicals that are involved, their threat to national security and critical infrastructure.
Obama	0	Third thing: it requires high priority facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and develop and implement response plans.
Obama	0	That's something that is not currently done.
Obama	0	Fourth thing it does is it says that if states decide to create laws that are more stringent than the national standard, they are not preempted; states can make decisions that they want even better protection for our chemical plants.
Obama	0	Next, it protects whistle-blowers.
Obama	0	It protects employees who report dangerous gaps in security to the Homeland Security Department.
Obama	0	Finally, it protects security information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and other state and local disclosure laws, so you don't have chemical plant security measures on the net for terrorists to tap into.
Obama	0	These are some common sense provisions; unfortunately, the chemical lobby is one of the most powerful ones in Washington.
Obama	0	It spends more money than just about any other lobby, including the pharmaceutical industry.
Obama	0	They have dragged their feet, in terms of wanting to move this issue forward.
Obama	0	I understand that there is no company out there that wants to be regulated, companies are generally allergic to any intrusion in their business decisions, but this is something of such great importance that we can't afford to rely solely on voluntary measures.
Obama	0	It's overdue; it's time that we acted.
Obama	0	My hope is that the Lautenberg-Obama Chemical Security and Safety Act moves in this Congress and I would urge all of you to contact your legislators to suggest that this is in fact something that you guys strongly support.
Obama	0	I appreciate your time, and I look forward to talking to you next week.
Obama	0	Bye bye.
Obama	0	21st Century Schools for a 21st Century Economy  TOPIC: Education March 13, 2006 21st Century Schools for a 21st Century Economy Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Chicago, IL Complete Text Awhile back, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation.
Obama	0	In it, he talks about his recent travels to schools across America, and how fifty years after Brown v. Board of Education, we have an education system in this country that is still visibly separate and painfully unequal.
Obama	0	At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he meets some children who explain with heart-wrenching honesty what living in this system is like.
Obama	0	One girl told him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
Obama	0	The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding.
Obama	0	Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story.
Obama	0	And she began to cry.
Obama	0	When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing.
Obama	0	I did not need sewing either.
Obama	0	I knew how to sew.
Obama	0	My mother is a seamstress in a factory.
Obama	0	I'm trying to go to college.
Obama	0	I don't need to sew to go to college.
Obama	0	My mother sews.
Obama	0	I hoped for something else."
Obama	0	I hoped for something else.
Obama	0	It's a simple dream, but it speaks to us so powerfully because it is our dream - one that exists at the very center of the American experience.
Obama	0	One that says if you're willing to work hard and take responsibility, then you'll have the chance to reach for something else; for something better.
Obama	0	The ideal of public education has always been at the heart of this bargain.
Obama	0	From the moment we built the first schools in the towns of New England, it was the driving force behind Thomas Jefferson's declaration that "...talent and virtue, needed in a free society, should be educated regardless of wealth, birth or other accidental condition."
Obama	0	It's a bargain our government kept as we moved from a nation of farms to a nation of factories, setting up a system of free public high schools across the country.
Obama	0	It's a bargain we expanded after World War II, when we sent over two million returning heroes to college on the GI Bill, creating the largest middle class in history.
Obama	0	And even when our government refused to hold up its end of this bargain and forced Linda Brown to walk miles to a dilapidated Topeka school because she wasn't allowed in the well-off, white-only school; even then, ordinary people stood up and spoke out until the day when the arrival of nine little children at a school in Little Rock made real the decision that in America, separate could never be equal.
Obama	0	Because in America, it's the promise of a good education for all that makes it possible for any child to transcend the barriers of race or class or background and achieve their God-given potential.
Obama	0	In this country, it is education that allows our children to hope for something else.
Obama	0	As the twenty-first century unfolds, we are called once again to make real this hope - to meet the new challenges of a global economy by carrying forth the ideals of progress and opportunity through public education in America.
Obama	0	We now live in a world where the most valuable skill you can sell is knowledge.
Obama	0	Revolutions in technology and communication have created an entire economy of high-tech, high-wage jobs that can be located anywhere there's an internet connection.
Obama	0	And today, a child in Chicago is not only competing for jobs with one in Boston, but thousands more in Bangalore and Beijing who are being educated longer and better than ever before.
Obama	0	America is in danger of losing this competition.
Obama	0	We now have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized country.
Obama	0	By 12th grade, our children score lower on their math and science tests than most other kids in the world.
Obama	0	And today, countries like China are graduating eight times as many engineers as we do.
Obama	0	And yet, as these fundamental changes are occurring all around us, we still hear about schools that are giving students the choice between hairstyling and braiding.
Obama	0	Today we are failing too many of our children.
Obama	0	We're sending them out into a 21st century economy by sending them through the doors of 20th century schools.
Obama	0	Right now, six million middle and high school students are reading at levels significantly below their grade level.
Obama	0	Half of all teenagers can't understand basic fractions; half of all nine year olds can't perform basic multiplication or division.
Obama	0	For some students, the data is even worse: almost 60% of African-American fourth-graders can't read at even the basic level, and by 8th grade, nearly nine in ten African-American and Latino students are not proficient in math.
Obama	0	More students than ever are taking college entrance exams, but these tests are showing that only twenty percent are prepared to take college-level classes in English, math, and science.
Obama	0	For African-American students, the figure dips to just ten percent.
Obama	0	What happens to these children?
Obama	0	What happens to the one in four eighth graders who never go on to finish high school in five years?
Obama	0	What happens to the one in two high school graduates who never go on to college?
Obama	0	Thirty or forty years ago, they may have gone on to find a factory job that could pay the bills and support a family.
Obama	0	But we no longer live in that world.
Obama	0	Today, the average salary of a high school graduate is only $33,000 a year.
Obama	0	For high school dropouts, it's even closer to the poverty line - just $25,000.
Obama	0	If we do nothing about this, if we accept this kind of economy; this kind of society, we face a future where the ideal of American meritocracy could turn into an American myth.
Obama	0	A future that's not only morally unacceptable for our children; but economically untenable for a nation that finds itself in a globalized world, as countries who are out-educating us today out-compete our workers tomorrow.
Obama	0	The President promised that he would change all this with No Child Left Behind Act.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, the Administration has failed on the implementation of that law.
Obama	0	Not only have they failed to provide billions in adequate funding, they've also failed to design better assessment tests that provide a clearer path for schools to raise achievement.
Obama	0	They've failed to work with states so that they could honor their own commitment to provide every child with a highly qualified teacher.
Obama	0	As a result, they've had to exempt numerous states from meeting certain provisions of No Child Left Behind, and now it appears unlikely that they will meet their own goal of getting our children to grade level by the year 2014.
Obama	0	This is unacceptable.
Obama	0	If we truly believe in our public schools, then we have a moral responsibility to do better - to break the either-or mentality around the debate over education that asks us to choose between more money or more reform, and embrace a both-and mentality.
Obama	0	Because we know that good schools will require both the structural reform and the resources necessary to prepare our kids for the future.
Obama	0	We can learn from innovation taking place all over the country and right here in Chicago.
Obama	0	Chicago Public Schools are collaborating on a number of innovations with foundations and groups like New Leaders for New Schools, Teach for America, the New Teacher Project, the Chicago Public Education Fund, The Academy for Urban School Leadership and the University of Chicago Urban Education Initiative.
Obama	0	The Chicago Teachers Union is also now collaborating on the Fresh Start Schools, and we're watching that experiment with great interest.
Obama	0	It's not easy, it's not popular with everyone, and, in the end, some of the experiments may be rejected.
Obama	0	But we can't stop trying.
Obama	0	We have to keep moving ahead for the sake of our children.
Obama	0	Now, the problem on a national level is that we are not applying what we're learning from these reforms to our national education policy.
Obama	0	And so we need new vision for education in America - one where we move past ideology to experiment with the latest reforms, measure the results, and make policy decisions based on what works and what doesn't.
Obama	0	Fortunately, educational leaders like the people in this room know what reforms really work: a more challenging and rigorous curriculum with emphasis on math, science, and literacy skills.
Obama	0	Longer hours and more days to give kids the time and attention they need to learn.
Obama	0	Early childhood education for every child so they're not left behind before they even start school, a measure Governor Blagojevich has recently introduced.
Obama	0	Meaningful, performance-based assessments that can give us a fuller picture of how a student is doing.
Obama	0	And putting effective teachers and transformative principals in front of our kids.
Obama	0	All of these reforms need to be scaled-up and replicated across the country.
Obama	0	But in the time I have remaining, let me use just talk about a few to point to what's possible, starting with one place where I think we can start making a big difference in education right now.
Obama	0	From the moment our children step into a classroom, new evidence shows that the single most important factor in determining their achievement today is not the color of their skin or where they come from; it's not who their parents are or how much money they have.
Obama	0	It's who their teacher is.
Obama	0	It's the person who will brave some of the most difficult schools, the most challenging children, and accept the most meager compensation simply to give someone else the chance to succeed.
Obama	0	One study shows that two groups of students who started third grade at about the same level of math achievement finished fifth grade at vastly different levels.
Obama	0	The group with the effective teacher saw their scores rise by nearly 25%.
Obama	0	The group with the ineffective teacher actually saw their scores drop by 25%.
Obama	0	But even though we know how much teaching matters, in too many places we've abandoned our teachers and principals, sending them into some of the most impoverished, underperforming schools with little experience or pay; little preparation or support.
Obama	0	After a few years of experience, most will leave to pick wealthier, less challenging schools.
Obama	0	The result is that some of our neediest children end up with less-experienced, poorly-paid teachers who are far more likely to be teaching subjects in which they have no training.
Obama	0	Minority students are twice as likely to have these teachers.
Obama	0	In Illinois, students in high-poverty schools are more than three times as likely to have them.
Obama	0	If we hope to give our children a chance, it's time we start giving our teachers and our principals a chance.
Obama	0	We can't change the whole country overnight.
Obama	0	But what we can do is give more school districts the chance to revolutionize the way they approach teaching.
Obama	0	By helping spark complete reform across an entire school district, we can learn what actually works for our kids and then replicate those policies throughout the country.
Obama	0	So here's the legislation I'm introducing this week - it's the creation of what I call Innovation Districts.
Obama	0	School districts from around the country that want to become seedbeds of reform would apply and we'd select the twenty with the best plans to put effective, supported teachers in all classrooms and increase achievement for all students.
Obama	0	We'd offer these districts substantial new resources to do this, but in return, we'd ask them to try systemic new reforms.
Obama	0	Above all, we'd require results.
Obama	0	In Innovation Districts, we'd begin by working with these districts to strengthen their teaching, and we'd start with recruitment.
Obama	0	Right now we don't have nearly enough effective teachers and principals in the places we need them most: urban and rural schools, and subject areas like math and science.
Obama	0	One of the main reasons for this, cited by most teachers who leave the profession, is that no one gives them the necessary training and preparation.
Obama	0	Around the country, organizations like the Academy for Urban School Leadership right here in Chicago are changing this by recruiting and training new, highly-qualified teachers for some of the hardest-to-teach classrooms in the country.
Obama	0	We need to expand this by giving districts help in creating new teacher academies that will partner with organizations like this to recruit effective teachers for low-performing, high-poverty schools.
Obama	0	Each teacher would undergo an extensive training program before they begin, including classroom observation and participation.
Obama	0	These teacher academies are also showing us that it's not enough to just put outstanding teachers in the classroom - we have to place outstanding principals in the schools as well.
Obama	0	In districts across the country, the role of principal is being transformed from bureaucratic manager to instructional leader who can set high standards and recruit great talent.
Obama	0	With 230 New Leaders serving more than 100,000 kids annually, New Leaders for New Schools has been at the cutting edge of this process - a process we need to expand nationally.
Obama	0	After we recruit great teachers, we need to pay them better.
Obama	0	Right now, teaching is one of the only professions where no matter how well you perform at your job, you're almost never rewarded for success.
Obama	0	But with six-figure salaries luring away some of our most talented college graduates from some of our neediest schools, this needs to change.
Obama	0	That's why teachers in these Innovation Districts who are successful in improving student achievement would receive substantial pay increases, as would those who choose to teach in the most troubled schools and the highest-need subject areas, like math and science.
Obama	0	The city of Denver is trying pay increases in partnership with the local union, and when Chattanooga, Tennessee offered similar incentives for teachers who taught in high-need schools, student reading scores went up by over 10%.
Obama	0	Of course, teachers don't just need more pay, they need more support.
Obama	0	One thing I kept hearing when I visited Dodge Elementary here in Chicago is how much an encouraging principal or the advice of an experienced teacher can make a difference.
Obama	0	That's why teachers would be paired with mentor teachers who've been there before.
Obama	0	After a few years of experience, they'd then have the chance to become mentor teachers themselves.
Obama	0	We also know that teachers can't teach and our kids can't learn when there's violence in and around our schools, a problem we've seen right here in Chicago this year in too many tragic incidents.
Obama	0	If our kids can't go to school in a safe place, nothing else we do matters.
Obama	0	As we move forward with reform, we must makes safety a top priority.
Obama	0	In the innovation districts, we'd help do this by expanding programs already being used in various states that teach students about positive behavior.
Obama	0	Finally, we would also require Innovation Districts to work with their unions to uncover bureaucratic obstacles that leave poor kids without good teachers, including hiring, funding and transfer policies.
Obama	0	Districts would work with unions to tackle these problems so that we can provide every child with an effective teacher.
Obama	0	Beyond policies that help teachers specifically, we'd also ask Innovation Districts to try reforms that create a more effective teaching environment.
Obama	0	To give teachers more time with their students and more time to learn from each other, these districts would be asked to restructure their schedules and implement either longer days or summer school.
Obama	0	In December, I also introduced the STEP Up Act that addresses this by providing summer learning opportunities for children at high risk early in their school careers.
Obama	0	In addition to more learning, this would provide kids a safe, educational environment while their parents are at work.
Obama	0	To hold schools and teachers accountable for the results of all these reforms, districts that don't improve would be removed from the program.
Obama	0	To find out what works and what doesn't, we'd provide them with powerful data and technology, and also give them the option of partnering with local universities to help them improve performance.
Obama	0	These reforms would take an important first step toward fixing our broken system by putting qualified, supported teachers in the schools that need them most.
Obama	0	But beyond that, they would show us the progress we can make when money is well spent.
Obama	0	And they would allow us to finally break free from the either-or mentality that's put bureaucracy and ideology ahead of what works; ahead of what's best for our kids.
Obama	0	When it comes to education, the time for excuses has passed - for all of us.
Obama	0	During my visit to Dodge Elementary, I was able to speak with a few of the teachers about some of the challenges they're facing in educating their students.
Obama	0	And one teacher mentioned to me that in one of the biggest obstacles in her view is what she referred to as the "These Kids" syndrome.
Obama	0	She said that when it comes to educating students today, people always seem to find a million excuses for why "these kids" can't learn.
Obama	0	That you'll hear how "these kids are nothing but trouble," or "these kids come from tough backgrounds," or "these kids don't want to learn."
Obama	0	And the more people talk about them as "these kids," the easier it is for "these kids" to become somebody else's problem.
Obama	0	But of course, the children in this country - the children in Dodge Elementary, and South Central L.A., and rural Arkansas, and suburban Maryland - they are not "these kids."
Obama	0	They are our kids.
Obama	0	They want a chance to achieve - and each of us has a responsibility to give them that chance.
Obama	0	In the end, children succeed because somewhere along the way, a parent or teacher instills in them the belief that they can.
Obama	0	That they're able to.
Obama	0	That they're worth it.
Obama	0	At Earhart Elementary in Chicago, one little girl, raised by a single mom from a poor background, was asked the secret to her academic success.
Obama	0	She said, "I just study hard every night because I like learning.
Obama	0	My teacher wants me to be a good student, and so does my mother.
Obama	0	I don't want to let them down."
Obama	0	In the months and years to come, it's time for this nation to rededicate itself to the ideal of a world class education for every American child.
Obama	0	It's time to let our kids hope for something else.
Obama	0	It's time to instill the belief in every child that they can succeed - and then make sure we make good on the promise to never let them down.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Obama's Floor Statement on Meals Amendment  TOPIC: Ethics & Lobbying Reform March 8, 2006 Senator Obama's Floor Statement on Meals Amendment Complete Text I rise today in support of Senator Feingold's amendment to eliminate a loophole in this bill that would still allow members and staff to receive free meals from lobbyists up to $50 in value.
Obama	0	Now, of all the ethics reforms we take up this week, this should be an easy one.
Obama	0	Because I can't think of a single reason in the world why we shouldn't be paying for our own lunches in Washington.
Obama	0	In cities and towns all across America, people pay for their own lunches and their own dinners.
Obama	0	People who make far less than we do.
Obama	0	People who can't afford their medical bills or their mortgages or their kids' tuition.
Obama	0	You ask them if they think that the people they send to Congress should be able to rack up a $50 meal on a lobbyists' dime.
Obama	0	You ask them if they think we should be able feast on free steak dinners at fancy restaurants while they're working two jobs just to put food on their table.
Obama	0	I don't think we need to put a poll in the field to find out the answer to that one.
Obama	0	Now, in no way do I think that any of my colleagues or staffers would exchange votes for meals.
Obama	0	But that's not the point.
Obama	0	It's not just the meal that's the problem, it's the perception.
Obama	0	It's the access that meal gets you.
Obama	0	In the current Washington culture, lobbyists are expected to pick up the tab when they meet with members or staff.
Obama	0	It is simply understood by all sides that the best way to get face time with a member or staffer in order to express your ideas on legislation is to buy them a meal.
Obama	0	But you don't see many members eating $50 meals with constituents who are in town to talk about the issues on their mind or with policy experts who are discussing the latest economic theories.
Obama	0	Most of these meals are with high-priced lobbyists who are advocating on behalf of a specific interest.
Obama	0	The appearance is that they can afford the access, so they get it.
Obama	0	This culture has been around for some time, but it wasn't always that way.
Obama	0	One of the first reforms that Newt Gingrich passed when the Republicans took control of the House in 1995 was an absolute gift and meal ban.
Obama	0	During the debates on this subject, then-Speaker Gingrich said, "The simplest, the cleanest and the clearest standard is to say, 'No gifts'.
Obama	0	There's no way around it.
Obama	0	You didn't get the gift before you were elected.
Obama	0	You ain't gonna get the gift after you leave."
Obama	0	Newt Gingrich was right.
Obama	0	He was right then, and he's right today.
Obama	0	The only reason members and staff are receiving these free meals is because of who they are.
Obama	0	That's not the way we should be doing business in this town - and that's why we should bring the ban back.
Obama	0	This isn't about preventing us from interacting with lobbyists who have legitimate business to discuss, and it isn't about preventing staff from getting the information they need to help us pass better policy.
Obama	0	We can still do all of this if the ban passes, and we can even do it over lunch or dinner.
Obama	0	All we're asking here is to take out your wallet, pull out your credit card, and pay for your own meal.
Obama	0	Everyone else in this country does it - we can do it too.
Obama	0	The American people will be watching and reading about what we do here today.
Obama	0	Eating expensive steak dinners is not why all of us decided to pursue public service, and it's certainly not why the American people elected us to represent them in Washington.
Obama	0	Our constituents expect more from us, and this is our opportunity to live up to those expectations.
Obama	0	That's why I will be voting for Senator Feingold's amendment and that's why I expect my colleagues to do the same.
Obama	0	I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.
Obama	0	Obama’s Opening Statement - Floor Debate on Ethics Reform  TOPIC: Ethics & Lobbying Reform March 7, 2006 Senator Obama's Opening Statement Floor Debate on Ethics Reform Complete Text Mr. President.
Obama	0	Over one hundred years ago, at the dawn of the last century, the Industrial Revolution was beginning to take hold of America, creating unimaginable wealth in sprawling metropolises all across the country.
Obama	0	As factories multiplied and profits grew, the winnings of the new economy became more and more concentrated in the hands of a few robber barons, railroad tycoons and oil magnates.
Obama	0	In the cities, power was maintained by a corrupt system of political machines and ward bosses.
Obama	0	And in the state of New York, there was a young governor who was determined to give government back to the people.
Obama	0	In just his first year, he had already begun to antagonize the state's political machine by attacking its system of favors and corporate giveaways.
Obama	0	He also signed a workers' compensation bill, and even fired the superintendent of insurance for taking money from the very industry he was supposed to be regulating.
Obama	0	None of this sat too well with New York's powerful party boss, who finally plotted to get rid of the reform-minded governor by making sure he was nominated for the Vice Presidency that year.
Obama	0	What no one could have expected is that soon after the election, when President William McKinley was assassinated, the greatest fears of the corrupt machine bosses and powerbrokers came true when that former governor became President of the United States and went on to bust trusts, break up monopolies, and return the government to its people.
Obama	0	His name, of course, was Theodore Roosevelt.
Obama	0	He was a Republican.
Obama	0	And throughout his public life, he demonstrated a willingness to put party and politics aside in order to battle corruption and give people an open, honest government that would fight for their interests and uphold their values.
Obama	0	Today, we face a similar crisis of corruption.
Obama	0	And I believe that we need similar leadership from those in power as well.
Obama	0	The American people are tired of a Washington that's only open to those with the most cash and the right connections.
Obama	0	They're tired of a political process where the vote you cast isn't as important as the favors you can do.
Obama	0	And they're tired of trusting us with their tax dollars when they see them spent on frivolous pet projects and corporate giveaways.
Obama	0	It's not that the games that are played in this town are new or surprising to the public.
Obama	0	People are not naive to the existence of corruption and they know it has worn the face of both Republicans and Democrats over the years.
Obama	0	Moreover, the underlying issue of how extensively money influences politics is the original sin of everyone who's ever run for office - myself included.
Obama	0	In order to get elected, we need to raise vast sums of money by meeting and dealing with people who are disproportionately wealthy.
Obama	0	This is a problem that predates Jack Abramoff.
Obama	0	I agree with those on both sides of the aisle who believe that we shouldn't let half-measures and partisan posturing on campaign finance reform derail our current efforts on ethics and lobbying, but I also think this is an issue and a conversation we must have in the months to come.
Obama	0	Yet, while people know that both parties are vulnerable to these problems, I do think it's fair to say that the scandals we've seen under the current White House and Congress - both legal and illegal - are far worse than most of us could have imagined.
Obama	0	Think about it.
Obama	0	In the past several months, we've seen the head of the White House procurement office arrested.
Obama	0	We've seen some of our most powerful leaders of both the House and the Senate under federal investigation.
Obama	0	We've seen the indictment of Jack Abramoff and his cronies.
Obama	0	And of course, last week, we saw a member of Congress sentenced to eight years in prison for bribery.
Obama	0	Now, some have dismissed these scandals by saying that "everybody does it."
Obama	0	Well, not everybody does it.
Obama	0	And people shouldn't lump together those of us who have to raise funds to run campaigns but do so in a legal and ethical way with those who invite lobbyists in to write bad legislation.
Obama	0	Those aren't equivalent, and we're not being partisan by pointing that out.
Obama	0	The fact is, since our federal government has been controlled by one political party, this kind of scandal has become the regular order of business in this town.
Obama	0	For years now, some on the other side of the aisle have openly bragged about stocking K Street lobbying firms with former staffers to increase their power in Washington, a practice that should stop today and never happen again.
Obama	0	But what's truly offensive to the American people about all of this goes far beyond people like Jack Abramoff.
Obama	0	It's bigger than how much time he'll spend in jail or how many members of Congress he'll turn in.
Obama	0	Bigger than the K Street project and golf junkets to Scotland and lavish gifts for lawmakers.
Obama	0	What's truly offensive about these scandals is that they don't just lead to morally offensive conduct on the part of politicians; they lead to morally offensive legislation that hurts hardworking Americans.
Obama	0	When big oil companies are invited into the White House for secret energy meetings, it's no wonder they end up with billions in tax breaks while most working people struggle to fill up their gas tanks and heat their homes.
Obama	0	When a Committee Chairman negotiates a Medicare bill one day and then negotiates for a job with the drug industry the next, it's hardly a surprise that that industry gets taxpayer-funded giveaways in the same bill that forbids seniors from bargaining for better drug prices.
Obama	0	When the people running Washington are accountable only to the special interests that fund their campaigns, it's not shocking that the American people find their tax dollars being spent with reckless abandon.
Obama	0	Since George Bush took office, we've seen the number of registered lobbyists in Washington double.
Obama	0	In 2004, over $2.1 billion was spent lobbying Congress.
Obama	0	That amounts to over $4.8 million per Member of Congress.
Obama	0	How much do you think the American people were able to spend on their Senators or Representatives last year?
Obama	0	How much money could the folks who can't fill up their gas tanks spend?
Obama	0	How much could the seniors forced to choose between their medications and their groceries spend?
Obama	0	Not $4.8 million.
Obama	0	Not even close.
Obama	0	This is the bigger story here.
Obama	0	The American people believe that the well-connected CEOs and hired guns on K Street who've helped write our laws have gotten what they paid for.
Obama	0	They got all the tax breaks and loopholes and access they could ever want.
Obama	0	But outside this city, the people who can't afford the high-priced lobbyists and don't want to break the law are wondering, "When is it our turn?
Obama	0	When will someone in Washington stand up for me?"
Obama	0	We need to answer that call.
Obama	0	Because while only some are to blame for the corruption that has plagued this city, all are responsible for fixing it.
Obama	0	As you know, I'm from Chicago - a city that hasn't always had the cleanest reputation when it comes to politics in this country.
Obama	0	But during my first year in the Illinois State Senate, I helped lead the fight to pass Illinois' first ethics reform bill in twenty-five years.
Obama	0	I hope we can do something like that here.
Obama	0	But we have to pass a serious bill, and it has to go a long way towards correcting some of the most egregious offenses of the last few years and preventing future offenses as well.
Obama	0	This is not a time for window-dressing or putting a band-aid on a problem just to score political points.
Obama	0	This is a time for real reform.
Obama	0	I think the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which has 41 cosponsors, established the right marker for reform, and I commend Senator Harry Reid and his staff for their hard work in putting it together.
Obama	0	Real reform means making sure that Members of Congress and senior Administration officials wait until they leave office before pursuing jobs with industries they're responsible for regulating.
Obama	0	Billy Tauzin may say he wasn't negotiating for a job with the drug industry at the same time he was negotiating the Medicare bill, but the fact is this: while he was a Member of Congress, he was negotiating for lobbying jobs with not one, but two different industries that he was responsible for regulating: the drug industry and the motion picture association.
Obama	0	That's wrong, and that shouldn't happen anymore.
Obama	0	Real reform means ensuring that a ban on lobbying after members of Congress leave office is real and includes the behind the scenes coordination and supervision activities now used to skirt the ban.
Obama	0	Real reform means giving the public access to now-secret conference committee meetings and posting all bills on the Internet at least a day before they're voted on, so the public can scrutinize what's in them.
Obama	0	Real reform means passing a bill that eliminates all gifts and meals from lobbyists, not just the expensive ones.
Obama	0	And real reform must mean real enforcement.
Obama	0	Because no matter how many new rules we pass, it will mean very little unless you have a system to enforce them.
Obama	0	I commend Senators Lieberman and Collins for their efforts to create such an enforcement mechanism through an independent Office of Public Integrity.
Obama	0	While this proposal doesn't go quite as far as my proposal for an outside ethics fact-finding commission, it's still very good, and I will work with them to try to get it included in this bill.
Obama	0	But to truly earn back the people's trust - to show them that we're working for them and looking out for their interests - we have to do more than just pass a good bill this week.
Obama	0	We have to fundamentally change the way we do business around here.
Obama	0	That means instead of meeting with lobbyists, it's time to start meeting with some of the 45 million Americans with no health care.
Obama	0	Instead of finding cushy political jobs for unqualified buddies, it's time to start finding good-paying jobs for hardworking Americans trying to raise a family.
Obama	0	Instead of hitting up the big firms on K Street, it's time to start visiting the workers on Main Street who wonder how they'll send their kids to college or whether their pension will be around when they retire.
Obama	0	All these people have done to earn access and gain influence is cast their ballot.
Obama	0	But in this democracy, it's all anyone should have to do.
Obama	0	A century ago, that young, reform-minded governor of New York who later became our twenty-sixth President gave us words about our country everyone in this town would do well to listen to today.
Obama	0	Teddy Roosevelt said that, "No republic can permanently endure when its politics are corrupt and base...we can afford to differ on the currency, the tariff, and foreign policy, but we cannot afford to differ on the question of honesty.
Obama	0	There is a soul in the community, a soul in the nation, just exactly as there is a soul in the individual; and exactly as the individual hopelessly mars himself if he lets his conscience be dulled by the constant repetition of unworthy acts, so the nation will hopelessly blunt the popular conscience if it permits its public men continually to do acts which the nation in its heart of hearts knows are acts which cast discredit upon our whole public life."
Obama	0	I hope that this week, we in the Senate will take the first step towards strengthening this nation's soul and bringing credit back to our public life.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Energy Security is National Security - Complete Text  TOPIC: Oil & Alternative Fuels February 28, 2006 Energy Security is National Security Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Governor's Ethanol Coalition Washington, DC Complete Text In this year's State of the Union address, President Bush told us that it was time to get serious about America's addiction to foreign oil.
Obama	0	The next day, we found out that his idea didn't sit too well with the Saudi Royal Family.
Obama	0	A few hours later, Energy Secretary Bodman backtracked and assured the world that even though the President said he planned to reduce the amount of oil we import from the Middle East, he actually didn't mean that literally.
Obama	0	If there's a single example out there that encapsulates the ability of unstable, undemocratic governments to wield undue influence over America's national security just because of our dependence on oil, this is it.
Obama	0	Now, I could stand up here and give you all plenty of reasons why it's a good idea for this country to move away from an oil-based economy.
Obama	0	I could cite studies from scientists and experts and even our own State Department detailing the dangers of global warming - how it can destroy our coastal areas and generate more deadly storms.
Obama	0	I could talk forever about the economic consequences of dependence - how it's decimating our auto industry and costing us jobs and emptying our wallets at the pump.
Obama	0	And I could talk about the millions of new jobs and entire new industries we could create by transitioning to an alternative-fuel economy.
Obama	0	But all we really need to know about the danger of our oil addiction comes directly from the mouths of our enemies: "[Oil] is the umbilical cord and lifeline of the crusader community."
Obama	0	These are the words of Al Qaeda.
Obama	0	"Focus your operations on oil, especially in Iraq and the Gulf area, since this will cause them to die off [on their own]."
Obama	0	These are the words Osama bin Laden.
Obama	0	More than anything else, these comments represent a realization of American weakness shared by the rest of the world.
Obama	0	It's a realization that for all of our military might and economic dominance, the Achilles heel of the most powerful country on Earth is the oil we cannot live without.
Obama	0	Oil single-handedly fuels 96% of our transportation needs, and it's also critical to the manufacture of millions of goods and products in this country.
Obama	0	As we saw during Hurricane Katrina, this kind of dependency means that the loss of even a small amount of oil and refining capacity for just a few days can cause economic panic and soaring prices.
Obama	0	A serious embargo or permanent loss could cause untold disaster.
Obama	0	It would be nice if we could produce our way out of this problem, but it's just not possible.
Obama	0	We only have 3% of the world's oil reserves.
Obama	0	We could start drilling in ANWR today, and at its peak, which would be more than a decade from now, it would give us enough oil to take care of our transportation needs for about a month.
Obama	0	As a result, every single hour we spend $18 million on foreign oil.
Obama	0	It doesn't matter if these countries are budding democracies, despotic regimes, or havens for the madrassas that plant the seeds of terror in young minds - they get our money because we need their oil.
Obama	0	One need only glance at headlines around the world to understand how dangerous this addictive arrangement truly is.
Obama	0	In Iran, Islamic fundamentalists are forging ahead with their nuclear program, knowing full well that the world's response to their actions will be influenced by our need for their oil.
Obama	0	In fact, reports of a $100 billion oil deal between Iran and China were soon followed by China's refusal to press for sanctions against Iran over its nuclear intentions.
Obama	0	In Nigeria, militant rebels have been attacking the country's oil pipelines in recent weeks, sending prices soaring and calling into question the political stability of a country that represents America's fifth-largest source of oil imports.
Obama	0	In Saudi Arabia, Al Qaeda has been attempting attacks on that country's poorly defended oil refineries for years.
Obama	0	On Friday, they almost succeeded as a truck full of explosives was detonated by the shots of security guards just before it entered the refinery.
Obama	0	Even this minor damage caused oil prices to jump $2 in a single day.
Obama	0	But a former CIA agent tells us that if terrorists ever succeeded in destroying an entire oil complex, it could take enough oil off the market to cause economic catastrophe in the United States.
Obama	0	Our enemies are fully aware that they can use oil as a weapon against America.
Obama	0	And if we don't take this threat as seriously as the bombs they build or the guns they buy, we will be fighting the War on Terror with one hand tied behind our back.
Obama	0	Now, the good news about the President's decision to finally focus on energy independence after five years is that it helps build bipartisan consensus that our reliance on foreign oil is a problem and shows that he understands the potential of renewable fuels to make a difference.
Obama	0	The bad news is that the President's energy policy treats our dependence on oil as more of a nuisance than a serious threat.
Obama	0	Just one day after he told us in the State of the Union that renewable fuels were the key to an energy independent future, we learned that the President's budget cuts would force layoffs at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Obama	0	Last week, this made for a rather awkward situation when the President wanted to use the lab for a photo-op - so awkward that the White House actually re-hired the laid-off researchers just to avoid the embarrassment.
Obama	0	This is only one example, but it tells the story of a larger weakness in the President's energy policy: it's simply not commensurate to the challenge.
Obama	0	There's a reason that some have compared the quest for energy independence to the Manhattan Project or the Apollo moon landing.
Obama	0	Like those historic efforts, moving away from an oil economy is a major challenge that will require a sustained national commitment.
Obama	0	During World War II, we had an entire country working around the clock to produce enough planes and tanks to beat the Axis powers.
Obama	0	In the middle of the Cold War, we built a national highway system so we had a quick way to transport military equipment across the country.
Obama	0	When we wanted to beat the Russians into space, we poured millions into a national education initiative that graduated thousands of new scientists and engineers.
Obama	0	If we hope to strengthen our security and control our own foreign policy, we can offer no less of a commitment to energy independence.
Obama	0	But so far, President Bush seems like he is offering less - much less.
Obama	0	His funding for renewable fuels is at the same level it was the day he took office.
Obama	0	He refuses to call for even a modest increase in fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks.
Obama	0	His latest budget funds less then half of the energy bill he himself signed into law - leaving hundreds of millions of dollars in under-funded energy proposals.
Obama	0	And while he cannot seem to find the funding for any of these energy proposals, he has no problem allowing the oil companies to stiff taxpayers $7 billion in royalties that they owe us for drilling on public lands.
Obama	0	These are the same oil companies that are currently enjoying the highest profits on record.
Obama	0	Again, this is just not a serious commitment to energy independence.
Obama	0	The solutions are too timid - the reforms too small.
Obama	0	America's dependence on oil is a major threat to our national security, and the American people deserve a bold commitment that has the full force of their government behind it.
Obama	0	This isn't to lay the blame for our energy problems entirely at the feet of our President.
Obama	0	This is an issue that politicians from both parties clamor about when gas prices are the headline of the month, only to fall back into a trance of inaction once things calm down.
Obama	0	And so we all need to get serious here.
Obama	0	Automakers need to get serious about shifting their technology to greater fuel-efficiency, consumers need to get serious about buying hybrid cars, and Washington needs to get serious about working together to find a real solution to our energy crisis.
Obama	0	Such a solution is not only possible, it's already being implemented in other places around the world.
Obama	0	Countries like Japan are creating jobs and slowing oil consumption by churning out and buying millions of fuel-efficient cars.
Obama	0	Brazil, a nation that once relied on foreign countries to import 80% of its crude oil, will now be entirely self-sufficient in a few years thanks to its investment in biofuels.
Obama	0	So why can't we do this?
Obama	0	Why can't we make energy security one of the great American projects of the 21st century?
Obama	0	The answer is, we can.
Obama	0	The President's energy proposal would reduce our oil imports by 4.5 million barrels per day by 2025.
Obama	0	Not only can we do better than that, we must do better than that if we hope to make a real dent in our oil dependency.
Obama	0	With technology we have on the shelves right now and fuels we can grow right here in America, by 2025 we can reduce our oil imports by over 7.5. million barrels per day - an amount greater than all the oil we are expected to import from the entire Middle East.
Obama	0	We can do this by focusing on two things: the cars we drive and the fuels we use.
Obama	0	First, the cars.
Obama	0	For years, we've hesitated to raise fuel economy standards as a nation in part because of a very legitimate concern - the impact it would have on Detroit.
Obama	0	The auto industry is right when they argue that transitioning to more hybrid and fuel-efficient cars would require massive investment at a time when they're struggling under the weight of rising health care costs, sagging profits, and stiff competition.
Obama	0	But it's precisely because of that competition that they don't have a choice.
Obama	0	China now has a higher fuel economy standard than we do, and Japan's Toyota is doubling production of the popular Prius to sell 100,000 in the U.S. this year.
Obama	0	There is now no doubt that fuel-efficient cars represent the future of the auto industry.
Obama	0	If American car companies hope to be a part of that future - if they hope to survive - they must start building more of these cars.
Obama	0	But that's not to say we should leave the industry to face these costs on its own.
Obama	0	Yes, we should raise fuel economy standards by 3% a year over the next fifteen years, starting in 2008.
Obama	0	With the technology they already have, this should be an achievable goal for automakers.
Obama	0	But we can help them get there.
Obama	0	Right now, one of the biggest costs facing auto manufacturers isn't the cars they make, it's the health care they provide.
Obama	0	Health care costs make up $1,500 of the price of every GM car that's made - more than the cost of steel.
Obama	0	Retiree health care alone cost the Big 3 automakers nearly $6.7 billion just last year.
Obama	0	So here's the deal we can make with the auto companies.
Obama	0	It's a piece of legislation I introduced called "Health Care for Hybrids," and it would allow the federal government to pick up part of the tab for the auto companies' retiree health care costs.
Obama	0	In exchange, the auto companies would then use some of that savings to build and invest in more fuel-efficient cars.
Obama	0	It's a win-win proposal for the industry - their retirees will be taken care of, they'll save money on health care, and they'll be free to invest in the kind of fuel-efficient cars that are the key to their competitive future.
Obama	0	Now, building cars that use less oil is only one side of the equation.
Obama	0	The other involves replacing the oil we use with home-grown biofuels.
Obama	0	The Governors in this room have long known about this potential, and all of you have been leading the way on ethanol in your own states.
Obama	0	This coalition also knows that corn-based ethanol is only the beginning.
Obama	0	If we truly want to harness the power of these fuels and the promise of this market, we can and must generate more cellulosic ethanol from agricultural products like corn stocks, switch grass and other crops our farmers grow.
Obama	0	Already, there are hundreds of fueling stations that use a blend of ethanol and gasoline known as E85, and there are millions of cars on the road with the flexible-fuel tanks necessary to use this fuel - including my own.
Obama	0	But the challenge we face with these biofuels is getting them out of the labs, out of the farms, and onto the wider commercial market.
Obama	0	Every scientific study in the world could sing the praises of biofuels, but you might still be hard-pressed to find an investor willing to take the risk on a cellulosic ethanol plant or a brand-name petroleum company willing to build an E85 fueling station.
Obama	0	The federal government can help in two ways here.
Obama	0	First, we can reduce the risk of investing.
Obama	0	We already do this in a number of ways by funding projects critical to our national security.
Obama	0	Energy independence should be no different.
Obama	0	By developing an Energy Technology Program at the Defense Department, we can provide loan guarantees and venture capital to those with the best plans to develop and sell biofuels on a commercial market.
Obama	0	The Defense Department will also hold a competition where private corporations get funding to see who can build the best new alternative-fuel plant.
Obama	0	The Department can then use these new technologies to improve the energy security of our own military.
Obama	0	Once we take the risk out of investing, the second thing the government can do is to let the private sector know that there will always be a market for renewable fuels.
Obama	0	We can do this in a few ways.
Obama	0	First, we should ramp up the renewable fuel standard and create an alternative diesel standard in this country so that by 2025, 65 billion gallons of alternative fuels per year will be blended into the petroleum supply.
Obama	0	Second, Washington should lead the way on energy independency by making sure that every single automobile the government purchases is a flexible-fuel vehicle - starting today.
Obama	0	When it becomes possible in the coming years, we should make sure that every government car is a plug-in hybrid as well.
Obama	0	Third, I'm supporting legislation that would make sure every single new car in America is a flexible-fuel vehicle within a decade.
Obama	0	Currently it costs manufacturers just $100 to add these tanks to each car.
Obama	0	But we can do them one better.
Obama	0	If they install flexible-fuel tanks in their cars before the decade's up, the government should provide them a $100 tax credit to do it - so there's no excuse for delay.
Obama	0	Fourth, there are already millions of people driving flexible-fuel vehicles who don't know it.
Obama	0	The auto companies shouldn't get CAF'E credit for making these cars if they don't let buyers know about them, so I'd like to ask the industry to follow GM's lead and put a yellow gas cap on all flexible fuel vehicles starting today.
Obama	0	Also, they should send a letter to those people who already have flexible-fuel vehicles so they can start filling up their tank at the closest E85 station.
Obama	0	Finally, since there are only around 500 fueling stations that pump E85 in the country, we recently passed legislation that would provide tax credits of up to $30,000 for those who want to install E85 pumps at their station.
Obama	0	But we should do even more - we should make sure that in the coming years, E85 stations are as easy to find as your gas station is now.
Obama	0	Make no mistake - none of these reforms will come easy, and they won't happen overnight.
Obama	0	But we can't continue to settle for piecemeal, bite-sized solutions to our energy crisis.
Obama	0	We need a national commitment to energy security, and to emphasize that commitment, we should install a Director of Energy Security to oversee all of our efforts.
Obama	0	Like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the National Intelligence Director, this person would be an advisor to the National Security Council and have the full authority to coordinate America's energy policy across all levels of government.
Obama	0	He or she would approve all major budget decisions and provide a full report to Congress and the country every year detailing the progress we're making toward our 2025 goal.
Obama	0	In the days and months after September 11th, Americans were waiting to be called to something bigger than themselves.
Obama	0	Just like their parents and grandparents of the Greatest Generation, they were willing to serve and defend their country - not only on the fields of war, but on the homefront too.
Obama	0	This is our chance to step up and serve.
Obama	0	The war against international terrorism has pitted us against a new kind of enemy that wages terror in new and unconventional ways.
Obama	0	At home, fighting that enemy won't require us to build the massive war machine that Franklin Roosevelt called for so many years ago, but it will require us to harness our own renewable forms of energy so that oil can never be used as a weapon against America.
Obama	0	From farmers and scientists to entrepreneurs and governors, everyone has a role to play in this effort.
Obama	0	In fact, this afternoon I'm sitting down with business and military leaders to discuss this very topic.
Obama	0	Now is the time for serious leadership to get us started down the path of energy independence.
Obama	0	Now is the time for this call to arms.
Obama	0	I hope some of the ideas I've laid out today can serve as a basis for this call, but I also hope that members of both parties and all levels of government can come together in the near future to launch this serious quest for energy independence.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Floor Statment - PATRIOT Act Reauthorization - Complete Text  TOPIC: Homeland Security February 16, 2006 Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama S.2271 - USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization Complete Text Mr. President, four years ago, following one of the most devastating attacks in our nation's history, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act to give our nation's law enforcement the tools they needed to track down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over the world - terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit weaknesses in our laws and our security to carry out even deadlier attacks than we saw on September 11th.
Obama	0	We all agreed that we needed legislation to make it harder for suspected terrorists to go undetected in this country.
Obama	0	Americans everywhere wanted that.
Obama	0	But soon after the PATRIOT Act passed, a few years before I ever arrived in the Senate, I began hearing concerns from people of every background and political leaning that this law didn't just provide law enforcement the powers it needed to keep us safe, but powers it didn't need to invade our privacy without cause or suspicion.
Obama	0	Now, at times this issue has tended to degenerate into an "either-or" type of debate.
Obama	0	Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles.
Obama	0	But that is a false choice.
Obama	0	It asks too little of us and assumes too little about America.
Obama	0	Fortunately, last year, the Senate recognized that this was a false choice.
Obama	0	We put patriotism before partisanship and engaged in a real, open, and substantive debate about how to fix the PATRIOT Act.
Obama	0	And Republicans and Democrats came together to propose sensible improvements to the Act.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, the House was resistant to these changes, and that's why we're voting on the compromise before us.
Obama	0	Let me be clear: this compromise is not as good as the Senate version of the bill, nor is it as good as the SAFE Act that I have cosponsored.
Obama	0	I suspect the vast majority of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle feel the same way.
Obama	0	But, it's still better than what the House originally proposed.
Obama	0	This compromise does modestly improve the PATRIOT Act by strengthening civil liberties protections without sacrificing the tools that law enforcement needs to keep us safe.
Obama	0	In this compromise: We strengthened judicial review of both National Security Letters, the administrative subpoenas used by the FBI, and Section 215 orders, which can be used to obtain medical, financial and other personal records.
Obama	0	We established hard time limits on sneak-and-peak searches and limits on roving wiretaps.
Obama	0	We protected most libraries from being subject to National Security Letters.
Obama	0	We preserved an individual's right to seek counsel and hire an attorney without fearing the FBI's wrath.
Obama	0	And we allowed judicial review of the gag orders that accompany Section 215 searches.
Obama	0	The compromise is far from perfect.
Obama	0	I would have liked to see stronger judicial review of National Security Letters and shorter time limits on sneak and peak searches, among other things.
Obama	0	Sen. Feingold has proposed several sensible amendments - that I support - to address these issues.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, the Majority Leader is preventing Sen. Feingold from offering these amendments through procedural tactics.
Obama	0	That is regrettable because it flies in the face of the bipartisan cooperation that allowed the Senate to pass unanimously its version of the Patriot Act - a version that balanced security and civil liberties, partisanship and patriotism.
Obama	0	The Majority Leader's tactics are even more troubling because we will need to work on a bipartisan basis to address national security challenges in the weeks and months to come.
Obama	0	In particular, members on both sides of the aisle will need to take a careful look at President Bush's use of warrantless wiretaps and determine the right balance between protecting our security and safeguarding our civil liberties.
Obama	0	This is a complex issue.
Obama	0	But only by working together and avoiding election-year politicking will we be able to give our government the necessary tools to wage the war on terror without sacrificing the rule of law.
Obama	0	So, I will be supporting the Patriot Act compromise.
Obama	0	But I urge my colleagues to continue working on ways to improve the civil liberties protections in the Patriot Act after it is reauthorized.
Obama	0	I thank the chair and yield the floor.
Obama	0	Darfur: Current Policy Not Enough Security - Podcast Transcript  TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense February 15, 2006 Darfur: Current Policy Not Enough Security Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama, and today is Wednesday, February 15, 2006.
Obama	0	For more than two years now, we have been watching a rolling genocide take place in Darfur, western Sudan.
Obama	0	Many of you I'm sure are aware of the tragedy that has been unfolding there.
Obama	0	For those of you who are not, essentially what we have seen is a systematic targeting on the part of the Khartoum government and the Janjaweed Arab militia that have systematically uprooted, killed, murdered, pillaged, raped, Africans, driven them from their homes into enormous displaced-person camps.
Obama	0	Refugee camps, within Sudan.
Obama	0	It's estimated that at least 300,000 people have been killed.
Obama	0	It's known that at least 2 million people have been displaced.
Obama	0	The administration early on in this tragedy acknowledged that this was genocide that was taking place.
Obama	0	I think there has been broad recognition in the international community that the behavior of the Sudanese government has been scandalous.
Obama	0	The rationale that has provided from the Sudanese government for what has been taking place is that there is a battle going on between Sudanese government and rebels that operate within the area.
Obama	0	But, the real victims have not been rebel sympathizers, or the rebels themselves, they've been innocent men, women and children.
Obama	0	For more than a year now, I've been working with other Senators to see what we can do to really push the Administration to take this as seriously as it warrants.
Obama	0	To the Administration's credit, the United States government has probably paid more attention to this issue than some of our European allies.
Obama	0	We have been a major contributor of aid to the region; we have helped to finance the African Union, to provide peace-keeping forces in the Darfur area.
Obama	0	So, in a lot of ways, the United States government has been much more on top of this than Europeans, Canadians, and others, who oftentimes accuse the Untied States of being indifferent to the problems of the third world.
Obama	0	On the other hand, what has been done is not enough.
Obama	0	The few thousand African Union troops who have been placed in Darfur are primarily providing witness to some of the atrocities that are taking place there, but they don't have clear rules of engagement, they are under-armed, under-trained, they don't really provide the sort of protective force that would be needed to not only ensure that existing villages aren't ravaged by the Janjaweeds, but more importantly, that the 2 million displaced people could actually safely start returning home.
Obama	0	Recent reports indicate that in the past few weeks alone, more than 20,000 people have been displaced.
Obama	0	There are also indications that the Janjaweed, recognizing that the AU forces, the African Union forces, are not particularly effective, have started targeting them.
Obama	0	So there is a sense of deterioration in Darfur, the situation may be getting worse, rather than better.
Obama	0	And, what's most disturbing is that the United States government seems to be backing off a little bit, the commitment that it made to deal with the problem.
Obama	0	There was a quote from the under-secretary for African Affairs, Secretary Frasier, in which she indicated that, maybe this was not a genocide after all.
Obama	0	And, if that ends up being the United State's attitude, then we could see continuing problems of a scale that might eventually reach the same scale in which happened in Rwanda.
Obama	0	So, here are a couple of things that we think need to happen.
Obama	0	Number one: we need a UN peace-keeping mission in Darfur.
Obama	0	There have been conversations; the UN Secretary General, Koffee Annan, the AU forces, and the Bush Administration have all acknowledged this.
Obama	0	There's got to be a sense of urgency in which the US diplomatic efforts are focused on getting this UN peace-keeping force up to about 20,000 troops, and placing them in Darfur as quickly as possible with a strong protection mandate, rather than a monitoring one.
Obama	0	In the mean time, it's going to take about year, at best, to get a UN peace-keeping force in place.
Obama	0	We're going to have to supply and rally, bridging money and forces for the AU throughout this year, because, since it's sort of in lame-duck status, the Janjaweed recognize that AU forces are not particularly effective, they may become more and more of a target.
Obama	0	We're going to have to provide this successor UN force with our own lift and logistic assets.
Obama	0	We're going to have to provide our military hardware, like transport and attack helicopters, and so forth.
Obama	0	And, we're going to have to really force other countries like Canada, Australia, some of the European countries that are not engaged in peace-keeping in other places, or at least are not immediately involved in major activity in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, as we are, to deliver the troops that are needed.
Obama	0	So, it is absolutely critical that we start focusing on this now.
Obama	0	The situation, as bad as it is, could deteriorate further.
Obama	0	This is something that is of interest, I think, to all of us, not just for humanitarian reasons, although when you read the accounts of women being raped when they are out collecting firewood, when you read just horrendous accounts of entire villages being decimated and children being murdered, that it just breaks your heart, and humanitarian concerns should be sufficient, but we also have a strong national security interest.
Obama	0	If you start seeing more and more failed states, more and more displaced persons, more and more refugees, all of that becomes a breeding ground for terrorist activity, it becomes a breeding ground for disease, and it creates refugees that put pressure on our own borders.
Obama	0	In an inner-connected world we can't insulate ourselves from these tragedies.
Obama	0	So, we're going to, over time, have to develop some strategy as the world's remaining super-power to address these issues, and Darfur is an important test case.
Obama	0	We've already failed one test in Rwanda, we shouldn't fail another.
Obama	0	Anyway, if you are interested in the issues related to Darfur, you can always contact my office, or get on the website.
Obama	0	Your voice is obviously critical in this issue.
Obama	0	I appreciate you, as always listening in.
Obama	0	Thank you for downloading, and I will talk to you next week.
Obama	0	Bye bye.
Obama	0	Opening Statement - Lugar-Obama legislation S1949  TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense February 9, 2006 Foreign Relations Committee Lugar-Obama legislation S.1949 Complete Text Mr. Chairman, I can't do a better job of laying out the issue than you just did, so I am going to keep my opening remarks relatively short.
Obama	0	I want to thank you for your tireless leadership on this issue; for holding this hearing; and for working with me to introduce what I believe is a very good bill.
Obama	0	I also want to thank Senator Biden for his insightful comments and his long track record of good work on nonproliferation issues.
Obama	0	The Lugar-Obama legislation, S.1949, does two basic things.
Obama	0	First, it enhances our ability, working with friends and allies, to detect and intercept illegal shipments of weapons and materials of mass destruction.
Obama	0	Second, the bill bolsters ongoing efforts to destroy conventional weapons such as lightweight anti-aircraft missiles.
Obama	0	As the Chairman pointed out in his opening statement, many of these efforts are under-funded, fragmented, and in need of high-level support.
Obama	0	I take note of the Chairman's comments that new threat reduction proposals - even the Nunn-Lugar program - are not always warmly received by the Executive Branch.
Obama	0	I agree with your testimony Secretary Joseph that the Department does need flexibility to deal effectively with global threats and international diplomacy.
Obama	0	But that isn't the issue here before us today.
Obama	0	Every Member of this Committee wants to give the State Department the flexibility it needs.
Obama	0	This issue here today is whether the State Department could use additional resources and coordination to more effectively deal with two critically important threats - interdiction of WMD and destruction of conventional weapons.
Obama	0	I believe it can.
Obama	0	I am also concerned that the issue just simply does not get the attention it deserves within the State Department.
Obama	0	I know that both the President and Secretary Rice have expressed their commitment to nonproliferation issues.
Obama	0	But, four key State Department interdiction and nonproliferation programs are either flat-lined or slated for only modest of increases in the President's budget.
Obama	0	Meanwhile, a $1.2 billion increase is proposed for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), which will provide funding to nations such as Cape Verde, Madagascar, and Vanuatu.
Obama	0	I am supportive of the MCA, and I am not saying that these countries aren't worthy of U.S. assistance.
Obama	0	But, a budget is about prioritizing strategic objectives.
Obama	0	And, in my view, the priorities don't appropriately align with the strategic threats we confront today.
Obama	0	Secretary Joseph, despite my concerns, I am hopeful that we can work together to make adjustments to our budget priorities.
Obama	0	With regard to Lugar-Obama, I am also confident that we can work in a collaborative spirit to make a good bill even better.
Obama	0	I look forward to your testimony.
Obama	0	Obama's Floor Statement on the Hurricane Katrina Child Assistance Amendment  TOPIC: Katrina & Gulf Recovery February 1, 2006 Senator Obama's Floor Statement Hurricane Katrina Child Assistance Amendment Complete Text  Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation bill that I intend to offer at the appropriate time.
Obama	0	The Amendment achieves two goals.
Obama	0	First, it helps keep a promise the President made to rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.
Obama	0	Second, in a $70 billion bill laden with tax cuts for the wealthy and well-connected, it sets aside less than 1 percent for the neediest in our society.
Obama	0	Two weeks after Katrina made landfall, President Bush stood in the ruins of New Orleans and vowed to "do what it takes" to help the region recover.
Obama	0	He also acknowledged the terrifying images of abject poverty that struck Americans on their TV screens and said, "We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action."
Obama	0	Five months later, the President's timid actions have not matched his bold rhetoric.
Obama	0	He has not lived up to his promises.
Obama	0	My amendment uses a cost-effective and proven tool in our tax code--the Child Tax Credit--to extend aid to low-income working families affected by Hurricane Katrina.
Obama	0	Enacted in 1997, the Child Credit allows families with qualifying children to receive a credit of $1,000 per child against their federal income tax.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, the credit is skewed so that many families who need it the most can't get it.
Obama	0	Under current law, families that earn less than $11,000 get no benefit from the refundable child credit.
Obama	0	That means that a child is left out of the credit even if her parent works full time at minimum wage, which has not increased since 1997.
Obama	0	And the child doesn't get the full benefit of the $1000 credit until her parent earns close to $18,000, or even more if the child has siblings.
Obama	0	What's worse: if her parents' incomes stagnate, are disrupted for any reason, or the economy stalls and work hours or wages are reduced, the value of the credit drops or even disappears.
Obama	0	Under current law, almost 17 million children get less than the full credit.
Obama	0	We all know what happened to the families on the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Katrina, and it will be a long time before these families can rebuild their lives.
Obama	0	Many of the families in the affected states were evacuated to other areas, and many of them cannot even afford to go back.
Obama	0	And the federal response so far has been inadequate to get these families effectively back on their feet.
Obama	0	We need to do better.
Obama	0	At a time when we are debating $70 billion of tax breaks, many of which will benefit those who need the least help, it is critical that we remember the worst off and the most vulnerable members of our society.
Obama	0	When I went to Houston after the Hurricane, I met an evacuee from New Orleans who said to me: "we had nothing before the hurricane, and now we've got less than nothing."
Obama	0	Life was hard for many families even before Katrina hit.
Obama	0	In Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, for example, more than 900,000 children under 17 years old were so poor that they got no child tax credit or only a partial credit.
Obama	0	These states had among the highest rates of children too poor to get the full credit.
Obama	0	In fact, more than 1/3 of the children in Mississippi and Louisiana didn't get the full benefit of the child tax credit.
Obama	0	This amendment, at a cost of less than 1 percent of the overall Tax Reconciliation bill, will provide necessary assistance to many of these families.
Obama	0	The amendment eliminates the income threshold that excluded all children in families with less than $11,000 of income.
Obama	0	My amendment sends a simple message: if you work, your kids get a benefit.
Obama	0	It provides a partial credit starting with the first dollar of a parent's income for families who lived in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina.
Obama	0	The amendment is simple: it says that the children of low-income working parents affected by Hurricane Katrina will no longer be denied the child credit.
Obama	0	You work, your kids get a benefit.
Obama	0	If you don't work, no benefit.
Obama	0	And if you want the full benefit, you have to earn at least $10,000, which is just about the income of a full time job at minimum wage.
Obama	0	That's a common sense way to support families with children, especially families that have experienced the huge cost - psychological and financial - of a natural disaster.
Obama	0	My amendment is also narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible.
Obama	0	It is aimed at families affected by the Hurricanes, and it provides short-term support, expiring in 2008.
Obama	0	With this amendment, hundreds of thousands of this country's most disadvantaged children will see an increase in their credit.
Obama	0	Katrina offered us a window into America's poverty.
Obama	0	Let's not let that window close without doing something to provide a chance for America's children to rebuild their lives with dignity, hope, and opportunity.
Obama	0	I yield the floor.
Obama	0	Obama to Vote No on the Nomination of Judge Alito - Podcast Transcript  TOPIC: Confirmations January 31 2006 Obama to Vote No on the Nomination of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court Complete Podcast Transcript Hello, this is Barack Obama, and today is Tuesday, January 31, 2006.
Obama	0	As many of you may be aware, today is the vote to confirm Judge Alito the Unites States Supreme Court.
Obama	0	There's been a lot of discussion in the country about how the Senate should approach the confirmation process.
Obama	0	There's some who believe that the President, having won the election, should have complete authority to appoint the nominee, and that the Senate should only examine whether or not the Justice is intellectually capable and is nice to his wife, or she is nice to her husband.
Obama	0	That, once you get beyond issues of intellect and personal character, then there shouldn't be further question as to whether the Judge should be confirmed.
Obama	0	I disagree with the view.
Obama	0	I believe that the Constitution calls for the Senate to advise and consent, that, meaningful advice and consent includes an examination of a judge's philosophy, ideology, and record.
Obama	0	When I examine the philosophy, ideology, and record of Judge Samuel Alito, I am deeply troubled.
Obama	0	I have no doubt that Judge Alito has the training and qualifications necessary to serve as a Supreme Court Justice.
Obama	0	He's a smart guy, there's no indication that he is not a man of good character.
Obama	0	But, when you look at his record, what is clear is that when it comes to his understanding of the Constitution, he consistently sides on behalf of the powerful against the powerless.
Obama	0	If there is a case involving an employer and an employee, and the Supreme Court has not given clear direction, Judge Alito will rule in favor of the employer.
Obama	0	If there is a claim between prosecutors and defendants, if the Supreme Court has not already a clear rule of decision then, Judge Alito will rule in favor of the state.
Obama	0	When it comes to how checks and balances in our system are supposed to operate, the balance of power between the executive branch, Congress, and the judiciary, Judge Alito consistently sides with the notion that a president should not be constrained by either Congressional acts, or the check of the judiciary.
Obama	0	He believes in the overarching power of the president to engage in whatever the president deems to be appropriate policy.
Obama	0	As a consequence of this, I'm extraordinarily worried about how Judge Alito might approach issues such as wire tapping, monitoring of emails, or other privacy concerns that we have seen surface over the last several months.
Obama	0	In sum, I've seen an extraordinarily consistent attitude on the part of Judge Alito that does not uphold the traditional role of the Supreme Court as a bastion of equality and justice for the United States citizen, and for that reason, I will be voting against his confirmation.
Obama	0	I do hope that if Judge Alito is confirmed, he proves me wrong.
Obama	0	I know that all the Senators who will be voting against him ardently hope that the Supreme Court continues to serve the vital role that it plays in preserving our liberties.
Obama	0	Thank you very much; I will talk to you guys next week.
Obama	0	Confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito, Jr.
Obama	0	Floor Statement  TOPIC: Confirmations Thursday, January 26, 2006 Floor Statement on the Confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito, Jr.
Obama	0	Complete Text First off, let me congratulate Senators Specter and Leahy for moving yet another confirmation process along with a civility that speaks well of the Senate.
Obama	0	As we all know, there's been a lot of discussion in the country about how the Senate should approach this confirmation process.
Obama	0	There are some who believe that the President, having won the election, should have the complete authority to appoint his nominee, and the Senate should only examine whether or not the Justice is intellectually capable and an all-around nice guy.
Obama	0	That once you get beyond intellect and personal character, there should be no further question whether the judge should be confirmed.
Obama	0	I disagree with this view.
Obama	0	I believe firmly that the Constitution calls for the Senate to advise and consent.
Obama	0	I believe that it calls for meaningful advice and consent that includes an examination of a judge's philosophy, ideology, and record.
Obama	0	And when I examine the philosophy, ideology, and record of Samuel Alito, I'm deeply troubled.
Obama	0	I have no doubt that Judge Alito has the training and qualifications necessary to serve.
Obama	0	He's an intelligent man and an accomplished jurist.
Obama	0	And there's no indication he's not a man of great character.
Obama	0	But when you look at his record - when it comes to his understanding of the Constitution, I have found that in almost every case, he consistently sides on behalf of the powerful against the powerless; on behalf of a strong government or corporation against upholding American's individual rights.
Obama	0	If there is a case involving an employer and an employee and the Supreme Court has not given clear direction, he'll rule in favor of the employer.
Obama	0	If there's a claim between prosecutors and defendants, if the Supreme Court has not provided a clear rule of decision, then he'll rule in favor of the state.
Obama	0	He's rejected countless claims of employer discrimination, even refusing to give some plaintiffs a hearing for their case.
Obama	0	He's refused to hold corporations accountable numerous times for dumping toxic chemicals into water supplies, even against the decisions of the EPA.
Obama	0	He's overturned a jury verdict that found a company liable for being a monopoly when it had over 90% of the market share at the time.
Obama	0	It's not just his decisions in these individual cases that give me pause - it's that decisions like these are the rule for Samuel Alito, not the exception.
Obama	0	When it comes to how checks and balances in our system are supposed to operate - the balance of power between the Executive Branch, Congress, and the Judiciary, Judge Alito consistently sides with the notion that a President should not be constrained by either Congressional acts or the check of the Judiciary.
Obama	0	He believes in the overarching power of the President to engage in whatever the President deems to be appropriate policy.
Obama	0	As a consequence of this, I'm extraordinarily worried about how Judge Alito might approach issues like wiretapping, monitoring of emails, or other privacy concerns that we've seen surface over the last several months.
Obama	0	In sum, I've seen an extraordinarily consistent attitude on the part of Judge Alito that does not uphold the traditional role of the Supreme Court as a bastion of equality and justice for United States citizens.
Obama	0	Should he be confirmed, I hope that he proves me wrong.
Obama	0	I hope that he shows the independence that I think is absolutely necessary in order for us to preserve our liberties and protect our citizens.
Obama	0	LOBBYING REFORM SUMMIT  TOPIC: Ethics & Lobbying Reform January 26, 2006 Lobbying Reform Summit Lobbying Reform Summit National Press Club Washington, DC Complete Text Good morning.
Obama	0	I want to start by thanking American University and the Committee for Economic Development for hosting this panel today.
Obama	0	It's an honor to be here and an honor to be among such great company.
Obama	0	Over one hundred years ago, at the dawn of the last century, the Industrial Revolution was beginning to take hold of America, creating unimaginable wealth in sprawling metropolises all across the country.
Obama	0	As factories multiplied and profits grew, the winnings of the new economy became more and more concentrated in the hands of a few robber barons, railroad tycoons and oil magnates.
Obama	0	In the cities, power was maintained by a corrupt system of political machines and ward bosses.
Obama	0	And in the state of New York, there existed a young governor who was determined to give government back to the people.
Obama	0	In just his first year, he had already begun to antagonize the state's political machine by attacking its system of favors and corporate giveaways.
Obama	0	He also signed a workers' compensation bill, and even fired the superintendent of insurance for taking money from the very industry he was supposed to be regulating.
Obama	0	None of this sat too well with New York's powerful party boss, who finally plotted to get rid of the reform-minded governor by making sure he was nominated for the Vice Presidency that year.
Obama	0	What no one could have expected is that soon after the election, when President William McKinley was assassinated, the greatest fears of the corrupt machine bosses and powerbrokers came true when that former governor became President of the United States and went on to bust trusts, break up monopolies, and return the government to its people.
Obama	0	His name, of course, was Theodore Roosevelt.
Obama	0	He was a Republican.
Obama	0	And throughout his public life, he demonstrated a willingness to put party and politics aside in order to battle corruption and give people an open, honest government that would fight for their interests and uphold their values.
Obama	0	Today, we face a similar crisis of corruption.
Obama	0	And I believe that we deserve similar leadership from those in power as well.
Obama	0	The American people are tired of a Washington that's only open to those with the most cash and the right connections.
Obama	0	They're tired of a political process where the vote you cast isn't as important as the favors you can do.
Obama	0	And they're tired of trusting us with their tax dollars when they see them spent on frivolous pet projects and corporate giveaways.
Obama	0	It's not that the games that are played in this town are new or surprising to the public.
Obama	0	People are not naive to the existence of corruption and they know it has worn the face of both Republicans and Democrats over the years.
Obama	0	Moreover, the underlying issue of how extensively money influences politics is the original sin of everyone who's ever run for office - myself included.
Obama	0	In order to get elected, we need to raise vast sums of money by meeting and dealing with people who are disproportionately wealthy.
Obama	0	This is a problem that predates George Bush or Jack Abramoff, and I believe that a serious, bipartisan conversation about campaign finance reform is one that this town would do well to have in the months to come.
Obama	0	Yet, while people are familiar with these problems and they encompass both parties, I do think it's fair to say that the scandals we've seen under the current White House and Congress - both legal and illegal - are far worse than most of us could have imagined.
Obama	0	Think about it.
Obama	0	In the past several months, we've seen politicians resigning for taking millions of dollars in bribes.
Obama	0	We've seen the head of the White House procurement office arrested.
Obama	0	We've seen some of our most powerful leaders of both the House and the Senate under federal investigation.
Obama	0	We've seen the number of registered lobbyists in Washington double since George Bush came into office.
Obama	0	And of course, we've seen the indictment of Jack Abramoff and his cronies.
Obama	0	Now, there's an argument made that somehow this is a bipartisan scandal.
Obama	0	And the defense here is that everybody does it.
Obama	0	Well, not everybody does it.
Obama	0	And people shouldn't lump together those of us who have to raise funds to run campaigns but do so in a legal and ethical way with those who invite lobbyists in to write bad legislation.
Obama	0	Those aren't equivalent, and we're not being partisan by pointing that out.
Obama	0	The fact is, since this Republican leadership has come to power, this kind of scandal has been the regular order of business in this town.
Obama	0	For years now, they have openly bragged about stocking K Street lobbying firms with former leadership staffers to increase their power in Washington.
Obama	0	And yet, what is truly offensive to the American people about all of this goes far beyond people like Jack Abramoff.
Obama	0	It's bigger than how much time he'll spend in jail or how many Republicans he'll turn in.
Obama	0	Bigger than the K Street project and golf junkets to Scotland and lavish gifts for lawmakers.
Obama	0	What's truly offensive about these scandals is that they don't just lead to morally offensive conduct on the part of politicians; they lead to morally offensive legislation that hurts hardworking Americans.
Obama	0	Because when big oil companies are invited into the White House for secret energy meetings, it's no wonder they end up with billions in tax breaks while Americans still struggle to fill up their gas tanks and heat their homes.
Obama	0	When a Committee Chairman negotiates a Medicare bill at the same time he's negotiating for a job as the drug industry's lobbyist, it's hardly a surprise when that industry gets taxpayer-funded giveaways in the same bill that forbids seniors from bargaining for better drug prices.
Obama	0	When the people running Washington are accountable only to the special interests that fund their campaigns, of course they'll spend your tax dollars with reckless abandon; of course they'll load up bills with pet projects and drive us into deficit with the hope that no one will notice.
Obama	0	In 2004, over $2.1 billion was spent lobbying Congress.
Obama	0	That amounts to over $4.8 million per Member of Congress.
Obama	0	$4.8 million per member so that oil companies can still run our energy policy and pharmaceutical companies can still raise our drug prices and special interests can still waste our tax dollars on pet projects.
Obama	0	How much do you think the American people were able to spend on their Senator or Representative last year?
Obama	0	How much money could the folks who can't fill up their gas tanks spend?
Obama	0	How much could the seniors forced to choose between their medications and their groceries spend?
Obama	0	Not $4.8 million.
Obama	0	Not even close.
Obama	0	This is the bigger story here, and this is why the recent scandals have shaken the American people's faith in a government that will look out for their interests and uphold their values.
Obama	0	The well-connected CEOs and hired guns on K Street who've helped write our laws have gotten what they paid for.
Obama	0	They got all the tax breaks and loopholes and access they could ever want.
Obama	0	But outside this city, the people who can't afford the high-priced lobbyists and don't want to break the law are wondering, "When is it our turn?
Obama	0	When will someone in Washington stand up for me?"
Obama	0	We need to answer that call because let's face it - for the last few years, the people running Washington simply haven't.
Obama	0	And while only some are to blame for the corruption that has plagued this city, all are responsible for fixing it.
Obama	0	Now, I've been asked by my caucus to take a role in lobbying reform - a role I'm proud to have.
Obama	0	As many of you know I'm from Chicago - a city that hasn't always had the cleanest reputation when it comes to politics in this country.
Obama	0	But during my first year in the Illinois State Senate, I helped lead the fight to pass Illinois' first ethics reform bill in twenty-five years.
Obama	0	I hope we can do something like that here.
Obama	0	I realize there are many proposals floating around out there, and I also realize that our friends on the other side of the aisle have many of their own.
Obama	0	I think that's commendable.
Obama	0	In fact, I look forward to working in a bipartisan fashion to get a solid bill passed.
Obama	0	But this has to be a serious bill, and it has to go a long way toward correcting some of the most egregious offenses of the last few years.
Obama	0	This is not a time for window-dressing or putting a band-aid on a problem just to score political points.
Obama	0	This is a time for real reform, and I think the Democrats' Honest Leadership and Open Government Act does this by including provisions that so far the Republican proposals do not.
Obama	0	Real reform means making sure that Members of Congress and the Administration tell us when they're negotiating for jobs with industries they're responsible for regulating.
Obama	0	That way we don't have people writing a drug bill during the day and meeting with pharmaceutical companies about their future salary at night.
Obama	0	Real reform means giving the public access to now-secret conference committee meetings and posting all bills on the Internet 24 hours before they're voted on, so the public can scrutinize what's in them.
Obama	0	Real reform means passing a bill that eliminates all gifts and meals from lobbyists, not just the expensive ones.
Obama	0	If the we truly agree that having a lobbyist constantly pick up the tab for lunch can help influence legislation, then they'll have no problem changing their position so that the ban includes meals of any price.
Obama	0	Real reform means ending the no-bid contracts for well-connected contributors that have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars in both Iraq and the Gulf Coast.
Obama	0	And it means ending the practice of appointing your political buddies to positions they are wholly unqualified for.
Obama	0	It means no more Brownies.
Obama	0	Finally, I think that real reform must include real oversight and accountability.
Obama	0	Our bill sets up an independent Office of Public Integrity to keep an eye on lobbyists and to make sure they comply with the rules.
Obama	0	Now, personally, I think that there's an opportunity for us to go even further than some of the proposals that have come from both parties.
Obama	0	And that's why last week I introduced the CLEAN UP Act, which would build on the Democrats' reform bill by giving the American public a clearer view of what's going on here in Washington.
Obama	0	See, one of the reasons why lobbyists like Abramoff and their allies in Congress have been able to manipulate the system is because most of their backroom deals are done in secret.
Obama	0	Just the other day, we heard that because of pressure from health care industry lobbyists, Republican negotiators met behind closed doors and changed a budget bill to provide a $22 billion giveaway to HMOs -- $22 billion that would come right out of the pockets of American taxpayers.
Obama	0	But of course, no one knew about the change until much later, and no lawmaker would admit to making it.
Obama	0	This is an outrage, and my bill would change this by identifying secret provisions like these that weren't in the original bill, and it would let the public know who put them there, so that special interest giveaways couldn't be slipped in at the last minute.
Obama	0	My bill also would shine the spotlight on those pet projects that lawmakers sneak into every spending bill by requiring that they earmarks be posted on the internet 72 hours before they're voted on.
Obama	0	The watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, recently endorsed this bill, and I hope that the Senate will take it up soon.
Obama	0	Let me close with one final point.
Obama	0	Even if we pass a good bill and rid Washington of the Jack Abramoffs of the world, it's going to take much more than gift bans and lobbying reform to restore the public's faith in a government.
Obama	0	It will take not simply a change in laws, but a change in attitudes.
Obama	0	To do this - to earn back that trust - to show people that we're working for them and looking out for their interests - we have to start acting like it.
Obama	0	That means instead of meeting with lobbyists, it's time to start meeting with some of the 45 million Americans with no health care.
Obama	0	Instead of finding cushy political jobs for unqualified buddies, it's time to start finding good-paying jobs for hardworking Americans trying to raise a family.
Obama	0	Instead of hitting up the big firms on K Street, it's time to start visiting the workers on Main Street who wonder how they'll send their kids to college or whether their pension will be around when they retire.
Obama	0	All these people have done to earn access and gain influence is cast their ballot.
Obama	0	But in this democracy, it's all anyone should have to do.
Obama	0	A century ago, that young, reform-minded governor of New York who later became our twenty-sixth President gave us words about our country everyone in this town would do well to listen to today.
Obama	0	Teddy Roosevelt said that, "No republic can permanently endure when its politics are corrupt and base...we can afford to differ on the currency, the tariff, and foreign policy, but we cannot afford to differ on the question of honesty.
Obama	0	There is a soul in the community, a soul in the nation, just exactly as their is a soul in the individual; and exactly as the individual hopelessly mars himself if he lets his conscience be dulled by the constant repetition of unworthy acts, so the nation will hopelessly blunt the popular conscience if it permits its public men continually to do acts which the nation in its heart of hearts knows are acts which cast discredit upon our whole public life."
Obama	0	I can only hope that in the weeks to come, the work we do here and in Congress will once again strengthen this nation's soul and bring credit back to our public life.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Meeting on Iraq with President Bush - Podcast - Complete Transcript  TOPIC: Iraq January 25, 2006 Meeting on Iraq with President Bush Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rice and Secretary Rumsfeld Complete Podcast Transcript Hello everybody, this is Senator Barack Obama, and today is Wednesday, January 25, 2006.
Obama	0	First of all, let me say that I am glad to be back from the Middle East.
Obama	0	It was a wonderful trip, but it is good to be back in the States.
Obama	0	It was especially good to hug my kids and my wife.
Obama	0	So in case they're listening out there, I love them, and appreciate them.
Obama	0	I also want to apologize for some of you who have listened to our last couple of podcasts.
Obama	0	I know I was a little bit long in each of those pod casts, but when you're on the road talking into a cell phone, sometimes you loose track of time.
Obama	0	I obviously had a lot of information I wanted to transmit.
Obama	0	I appreciate you guys bearing with me.
Obama	0	I will try to be as succinct as possible in the future.
Obama	0	Today I just had a meeting with George Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, Vice-President Cheney, and Condoleezza Rice, as well as some other officials, to discuss the situation in Iraq.
Obama	0	Myself with eight other senators had a frank exchange of views as to what is taking place in Iraq, and how we can improve the situation there.
Obama	0	As many of you know, this is a difficult issue for me because I was strongly opposed to the war; felt very strongly that once we were in, it would be very difficult to extract ourselves honorably.
Obama	0	Now that we are in, I believe we need to bring our troops home as quickly as possible, but to do so in a way that does not precipitate all out civil war in Iraq.
Obama	0	As I indicated in my pod cast from Iraq, what was clear to me from my visit was that there is no military solution to the problem in Iraq, that the only way we're going to solve the situation there is for all the parties involved to arrive at a political accommodation.
Obama	0	In the discussions that we had, I reiterated that view to the president.
Obama	0	Ambassador Kaizaad participated in the meeting, as did General Casey.
Obama	0	They gave us an update in terms of political situation there.
Obama	0	One of the biggest concerns, as I may have mentioned in previous pod casts is that the police and defense security forces in Iraq in particular that are there have to be governed by non-sectarian leadership that the ministries of the interior and defense cannot be subject to the say of either Shia militias or Sunni militias.
Obama	0	They have to operate professionally to generate trust from the general public.
Obama	0	I also pointed out to the president what I heard in Iraq in regards to reconstruction.
Obama	0	How vital it was to have competent institutions in place that would show the Iraqi people that a unified central government would work to improve their lives in a concrete way.
Obama	0	Another point of discussion had to do with troop levels.
Obama	0	Obviously, I am extremely interested, as a number of the other Senators were, in figuring out when we can actually start brining troops home.
Obama	0	We tried to press both the President and other members of the administration on how we can start reducing troop levels in a meaningful way.
Obama	0	I do believe that some progress has been made as respect to training of Iraqi security forces.
Obama	0	If in fact we are seeing more trained Iraqis, both in the police and security apparatus, then it seems to me that we should be able to start rotating some of our troops out.
Obama	0	We didn't get any firms commitments from the president, but that is something that we will continue to press them on.
Obama	0	There was one final point that came up in discussion.
Obama	0	The president insisted that regardless of whether or not agreed about going into Iraq, that all Americans had a stake in the success of Iraqi democracy.
Obama	0	I agree with that proposition.
Obama	0	I also shared with the President my belief, however, that bipartisanship can only work if the administration and political operatives within the White House are not using national security as a means of supporting chief political points.
Obama	0	Obviously that is not something that is restrictive to Republicans; Democrats do it as well sometimes.
Obama	0	But, the stakes are too high to suggest that Democrats who have critiqued the war effort, or have dissenting views are un-American.
Obama	0	I am hopeful that out of this conversation there is some discussion and consideration of these issues within the White House.
Obama	0	So, thanks for listening, everybody.
Obama	0	I appreciate it, and I will talk to you next week.
Obama	0	We'll probably have some discussion, at that time, about the Alito nomination.
Obama	0	Honest Leadership and Open Government - Podcast Transcript  TOPIC: Ethics & Lobbying Reform January 18, 2006 Honest Leadership and Open Government Podcast - Complete Transcript As most of you know, I'm from Chicago - a city that hasn't always had the cleanest reputation when it comes to politics in this country.
Obama	0	In fact, one of the most famous moments in Chicago political life came back in the 50s, when one of Chicago's old-time ward bosses, a guy named Paddy Bauer, was reported to have danced on his chair after the Chicago machine defeated a reform candidate and shouted out for the entire chamber to hear, that "Chicago ain't ready for reform."
Obama	0	I stand here today with my colleagues to say that the American people are ready for reform.
Obama	0	In fact, the American people think reform is long overdue.
Obama	0	Now, let me say at the outset that none of us claim that the Democrats have a monopoly on virtue.
Obama	0	Moreover, political corruption is not unique to Washington.
Obama	0	During my first year in the Illinois State Senate, I helped lead the fight to pass Illinois' first ethics reform bill in twenty-five years - in part to address some of the questionable practices that were going on in Springfield.
Obama	0	But I think it's fair to say that the scandals that we've seen, both legal and illegal, under the current White House and Congress, are far worse than most of us could have imagined.
Obama	0	Americans may have grown accustomed to big money and special interests exerting too much influence in Washington, but even they have been shocked by what appears to be a systematic takeover of our democracy by high-priced lobbyists.
Obama	0	Think about it.
Obama	0	In the past several months, we've seen politicians resigning for taking millions of dollars in bribes.
Obama	0	We've seen the head of the White House procurement office arrested.
Obama	0	We've seen some of our most powerful leaders of both the House and the Senate under federal investigation.
Obama	0	We've seen the number of registered lobbyists in Washington double since George Bush came into office.
Obama	0	And of course, we've seen the indictment of Jack Abramoff.
Obama	0	Over the past few days, there have been suggestions by Republican operatives and commentators that this is somehow a bipartisan scandal.
Obama	0	But let's be clear - while the Democrats certainly are not without sin when it comes to money in politics, Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon and the K Street project - these are Republican sins, and Republican sins alone.
Obama	0	What is also true is that the offenses involved go beyond Jack Abramoff.
Obama	0	They are bigger than golf junkets to Scotland and lavish gifts for lawmakers.
Obama	0	The recent scandals have shaken the very foundation of the American people's faith in a government that will look out for their interests and uphold their values.
Obama	0	Because they don't just lead to morally offensive conduct on the part of politicians.
Obama	0	They lead to morally offensive legislation that hurts hardworking Americans.
Obama	0	When big oil companies are invited into the White House for secret energy meetings, it's no wonder they end up with billions in tax breaks while Americans still struggle to fill up their gas tanks and heat their homes.
Obama	0	When the halls of Congress are filled with high-priced lobbyists from the pharmaceutical industry - some who used to be members of Congress - it's hardly a surprise that they get taxpayer-funded giveaways in the same Medicare bill that forbids seniors from banding together to negotiate for better drug prices.
Obama	0	When the people running Washington are accountable only to the special interests that fund their campaigns, of course they'll spend your tax dollars with reckless abandon; of course they'll load up bills with pet projects and driving us into deficit with the hope that no one will notice.
Obama	0	At this point, the well-connected CEOs and hired guns on K Street who've helped write our laws have gotten what they paid for.
Obama	0	They got all the tax breaks and loopholes and access they could ever want.
Obama	0	But outside this city, the people who can't afford the high-priced lobbyists and don't want to break the law are wondering, "When is it our turn?
Obama	0	When will someone in Washington stand up for me?"
Obama	0	We're here today to answer that call because let's face it - for the last few years, the people running Washington simply haven't.
Obama	0	And while only some are to blame for the corruption that has plagued this city, all are responsible for fixing it.
Obama	0	That's why we're asking Republicans to put an end to the pay-to-play schemes and join us in passing the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which should go a long way toward correcting some of the most egregious offenses of the last few years.
Obama	0	You've already heard some of the key provisions in our proposal.
Obama	0	It will prevent former Members of Congress from lobbying for legislation they were voting on just a year ago, it will provide more transparency to allow the public to see exactly what their representatives are doing in Washington, and it will end the gifts and trips that allowed people like Jack Abramoff to influence politicians.
Obama	0	I realize that our friends on the other side of the aisle have suddenly found religion on this topic, and I think that's commendable.
Obama	0	In fact, I look forward to working in a bipartisan fashion to get a solid bill passed.
Obama	0	But let me close by saying that it's going to take much more than gift bans and lobbying reform to restore the public's faith in a government of, by, and for the American people.
Obama	0	To earn back that trust - to show people that we're working for them and looking out for their interests - we have to start acting like it.
Obama	0	That means instead of meeting with lobbyists, it's time to start meeting with some of the 45 million Americans with no health care.
Obama	0	Instead of hitting up the big firms on K Street, it's time to start visiting the workers on Main Street who are wondering how they'll send their kids to college or whether their pension will be around when they retire.
Obama	0	All these people have done to earn access and gain influence is cast their ballot, but in this democracy, it's all anyone should have to do.
Obama	0	The people running this town need to realize that, and if we hope to be real reformers, that's the place we need to start.
Obama	0	January 2006 Middle East Trip - Podcast Transcript  TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense January 14, 2006 From the Road: Israel and the Palestinian territories At the end of his Middle East trip Via Cell Phone from Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv Complete Transcript NOTE: The transcript abruptly ends – there is no goodbye – because Senator Obama’s cell phone connection dropped — Hello, this is Barack Obama and it's the 14th of January.
Obama	0	I'm sitting in an airport in Tel Aviv finishing up on a 9-day trip to the Middle East.
Obama	0	Those of you who listened to the last Podcast know that I spent several days in Baghdad as well as Qatar, Kuwait and Jordan.
Obama	0	For the last 5 days I've traveled throughout Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Obama	0	My impressions - and for those of you who have been to the Middle East I think you'll recognize - that it's an extraordinarily complex place.
Obama	0	We had the opportunity on the first day to meet with a variety of members of Israel security forces and get briefings from them about the border situation and their concerns surrounding Iran as well as the prospects of elections both on the Palestinian side and the Israeli side.
Obama	0	This was a difficult time for the Israeli people - Prime Minister Sharon had just suffered a massive stroke and there was a lot of tumult in terms of political positioning.
Obama	0	Fortunately at least on the Israeli side there seems to be a growing consensus represented by the Kadima party, that a centrist position that seeks to disengage from certain areas that are currently controlled by Israel while maintaining vigilance against terrorist attacks is the right approach.
Obama	0	I also had the opportunity then to fly from Tel Aviv all the way up north on a Blackhawk helicopter and see the borders of Israel and the separation barrier that has been erected.
Obama	0	The separation barrier is a major bone of contention between Palestinians and Israelis at this point.
Obama	0	In most portions it's a high fence that appears temporary and could be moved if the peace process and negotiations go forward.
Obama	0	In some places it is a wall - a high barrier that can't be breeched and certainly looks permanent.
Obama	0	One of the points that I think all Israelis want to emphasize is how small and potentially vulnerable from the ground Israel is.
Obama	0	And it's true that at certain points it's only about 20-30 minutes wide.
Obama	0	When you are flying over it is almost impossible to distinguish between - at least for a layman - between Palestinian villages and Israeli villages.
Obama	0	And we had the opportunity to fly up over the Sea of Galilee, towards the Israeli, Lebanese and Syrian borders and visit with a gentleman whose house had been hit by a Katyusha missile just recently, launched by Hezbollah (Hezbollah, the militant Islamic organization that is active in Syria and Lebanon and occasionally engages in skirmishes across the border and obviously makes the population there feel extraordinarily vulnerable.)
Obama	0	But, having said that, one of the things you do get a strong sense of is that Israel at this point possesses such superior military forces, that they don't really have enormous vulnerability in a conventional sense.
Obama	0	There is no risk of invasion by its neighbors and Israel's economy and infrastructure seem extraordinarily robust and vibrant.
Obama	0	The following day I went into Ramallah and to the West Bank and had an opportunity to talk to Palestinian students, as well as Palestinian businessmen and also had a meeting with Abu Mazen, the President and successor to Yasser Arafat.
Obama	0	As you travel through the West Bank, you get a sense of the differences between life for Palestinians and Israelis in this region.
Obama	0	Palestinians have to suffer through the checkpoint system, the barriers, the fenced-in wall that exists just to get to their jobs, often times to travel from north and south even within the west bank.
Obama	0	It's created enormous hardship for them - there is high unemployment and the economy is not doing as well as it should.
Obama	0	Unfortunately the Palestinians, through Yasser Arafat, suffered from leadership that seemed to be more interested in the rhetoric of Israel's destruction and less interested in actually constructively creating a peaceful solution to the problem and focusing on delivery of services to the Palestinian people.
Obama	0	And so I had a wonderful discussion with Palestinian students as well as discussions with Palestinian businessmen and Abu Mazen, about the importance of the Palestinian people focusing on building up infrastructure, building up capacity, building up an honest, non-corrupt government, consolidating arms that are currently dispersed among a variety of militias under a single command structure of the Palestinian authority, and entering into constructive negotiations on a non-violent basis to arrive at a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian problem.
Obama	0	Whether that's going to be able to happen or not is not yet clear.
Obama	0	There are elections on January 26th and Abu Mazen - his party, Fatah party - is being challenged very effectively by Hammas, which has historically been a terrorist organization.
Obama	0	This is their first venture into politics and they've proved to be much more adept at politics and organization than the ruling Fatah movement, which has been marked for its reputation of corruption.
Obama	0	The next day, and the final full day in Israel, we spent finally doing a little bit of sight-seeing and traveling through the old city of Jerusalem.
Obama	0	Those of you who have been here know the incredible magic of the city.
Obama	0	As the sun rises over 2,000-year old walls - walls built by David, Soloman, the Turkish Empire, we visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where the site of Calvary and Jesus' tomb is located.
Obama	0	Just a stone's throw away, the Western Wall; across from there you have the magnificent Dome of the Rock, gilded in gold.
Obama	0	It gives you a sense of just how much history is here and it reminds us that you have to be humble when you think about the Middle East and what's possible here.
Obama	0	There are a lot of memories, there's a lot of history, there are a lot of grudges and bitterness and in some ways it reminds us of how lucky we are as Americans that ironically we don't have this kind of history.
Obama	0	It's easier for us to forget and move on.
Obama	0	It's much harder for people here who are seeing everyday the roots of their own people and the conflicts that go back generation after generation.
Obama	0	On the other hand, as I was leaving Jerusalem on that final day and looking over the Old City I was reminded of how similar in many ways Palestinians and Jews, Muslims, Christians - how similar all these people were; and that despite differences in language and religion and despite the bitter history of the region it must be possible on some level to have each group recognize the humanity of the other.
Obama	0	January 2006 Trip to Iraq and Kuwait - Podcast Transcript  TOPIC: Iraq January 9, 2006 From the Road: Speaking with American Troops in Iraq Complete Text PODCAST TRANSCRIPT: Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama, and I am resuming my podcasts after a couple weeks Christmas Break.
Obama	0	And I am calling from a cell phone at a hotel overlooking the hills of Amman, Jordan.
Obama	0	It's actually a beautiful city, Jordan.
Obama	0	The sun is setting and I am just come back from my first trip into Iraq.
Obama	0	You know, obviously Iraq has dominated our foreign policy for the last several years.
Obama	0	Listeners to my regular podcasts or those who followed my campaign, I think, are aware of the fact that I have been deeply skeptical about the administration's policy towards Iraq and the initial invasion.
Obama	0	I felt it was important for me to visit Iraq myself and get some sort of first hand report about what was happening there.
Obama	0	So, I started the trip actually from Kuwait, where the US maintains several bases that are used to provide logistical support for what's happening in Iraq.
Obama	0	I met with troops as well as some of the generals who are in charge of logistical support.
Obama	0	They talked about the enormous efforts that are required to maintain our presence in Iraq.
Obama	0	There are about 20,000 troops in this base in Kuwait and they typically provide initial training for troops before they deploy into Iraq as well as providing water and fuel and are used as a launching site for operations in Iraq.
Obama	0	I had the opportunity to meet with a number of troops from Illinois as well as play a little basketball with some of the troops in the gymnasium there.
Obama	0	And so I had a chance to talk to them about their feelings about what was happening.
Obama	0	I think it's fair to say that morale among almost every US troop that I met was high.
Obama	0	I think everybody is very proud of the work that they're doing and understandably so.
Obama	0	Because regardless of how you feel about the war, what's astonishing is just the pride that our men and women in uniform take about accomplishing the tasks before them.
Obama	0	The effort in Iraq is just an unbelievable logistical task.
Obama	0	We flew into Baghdad and then I was helicoptered into the Green Zone.
Obama	0	And when you visit the Green Zone, which is several miles wide and long in the center of Baghdad, you really get a sense that US military operations have built an entire city within a city.
Obama	0	There are thousands of US military personnel and coalition forces - everything from embassy personnel to logistical support to troops that are about to be deployed into other areas of the country.
Obama	0	It's an impressive achievement and in conversations with US personnel there all of them felt a genuine sense of progress after this most recent election.
Obama	0	The feeling was that there was a great opportunity for the first time in sometime to create a national unity government that actually had some claim of legitimacy with the Iraqi people.
Obama	0	I had a meeting then with Ambassador Khalilzad, the US Ambassador to Iraq, who discussed the meaning of the most recent election.
Obama	0	His belief is that there is an opportunity to create a government that unifies Shiite, Sunni and Kurd, but that it's not going to be easy.
Obama	0	That the election in and of itself doesn't create that unity.
Obama	0	In fact the election was largely along sectarian lines.
Obama	0	But that hopefully there is a recognition on the part of the leadership in all these various factions that recognizes a unified Iraq is better than the alternative, regardless of how difficult it is.
Obama	0	And overall I was impressed with the work that he was doing.
Obama	0	Later that evening I had dinner with the President or Iraq, President Talabani as well as a number of ministers in the current Iraqi government, representing various factions.
Obama	0	And the general impression was that they recognized the need to arrive at accommodations; and that was a cause for some small optimism.
Obama	0	The next day we took Blackhawk helicopters and went out to Fallujah, which is the site of some of the worst violence in Iraq.
Obama	0	I did not travel through the city proper but rather flew into the primary US military base out there, and had a briefing from both their general as well as the colonels who were in charge of troops out there.
Obama	0	As we arrived we learned that just a day earlier five marines had been killed, and obviously people were pretty somber about that.
Obama	0	It's still very dangerous work to be done.
Obama	0	And in discussions with our military, one message that came across repeatedly was that there is not going to be a military solution to the problem of Iraq; that only political accommodations can solve some of these problems.
Obama	0	One of the colonels that we met in Fallujah, who is in charge of intelligence, pointed out that you've got 50% unemployment rates in many of the western portions of Iraq.
Obama	0	And what that means is that the insurgency is going to continually grow unless the central government pays attention to the concrete needs of the people in that area.
Obama	0	It also means that despite the work of the US military in apprehending the leaders of the insurgency in that area, there are always young men who are willing to fill the shoes of those who are apprehended.
Obama	0	And as a consequence, the insurgency and the dangers posed by the explosive devices that they are setting throughout the country will continue, as well as the suicide bombings.
Obama	0	This colonel really felt very strongly that the problem we faced was not a matter of foreign fighters, but rather a combination of foreign Jihadists and, more importantly, the homegrown support that continues to be generated.
Obama	0	We went to Kirkuk in northern Iraq where the situation is a little bit more stable, although there is significant tension there.
Obama	0	Kirkuk is the site of a lot of oil wealth that the Kurdish want to incorporate into their regional government and is being resisted by Shiite and Sunni alike.
Obama	0	And so a very complicated political process is taking place in that region.
Obama	0	You know, as you fly from Baghdad airport to the Green Zone and then out to places like Fallujah and you look down on the countryside and over the city, you realize how devastating this war has been for the country.
Obama	0	It still looks shell-shocked.
Obama	0	The land is muddy and fallow and strewn with skeletons of old trucks and cars and the imprints of buildings that are now reduced to rubble.
Obama	0	There is very little traffic on the streets; a few people are on foot.
Obama	0	It reminds you of how devastating war is.
Obama	0	The conversations that I had with troops who had lost friends and colleagues reminded me of how personally devastating war is to soldiers and their families.
Obama	0	And I think generally it emphasizes, in my mind at least, how our foreign policy has to be tough but it has to also be smart; and that we have to possess some element of humility about our capacity to remake other countries and other cultures.
Obama	0	I think there are several things that I at least learned from the trip, some of which reinforced some of my previous thoughts and some thoughts that are new: Number one, we have probably a six-month window in which to create the sort of national unity government that can actually deliver a basic government to the Iraqi people and deliver the sort of political accommodations that are the necessary precursor for any solution to the violence in Iraq.
Obama	0	Whether that's going to happen or not will depend on the degree to which the Shiite majority shows restraint and recognizes the need to bring Sunnis into all levels of government, particularly the security forces.
Obama	0	It's also going to depend on the degree that the Sunnis are willing to recognize that they are never going to have the same degree of power given their numbers as they did under Saddam Hussein.
Obama	0	The second thing that's going to need to happen if there is going to be any modicum of success in Iraq is that the security forces themselves have to be representative of all portions of Iraqi society.
Obama	0	Right now the security forces are dominated by Shiite.
Obama	0	There have been some disturbing reports about the Ministry of the Interior and the police being used as a vendetta force against Sunnis.
Obama	0	That obviously helps to fan the insurgency, which raises a broader point.
Obama	0	And that is that it's going to be important for whatever government that is elected to actually start building institutional capacity.
Obama	0	We met with some of the officials that are in charge of reconstruction over there; and it's clear that the basic structure of civil service - a non-corrupt, technocratic approach to solving problems and delivering services is not deeply imbedded there and has to be developed.
Obama	0	And changing that culture is going to take time but it's going to have to start.
Obama	0	And whatever else the national unity government accomplishes it's got to recognize that it needs a basic structure of service delivery to gain the confidence of the Iraqi people.
Obama	0	Finally, and I think most importantly, what's clear is that there is not going to be a military solution to this problem.
Obama	0	I heard this repeatedly, not just from civilians or observers, but from the military - our military - the recognition that the insurgency cannot be defeated by armed might alone.
Obama	0	And it is absolutely critical that our policies recognize that.
Obama	0	I remember having a conversation with one of the colonels out in the field, and although he did not believe that a rapid unilateral withdrawal would actually be helpful, there was no doubt that the US occupation in Iraq was becoming an increasing source of irritation.
Obama	0	And that one of the things that we're going to need to do - and to do sooner rather than later - is to transition our troops out of the day-to-day operations in Iraq and to have a much lower profile and a smaller footprint in the country over the coming year.
Obama	0	On the other hand, I did also ask some people who were not particularly sympathetic to the initial war, but were now trying to make things work in Iraq - what they thought would be the result of a total withdrawal and I think the general view was that we were in such a delicate situation right now and that there was so little institutional capacity on the part of the Iraqi government, that a full military withdrawal at this point would probably result in significant civil war and potentially hundreds of thousands of deaths.
Obama	0	This by the way was a message that was delivered also by the Foreign Minister of Jordan, who I've been meeting with while here in Amman, Jordan.
Obama	0	The sense, I think, throughout the entire region among those who opposed the US invasion, that now that we're there it's important that we don't act equally precipitously in our approach to withdrawal, but that we actually stabilize the situation and allow time for the new Iraqi government to develop some sort of capacity.
Obama	0	I guess the final point I just want to make is how proud I am of the US troops there.
Obama	0	One of the things that I continually emphasized to them was that regardless of how any of us feel about the administration's decision to go into Iraq, all of us are extraordinarily proud of the work that they're doing.
Obama	0	What the US military accomplishes on a day-to-day basis, in just setting up and rebuilding portions of the country that have been destroyed and in carrying out extraordinarily difficult tasks on a day-to-day basis is amazing.
Obama	0	And particularly when I was talking to the Illinois troops many of them are guardsmen and reservists - some of them on their second or third rotation - it was important for me to emphasize to them that the folks back home fully support them even as we have, I think, a very legitimate debate back in Washington about what we're doing there.
Obama	0	The fact is that our US military is probably the most capable institution on the planet in terms of carrying out extraordinarily difficult assignments.
Obama	0	But it's incumbent on our civilian leadership in Washington to make sure that we don't provide them with assignments that are impossible to accomplish.
Obama	0	And I continue to be concerned that we have set out for ourselves just an enormous task of rebuilding an extremely volatile and large country, and the military is not going to be able to do it alone so we're going to have to have some good policies from Washington to move it forward.
Obama	0	Anyway, I hope everybody had a wonderful holiday.
Obama	0	I will be returning to Washington after several days in Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Obama	0	It's obviously a difficult time there, given the grave illness that Ariel Sharon is suffering.
Obama	0	It's thrown the entire Middle East into tumult and I may have some more to say about that when I get back.
Obama	0	So hopefully I'll be able to deliver a podcast next week and look forward to being back home to see my wife and kids next week as well.
Obama	0	Take care everybody.
Obama	0	Bye-bye.
Obama	0	Senate Floor Statement - The PATRIOT Act  TOPIC: Homeland Security December 15, 2005 Senate Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama The PATRIOT Act Complete Text Four years ago, following the most devastating attack in our history, this body passed the USA PATRIOT Act in order to give our nation's law enforcement the tools they need to track down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over the world - terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit weaknesses in our laws and our security to carry out even deadlier attacks than we saw on September 11th.
Obama	0	We all agree that we needed legislation to make it harder for suspected terrorists to go undetected in this country.
Obama	0	And we all agree we needed to make it harder for them to organize and strategize and get flight licenses and sneak across our borders.
Obama	0	Americans everywhere wanted that.
Obama	0	But soon after the PATRIOT Act passed, a few years before I ever arrived in the Senate, I began hearing concerns from people of every background and political leaning that this law - the very purpose of which was to protect us - was also threatening to violate our rights and freedoms as Americans.
Obama	0	That it didn't just provide law enforcement the powers it needed to keep us safe, but powers it didn't need to invade our privacy without cause or suspicion.
Obama	0	In Washington, this issue has tended degenerate into an "either-or" type debate.
Obama	0	Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles.
Obama	0	But that is a false choice.
Obama	0	It asks too little of us and assumes too little about America.
Obama	0	That's why as it's come time to reauthorize this law, we've been working in a bipartisan way to do both - to show the American people that we can track down terrorists without trampling on our civil liberties.
Obama	0	To show the American people that the federal government will only issue warrants and execute searches because it needs to, not because it can.
Obama	0	What we have been trying to achieve, under the leadership of a bipartisan group of Senators, is some accountability in this process - to get answers and see evidence where there is suspicion.
Obama	0	Several weeks ago, this work bore fruit.
Obama	0	The Judiciary Committee and the U.S. Senate managed to pass a piece of bi-partisan legislation that, while I can't say is perfect, was able to address many of these most serious problems in the existing law.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, that strong bi-partisan legislation has been tossed aside in Conference.
Obama	0	Instead, we have been forced to consider a piece of rushed legislation that fails to address the concerns of members of both parties as well as the American people.
Obama	0	This is legislation that puts our own Justice Department above the law.
Obama	0	When National Security Letters are issued, they allow federal agents to conduct any search on any American, no matter how extensive or wide-ranging, without ever going before a judge to prove that the search is necessary.
Obama	0	They simply need sign-off from a local FBI official.
Obama	0	That's all.
Obama	0	Once a business or a person receives notification that they will be searched, they are prohibited from telling anyone about it, and they are even prohibited from challenging this automatic gag order in court.
Obama	0	Even though judges have already found that similar restrictions violate the First Amendment - this Conference Report disregards the case law and the right to challenge the gag order.
Obama	0	If you do decide to consult an attorney for legal advice - you have to tell the FBI that you have done so.
Obama	0	This is unheard of - there is no such requirement in any other area of law, and I don't see why it is justified here.
Obama	0	And if someone wants to know why their own government has decided to go on a fishing expedition through every personal record or private document - through library books they've read and phone calls they've made - this legislation gives people no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law.
Obama	0	No judge will hear their plea, no jury will hear their case.
Obama	0	This is just plain wrong.
Obama	0	Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activity is one thing - and it's the right thing - but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for.
Obama	0	Supporters of this Conference Report have argued that we should just hold our noses and support the legislation, because it's not going to get any better.
Obama	0	That does not convince me that I should support this report.
Obama	0	I believe we owe it to the nation to do whatever we can to make this legislation better.
Obama	0	We don't have to settle for a PATRIOT Act that sacrifices our liberties or our safety - we can have one that secures both.
Obama	0	There have been proposals on both sides of Congress, from both parties, to extend the PATRIOT Act for three months so that we can reach agreement on this bill.
Obama	0	I support those efforts and will oppose cloture on this unacceptable Conference Report.
Obama	0	Moving Forward in Iraq  TOPIC: Iraq November 22, 2005 Moving Forward in Iraq Chicago Council on Foreign Relations Complete Text It is a privilege to give this speech at the Council on Foreign Relations here in Chicago.
Obama	0	A few months ago, I had the opportunity to visit Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
Obama	0	While I was there, I met a young man whose legs had been blown off from mortar fire and who had sustained severe nerve damage in his arms and hands.
Obama	0	He was sewing as a means of regaining his small motor skills, and as his wife looked on, they talked about their efforts to piece their lives back together.
Obama	0	They talked about the wonderful way their young daughter had embraced her father and told him she loved him despite his disfigurement.
Obama	0	I also met a young man who had lost a leg and an arm and who now had a breathing tube in his throat.
Obama	0	He was working with two of the therapists in a mock-up kitchen to cook hamburgers on his own.
Obama	0	We went down to the physical therapy area where I talked to a 19-year-old former track star who had lost both his legs and was working out on one of the weight machines.
Obama	0	And I spoke to a sergeant from Iowa who had lost one of his legs but was working vigorously to get accustomed to his prosthetic leg so he could return to Iraq as soon as he could.
Obama	0	I then went up to the wards to visit with other injured veterans - to take pictures, talk about basketball, and to say thank you.
Obama	0	Listening to the stories of these young men and women, most of them in their early twenties, I had to ask myself how I would be feeling if it were my son, my nephew, or my sister lying there.
Obama	0	I asked myself how I would be feeling if it were me struggling to learn how to walk again?
Obama	0	Would I feel bitter?
Obama	0	Would I feel hopeless?
Obama	0	I don't know.
Obama	0	None of us can answer that question fully until we find ourselves in that situation.
Obama	0	What I do know is that the extraordinary men and women that I met seemed uninterested in rage or self-pity.
Obama	0	They were proud of their service.
Obama	0	They were hopeful for their future.
Obama	0	They displayed the kind of grit and optimism and resourcefulness that represents the very best of America.
Obama	0	They remind us, in case we need reminding, that there is no more profound decision that we can make than the decision to send this nation's youth to war, and that we have a moral obligation not only to send them for good reasons, but to constantly examine, based on the best information and judgment available, in what manner, and for what purpose, and for how long we keep them in harm's way.
Obama	0	Today, nearly 160,000 American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are risking their lives in the Middle East.
Obama	0	They are operating in some of the most dangerous and difficult circumstances imaginable.
Obama	0	Well over 2,000 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice - given their full measure of devotion.
Obama	0	Thousands more have returned with wounds like those that I saw at Walter Reed.
Obama	0	These men and women are willing to lay down their lives to protect us.
Obama	0	When they were told there was danger that needed to be confronted they said, "I will go.
Obama	0	I will leave my family and my friends and the life I knew and I will fight."
Obama	0	And they went.
Obama	0	And they're fighting still.
Obama	0	And so as the war rages on and the insurgency festers - as another father weeps over a flag-draped casket and another wife feeds her husband the dinner he can't fix for himself - it is our duty to ask ourselves hard questions.
Obama	0	What do we want to accomplish now that we are in Iraq, and what is possible to accomplish?
Obama	0	What kind of actions can we take to ensure not only a safe and stable Iraq, but that will also preserve our capacity to rebuild Afghanistan, isolate and apprehend terrorist cells, preserve our long-term military readiness, and devote the resources needed to shore up our homeland security?
Obama	0	What are the costs and benefits of our actions moving forward?
Obama	0	What urgency are we willing to show to bring our troops home safely?
Obama	0	What kind of answers are we willing to demand from those in charge of the war?
Obama	0	In other words -- What kind of debate are we willing to have?
Obama	0	Last week, the White House showed exactly what kind of debate it wants on future of Iraq - none.
Obama	0	We watched the shameful attempt to paint John Murtha - a Marine Corp recipient of two-purple hearts and a Bronze Star - into a coward of questionable patriotism.
Obama	0	We saw the Administration tell people of both parties - people who asked legitimate questions about the intelligence that led us to war and the Administration's plan for Iraq - that they should keep quiet, end the complaining, and stop rewriting history.
Obama	0	This political war - a war of talking points and Sunday news shows and spin - is not one I'm interested in joining.
Obama	0	It's a divisive approach that only pushes us further from what the American people actually want - a pragmatic solution to the real war we're facing in Iraq.
Obama	0	I do want to make the following observations, though.
Obama	0	First, I am part of that post Baby Boom generation that was too young to fight in Vietnam, not called to fight in Desert Storm, too old for the current conflict.
Obama	0	For those like me who - for whatever reason - have never seen battle, whether they be in the Administration or in Congress, let me suggest that they put the words "coward" and "unpatriotic" out of their vocabulary - at least when it comes to veterans like John Murtha who have put their lives on the line for this country.
Obama	0	I noticed that the President recognized this bit of wisdom yesterday.
Obama	0	I hope others do to.
Obama	0	Second - the Administration is correct to say that we have real enemies, that our battle against radical Islamist terrorism will not be altered overnight, that stability in the Middle East must be part of our strategy to defeat terrorism, that military power is a key part of our national security, that our strategy cannot be poll driven.
Obama	0	The Administration is also correct when it says that many overestimated Saddam's biological and chemical capacity, and that some of its decisions in going to war were prompted by real errors in the intelligence community's estimates.
Obama	0	However, I think what is also true is that the Administration launched the Iraq war without giving either Congress or the American people the full story.
Obama	0	This is not a partisan claim - you don't have to take my word for it.
Obama	0	All you need to do is to match up the Administration's statements during the run-up to the war with the now declassified intelligence estimates that they had in their possession at the time.
Obama	0	Match them up and you will conclude that at the very least, the Administration shaded, exaggerated and selectively used the intelligence available in order to make the case for invasion.
Obama	0	The President told the American people about Iraqi attempts to acquire yellow cake during the State of the Union.
Obama	0	The Vice-President made statements on national television expressing certainty about Iraq's nuclear weapons programs.
Obama	0	Secretary Rice used the words "mushroom cloud" over and over again.
Obama	0	We know now that even at the time these unequivocal statements were made, intelligence assessments existed that contradicted these claims.
Obama	0	Analysis from the CIA and State Department was summarily dismissed when it did not help the Administration make the case for war.
Obama	0	I say all this not to score cheap political points.
Obama	0	I say this because war is a serious business.
Obama	0	It requires enormous sacrifice, in blood and treasure, from the American people.
Obama	0	The American people have already lost confidence in the credibility of our leadership, not just on the question of Iraq, but across the board.
Obama	0	According to a recent Pew survey, 42% of Americans agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own" - a significant increase since the immediate aftermath of 9/11.
Obama	0	We risk a further increase in isolationist sentiment unless both the Administration and Congress can restore the American people's confidence that our foreign policy is driven by facts and reason, rather than hopes and ideology.
Obama	0	And we cannot afford isolationism - not only because our work with respect to stabilizing Iraq is not complete, but because our missteps in Iraq have distracted us from the larger threat of terrorism that we face, a threat that we can only meet by working internationally, in cooperation with other countries.
Obama	0	Now, given the enormous stakes in Iraq, I believe that those of us who are involved in shaping our national security policies should do what we believe is right, not merely what is politically expedient.
Obama	0	I strongly opposed this war before it began, though many disagreed with me at that time.
Obama	0	Today, as Americans grow increasingly impatient with our presence in Iraq, voices I respect are calling for a rapid withdrawal of our troops, regardless of events on the ground.
Obama	0	But I believe that, having waged a war that has unleashed daily carnage and uncertainty in Iraq, we have to manage our exit in a responsible way - with the hope of leaving a stable foundation for the future, but at the very least taking care not to plunge the country into an even deeper and, perhaps, irreparable crisis.
Obama	0	I say this not only because we owe it to the Iraqi people, but because the Administration's actions in Iraq have created a self-fulfilling prophecy - a volatile hotbed of terrorism that has already begun to spill over into countries like Jordan, and that could embroil the region, and this country, in even greater international conflict.
Obama	0	In sum, we have to focus, methodically and without partisanship, on those steps that will: one, stabilize Iraq, avoid all out civil war, and give the factions within Iraq the space they need to forge a political settlement; two, contain and ultimately extinquish the insurgency in Iraq; and three, bring our troops safely home.
Obama	0	Last week's re-politicization of the war makes this kind of focus extremely difficult.
Obama	0	In true Washington fashion, the Administration has narrowed an entire debate about war into two camps: "cut-and-run" or "stay the course."
Obama	0	If you offer any criticism or even mention that we should take a second look at our strategy and change our approach, you're branded cut-and-run.
Obama	0	If you're ready to blindly trust the Administration no matter what they do, you're willing to stay the course.
Obama	0	A variation on this is the notion that anything short of an open-ended commitment to maintain our current troop strength in Iraq is the equivalent of issuing a "timetable" that will, according to the Administration, undermine our troops and strengthen the insurgency.
Obama	0	.
Obama	0	This simplistic framework not only misstates the position of thoughtful critics on both sides of the aisle - from Republican Senator Chuck Hagel to Democrat Russ Feingold.
Obama	0	It completely misses where the American people are right now.
Obama	0	Every American wants to see a peaceful and stable Iraq.
Obama	0	No American wants to leave behind a security vacuum filled with terrorism, chaos, ethnic cleansing and genocide.
Obama	0	But no American wants a war without end - a war where our goals and strategies drift aimlessly regardless of the cost in lives or dollars spent, and where we end up with arbitrary, poll-driven troop reductions by the Administration - the worst of all possible outcomes.
Obama	0	It has been two years and seven months since the fall of Baghdad and any honest assessment would conclude that the Administration's strategy has not worked.
Obama	0	The civilian efforts to rebuild Iraq, establish a secure environment, and broker a stable political framework have, thus far, come up short.
Obama	0	The Administration owes the American people a reality-based assessment of the situation in Iraq today.
Obama	0	For the past two years, they've measured progress in the number of insurgents killed, roads built, or voters registered.
Obama	0	But these benchmarks are not true measures of fundamental security and stability in Iraq.
Obama	0	When the Administration now talks about "condition-based" withdrawal, we need to know precisely what those conditions are.
Obama	0	This is why the amendment offered by Senator Levin and the one that passed from Senator Warner are so important.
Obama	0	What the Administration and some in the press labeled as a "timetable" for withdrawal was in fact a commonsense statement that: one, 2006 should be the year that the Iraqi government decreases its dependency on the United States; two, that the various Iraqi factions must arrive at a fair political accommodation to defeat the insurgency; and three, the Administration must make available to Congress critical information on reality-based benchmarks that will help us succeed in Iraq.
Obama	0	We need to know whether the Iraqis are making the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement essential for defeating the insurgency.
Obama	0	We need to know how many Iraqi security forces and police and the level of skill they will require to permit them to take the lead in counter-insurgency operations, the defense of Iraq's territory, and maintaining law and order throughout the country.
Obama	0	We need to get accurate information regarding how many Iraqi troops are currently prepared for the transition of security responsibilities, and a realistic assessment of the U.S. resources and time it will take to make them more prepared.
Obama	0	And, we need to know the Administration's strategy to restore basic services, strengthen the capacities of ministries throughout the country, and enlist local, regional, and international actors in finding solutions to political, economic, and security problems.
Obama	0	Straight answers to critical questions - for the most part, that is what both the Levin Amendment and the Warner Amendment call for.
Obama	0	Members of both parties and the American people have now made clear that it is not enough to for the President to simply say "we know best" and "stay the course."
Obama	0	As I have said before, there are no magic bullets for a good outcome in Iraq.
Obama	0	I am not the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of State, or the Director of National Intelligence.
Obama	0	I have neither the expertise nor the inclination to micro-manage war from Washington.
Obama	0	Nevertheless, given the best information I have, and in an effort to offer constructive ideas, I would suggest several broad elements that should be included in any discussion of where we go from here.
Obama	0	I should add that some of these ideas have been put forward in greater detail by other senators and foreign policy experts - I claim no pride of authorship, but rather offer my best assessment of the steps we need to take to maximize the prospects for success.
Obama	0	First and foremost, after the December 15 elections and during the course of next year, we need to focus our attention on how reduce the U.S. military footprint in Iraq.
Obama	0	Notice that I say "reduce," and not "fully withdraw."
Obama	0	This course of action will help to focus our efforts on a more effective counter-insurgency strategy and take steam out of the insurgency.
Obama	0	On this point, I am in basic agreement with our top military commander in Iraq.
Obama	0	In testimony before Congress earlier this year, General Casey stated that a key goal of the military was to "reduce our presence in Iraq, taking away one of the elements that fuels the insurgency: that of the coalition forces as an occupying force."
Obama	0	This is not and should not be a partisan issue.
Obama	0	It is a view shared by Senator Chuck Hagel, a decorated Vietnam veteran, and someone with whom I am proud to serve on the Foreign Relations Committee.
Obama	0	I believe that U.S. forces are still a part of the solution in Iraq.
Obama	0	The strategic goals should be to allow for a limited drawdown of U.S. troops, coupled with a shift to a more effective counter-insurgency strategy that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead and intensifies our efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Obama	0	At the same time, sufficient numbers of U.S. troops should be left in place to prevent Iraq from exploding into civil war, ethnic cleansing, and a haven for terrorism.
Obama	0	We must find the right balance - offering enough security to serve as a buffer and carry out a targeted, effective counter-insurgency strategy, but not so much of a presence that we serve as an aggravation.
Obama	0	It is this balance that will be critical to finding our way forward.
Obama	0	Second, we need not a time-table, in the sense of a precise date for U.S. troop pull-outs, but a time-frame for such a phased withdrawal.
Obama	0	More specifically, we need to be very clear about key issues, such as bases and the level of troops in Iraq.
Obama	0	We need to say that there will be no bases in Iraq a decade from now and the United States armed forces cannot stand-up and support an Iraqi government in perpetuity - pushing the Iraqis to take ownership over the situation and placing pressure on various factions to reach the broad based political settlement that is so essential to defeating the insurgency.
Obama	0	I agree with Senator Warner that the message should be "we really mean business, Iraqis, get on with it."
Obama	0	Without a time-frame, this message will not be sent.
Obama	0	With the Shiites increasingly in control of the government, the U.S. is viewed as the military force that is keeping the Shiites in power, picking sides in the conflict, driving a wedge between the factions, and keeping the Sunnis out of the government.
Obama	0	Wrong as these perceptions may be, they are one of the key elements unifying the insurgency and serving as its best recruiting slogan.
Obama	0	We need to immediately recognize and address this problem.
Obama	0	On October 25, Ambassador Khailizad stated that he believes that the United States is on the right track to start significant reductions of U.S. military forces in the coming year.
Obama	0	Earlier in the year, when I pressed Ambassador Khalizad on this during his confirmation hearing to be more specific about a time-frame for withdrawal, he said that there would not be a U.S. presence in Iraq a decade from now.
Obama	0	That's at a start - but I think we need to be clearer than somewhere between one and ten years.
Obama	0	Third, we need to start thinking about what an Iraqi government will look like in the near term.
Obama	0	The post-election period will be critically important in working with the Shia and Kurdish leaders to help address Sunni concerns and to take steps to bring them into the government.
Obama	0	In testimony before Congress, Secretary Rice stated that while she believed it was possible to create a multi-ethnic, democratic Iraq under a unified national government, it was also possible that, in the near term, Iraq may look more like a loose federation and less like a tightly-knit, multi-ethnic society.
Obama	0	According to the deal struck in the writing of the Constitution, the structure of the national government may still be altered by discussion among the three major factions.
Obama	0	If it is the Administration's most realistic assessment that the Iraqi government will take the form of a loose confederation, then we need to be thinking about how we should calibrate our policies to reflect this reality.
Obama	0	We cannot, and should not, foist our own vision of democracy on the Iraqis, and then expect our troops to hold together such a vision militarily.
Obama	0	Fourth, we have to do a much better job on reconstruction in Iraq.
Obama	0	The Iraqi people wonder why the United States has been unable to restore basic services - sewage, power, infrastructure - to significant portions of Iraq.
Obama	0	This has caused a loss of faith among the Iraqi people in our efforts to rebuild that nation and help it recover from decades of brutal tyranny.
Obama	0	The Administration tells us there can not be reconstruction without security, but many Iraqis make the opposite argument.
Obama	0	They say Iraq will never be secure until there is reconstruction and citizens see that a better future awaits them.
Obama	0	The Administration also tells us that they are making progress, but can not publicize the specific successes out of security concerns.
Obama	0	If we are unable to point out the progress, how are Iraqis - especially ones we are trying to persuade to claim a bigger stake in the future of their country - ever to know that the Americans efforts are helping to make their lives better?
Obama	0	How does this approach help to quell the insurgency?
Obama	0	We need to break this cycle.
Obama	0	We have to get more Iraqis involved with the reconstruction efforts.
Obama	0	After all, it is the Iraqis who best know their country and have the greatest stake in restoring basic services.
Obama	0	We need to work with the best and brightest Iraqis, inside and outside of government to come up with a plan to get the power back on in Baghdad and help to restore the faith of the Iraqi people in our important mission in Iraq.
Obama	0	Fifth, we have to launch a major diplomatic effort to get the international community, especially key neighboring states and Arab nations, more involved in Iraq.
Obama	0	If one looks at the Balkans - our most recent attempt to rebuild war torn nations - the international community, from the European Union to NATO to the United Nations, were all deeply involved.
Obama	0	These organizations, driven largely by European countries in the region, provided legitimacy, helped with burden-sharing, and were an essential part of our exit strategy.
Obama	0	Ten years later, conditions are not perfect, but the blood-shed has been stopped, and the region is no longer destabilizing the European Continent.
Obama	0	And so a part of any strategy in Iraq must more deeply integrate Iraq's neighbors, international organizations, and regional powers around the world.
Obama	0	Finally, it is critical for this Administration, and Congress, to recognize that despite the enormous stakes the United States now has in seeing Iraq succeed, we cannot let this mission distract us from the larger front of international terrorism that remains to be addressed.
Obama	0	Already we are getting reports that the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating.
Obama	0	Our progress in improving our intelligence capabilities - particularly human intelligence - has lagged.
Obama	0	Iraq has absorbed resources that could have gone into critical homeland security measures, or in improved coordination with our global allies and partners.
Obama	0	At the outset of this war, I challenged the Administration's assertion that deposing Saddam Hussein was the central measure in our war on terrorism.
Obama	0	And although I believe we must stabilize Iraq, I continue to believe that the Administration's tendency to equate the military defeat of the Iraqi insurgency with the defeat of international terrorism is dangerously short-sighted.
Obama	0	Long the before the war in Iraq, international terrorism posed a grave security threat to the United States.
Obama	0	Well over two years after the start of the Iraq war, these threats to our way of life remain every bit as serious.
Obama	0	Some have argued that these threats have grown.
Obama	0	The Administration has to be capable of finding a solution in Iraq and strengthening our efforts to combat international terrorism.
Obama	0	In the end, Iraq is not about one person's legacy, a political campaign, or rigid adherence to an ideology.
Obama	0	What is happening in Iraq is about the security of the United States.
Obama	0	It is about our men and women in uniform.
Obama	0	It is about the future of the Middle East.
Obama	0	It is about the world in which our children will live.
Obama	0	Responsible voices from all parts of the political spectrum are coming forth to say this in increasing numbers.
Obama	0	Colin Powell had the courage to call his presentation to the United Nations on Iraq a "blot" on his distinguished record.
Obama	0	And recently John Edwards said he made a mistake in voting to go to war in Iraq, and accepted responsibility for this decision.
Obama	0	It is no coincidence that both Mr. Edwards and Mr. Powell no longer serve the government in Washington.
Obama	0	Those of us in Washington are falling behind the debate that is taking place across America on Iraq.
Obama	0	We are failing to provide leadership on this issue.
Obama	0	Iraq was a major issue in last year's election.
Obama	0	But that election is now over.
Obama	0	We need to stop the campaign.
Obama	0	The President could take the politics out of Iraq once and for all if he would simply go on television and say to the American people "Yes, we made mistakes.
Obama	0	Yes, there are things I would have done differently.
Obama	0	But now that we're here, I am willing to work with both Republicans and Democrats to find the most responsible way out."
Obama	0	Nearly four decades ago, John F. Kennedy took responsibility for the Bay of Pigs Invasion.
Obama	0	He admitted that mistakes had been made.
Obama	0	He didn't spend a good deal of time publicly blaming the previous Administration, or the other party, or his critics.
Obama	0	And through these decisive actions, he earned the respect of the American people and the world - respect that allowed his diplomacy to be trusted a few years later during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Obama	0	Americans everywhere are crying out for this kind of leadership today.
Obama	0	They want to find pragmatic solutions to the difficult and complicated situation in Iraq.
Obama	0	They want to move forward on of the greatest foreign policy challenges that this nation has faced in a generation.
Obama	0	And they want to get it right for every American son and daughter who's been willing to put their lives on the line to defend the country they love.
Obama	0	It's time for us in Washington to offer the rest of the country this leadership.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award Ceremony  TOPIC: Civil Rights November 16, 2005 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award Ceremony & commemoration of Robert F. Kennedy’s 80th birthday Complete Text Thank you.
Obama	0	It’s an honor to be here today, and I’d also like to congratulate Stephen Bradbury on his award and on all the wonderful work he’s been doing on behalf of the people of New Orleans.
Obama	0	I come to this with tremendous humility.
Obama	0	I was only seven when Bobby Kennedy died.
Obama	0	Many of the people in this room knew him as brother, as husband, as father, as friend.
Obama	0	I knew him only as an icon.
Obama	0	In that sense, it is a distance I share with most of the people who now work in this Capitol – many of whom were not even born when Bobby Kennedy died.
Obama	0	But what’s interesting is that if you go throughout the offices in the Capitol, everywhere you’ll find photographs of Kennedy, or collections of his speeches, or some other memento of his life.
Obama	0	Why is this?
Obama	0	Why is it that this man who was never President, who was our Attorney General for only three years, who was New York’s junior Senator for just three and a half, still calls to us today?
Obama	0	Still inspires our debate with his words, animates our politics with his ideas, and calls us to make gentle the life of a world that’s too often coarse and unforgiving?
Obama	0	Obviously, much has to do with charisma and eloquence – that unique ability, rare for most but common among Kennedys, to sum up the hopes and dreams of the most diverse nation on Earth with a simple phrase or sentence; to inspire even the most apathetic observers of American life.
Obama	0	Part of it is his youth – both the time of life and the state of mind that dared us to hope that even after John was killed; even after we lost King; there would come a younger, energetic Kennedy who could make us believe again.
Obama	0	But beyond these qualities, there’s something more.
Obama	0	Within the confines of these walls and the boundaries of this city, it becomes very easy to play small-ball politics.
Obama	0	Somewhere between the partisan deadlock and the twenty-four hour news cycles, the contrived talking points and the focus on the sensational over the substantive, issues of war and poverty, hopelessness and lawlessness become problems to be managed, not crises to be solved.
Obama	0	They become fodder for the Sunday show scrum, not places to find genuine consensus and compromise.
Obama	0	And so, at some point, we stop reaching for the possible and resign ourselves to that which is most probable.
Obama	0	This is what happens in Washington.
Obama	0	And yet, as this goes on, somewhere another child goes hungry in a neighborhood just blocks away from one where a family is too full to eat another bite.
Obama	0	Somewhere another hurricane survivor still searches for a home to return to or a school for her daughter.
Obama	0	Somewhere another twelve-year-old is gunned down by an assailant who used to be his kindergarten playmate, and another parent loses their child on the streets of Tikrit.
Obama	0	But somewhere, there have also always been people who believe that this isn’t the way it was supposed to be – that things should be different in America.
Obama	0	People who believe that while evil and suffering will always exist, this is a country that has been fueled by small miracles and boundless dreams – a place where we’re not afraid to face down the greatest challenges in pursuit of the greater good; a place where, against all odds, we overcome.
Obama	0	Bobby Kennedy was one of these people.
Obama	0	In a nation torn by war and divided against itself, he was able to look us in the eye and tell us that no matter how many cities burned with violence, no matter how persistent the poverty or the racism, no matter how far adrift America strayed, hope would come again.
Obama	0	It was an idealism not based in rigid ideology.
Obama	0	Yes, he believed that government is a force for good – but not the only force.
Obama	0	He distrusted big bureaucracies, and knew that change erupts from the will of free people in a free society; that it comes not only from new programs, but new attitudes as well.
Obama	0	And Kennedy’s was not a pie-in-the-sky-type idealism either.
Obama	0	He believed we would always face real enemies, and that there was no quick or perfect fix to the turmoil of the 1960s.
Obama	0	Rather, the idealism of Robert Kennedy – the unfinished legacy that calls us still – is a fundamental belief in the continued perfection of American ideals.
Obama	0	It’s a belief that says if this nation was truly founded on the principles of freedom and equality, it could not sit idly by while millions were shackled because of the color of their skin.
Obama	0	That if we are to shine as a beacon of hope to the rest of the world, we must be respected not just for the might of our military, but for the reach of our ideals.
Obama	0	That if this is a land where destiny is not determined by birth or circumstance, we have a duty to ensure that the child of a millionaire and the child of a welfare mom have the same chance in life.
Obama	0	That if out of many, we are truly one, then we must not limit ourselves to the pursuit of selfish gain, but that which will help all Americans rise together.
Obama	0	We have not always lived up to these ideals and we may fail again in the future, but this legacy calls on us to try.
Obama	0	And the reason it does – the reason we still hear the echo of not only Bobby’s words, but John’s and King’s and Roosevelt’s and Lincoln’s before him – is because they stand in such stark contrast to the place in which we find ourselves today.
Obama	0	It’s the timidity of politics that’s holding us back right now – the politics of can’t-do and oh-well.
Obama	0	An energy crisis that jeopardizes our security and our economy?
Obama	0	No magic wand to fix it, we’re told.
Obama	0	Thousands of jobs vanishing overseas?
Obama	0	It’s actually healthier for the economy that way.
Obama	0	Three days late to the worst natural disaster in American history?
Obama	0	Brownie, you’re doing a heck of a job.
Obama	0	And of course, if nothing can be done to solve the problems we face, if we have no collective responsibility to look out for one another, then the next logical step is to give everyone one big refund on their government – divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand ‘em out, and encourage everyone to go buy their own health care, their own retirement plan, their own child care, their own schools, their own roads, their own levees… We know this as the Ownership Society.
Obama	0	But in our past there has been another term for it – Social Darwinism – every man or women for him or herself.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford – tough luck.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to the child who was born into poverty – pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
Obama	0	It let’s us say to the workers who lose their job when the factory shuts down – you’re on your own.
Obama	0	But there is a problem.
Obama	0	It won’t work.
Obama	0	It ignores our history.
Obama	0	Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.
Obama	0	But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we’re all in it together and everybody’s got a shot at opportunity.
Obama	0	Robert Kennedy reminded us of this.
Obama	0	He reminds us still.
Obama	0	He reminds us that we don’t need to wait for a hurricane to know that Third World living conditions in the middle of an American city make us all poorer.
Obama	0	We don’t need to wait for the 3000th death of someone else’s child in Iraq to make us realize that a war without an exit strategy puts all of our families in jeopardy.
Obama	0	We don’t have to accept the diminishment of the American Dream in this country now, or ever.
Obama	0	It’s time for us to meet the whys of today with the why nots we often quote but rarely live – to answer “why hunger” and “why homeless,” “why violence” and “why despair” with “why not good jobs and living wages,” “why not better health care and world class schools,” “why not a country where we make possible the potential that exists in every human being?” If he were here today, I think it would be hard to place Robert F. Kennedy into any of the categories that so often constrain us politically.
Obama	0	He was a fervent anti-communist but knew diplomacy was our way out of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Obama	0	He sought to wage the war on poverty but with local partnerships and community activism.
Obama	0	He was at once both hard-headed and big-hearted.
Obama	0	And yet, his was not a centrism in the sense of finding a middle road or a certain point on the ideological spectrum.
Obama	0	His was a politics that, at its heart, was deeply moral – based on the notion that in this world, there is right and there is wrong, and it’s our job to organize our laws and our lives around recognizing the difference.
Obama	0	When RFK made his famous trip to the Mississippi Delta with Charles Evers in 1967, the story is often told about the destitute they encountered as they walked from shack to shack.
Obama	0	As they walk into one with hardly a ceiling and a floor full of holes, Kennedy sees a small child with a swollen stomach sitting in the corner.
Obama	0	He tries and tries to talk to this child again and again, but he gets no response, no movement, not even a look of awareness.
Obama	0	Just a blank stare from cold, wide eyes so battered by poverty that they’re barely alive.
Obama	0	And at that point we’re told that Kennedy begins to cry.
Obama	0	And he turns to Evers and asks “How can a country like this allow it?” and Evers responds “Maybe they just don’t know.” Bobby Kennedy spent his life making sure that we knew – not only to wake us from indifference and face us with the darkness we let slip into our own backyard, but to bring us the good news that we have it within our power to change all this; to write our own destiny.
Obama	0	Because we are a people of hope.
Obama	0	Because we are Americans.
Obama	0	This is the good news we still hear all these years later – the message that still points us down the road that Bobby Kennedy never finished traveling.
Obama	0	It’s a road I hope our politics and our country begin to take in the months and years to come.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	National Women's Law Center  TOPIC: Civil Rights November 10, 2005 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama National Women's Law Center National Complete Text Thank you Duffy for that generous introduction, and I also want to thank you and Marcia and the National Women's Law Center for inviting me here.
Obama	0	As I was thinking about tonight's dinner and all the progress the women's movement has made in the last century, the first thing that came to mind wasn't all the legal cases won or the legislation passed; it wasn't the issues debated or even the individual rights secured.
Obama	0	I thought about my daughters.
Obama	0	I thought about the world that Sasha and Malia will grow up in, about the chances they'll have and the challenges they'll face.
Obama	0	And I thought about my hopes for them - that they'll be able to dream without limit, achieve without constraint, and be free to seek their own happiness.
Obama	0	At its heart, this has always been the essence of the women's movement in America - the quest to ensure that our daughters will have the same opportunities as our sons.
Obama	0	Now, I realize that one day, my girls will discover that this journey is not over - that there are doors left to be open and glass ceilings yet to be shattered.
Obama	0	But if they ever come to me and ask whether change is possible - whether it's worth trying - then the people in this room and all those who've come before will have given me an inspiring story to tell.
Obama	0	I'll tell my daughters that there was a time when no one asked a young woman what she wanted to be when she grew up because everyone already knew the answer.
Obama	0	But then women stood up and changed that answer.
Obama	0	I'll tell them there was a time when women were routinely passed over for jobs that went to less qualified men; when they'd lose their jobs for the crime of becoming pregnant; when female athletes would lose out on thousands in college scholarships - a time when all of this was sanctioned by the law.
Obama	0	But then women stood up and changed those laws.
Obama	0	I'll tell them there was a time when women could be openly harassed and demeaned and abused right in the place where they worked or went to school.
Obama	0	But then brave Americans like Anne Ladky and Nancy Kreiter stood up and women everywhere were protected.
Obama	0	And when my daughters ask me whether change is possible, I'll tell them that there was a time when a woman who graduated third in her class at one of the most prestigious law schools in the country couldn't find a single firm in America that would hire her.
Obama	0	And that with all her talent and brilliance, she had to start her career as an unpaid assistant to a legal secretary at a county attorney's office in Arizona.
Obama	0	But I'll also mention that years later, the progress made by the women's movement made it possible for Sandra Day O'Connor to leave Arizona and become the first female justice of the United States Supreme Court.
Obama	0	And today, if they want to find a female lawyer in a position of prominence, they need look no further than the one they call Mom.
Obama	0	I will tell them all of this not to understate the challenges women face in this new century - challenges to choice and about pay and violence and employment and family - but to illustrate that in all the struggles of past generations, one of the most remarkable achievements of this very American movement has been to forge a consensus around this ideal of equal opportunity - around the notion that discrimination based on gender has no place in our society or in our laws.
Obama	0	The result of this consensus is that today, if you ask any number of men, women, Democrats, Republicans, liberals or conservatives, "Do you believe that your daughters should have the same opportunities as your sons?
Obama	0	", the answer you would hear most frequently is "Of course."
Obama	0	And when you say "of course," it becomes harder to argue that women shouldn't get equal pay for an equal day's work, or that they shouldn't get the support they need to be good workers and good parents at the same time.
Obama	0	The other side knows this - they know that equal opportunity has always been a winning argument for us.
Obama	0	And that's why those who don't want to make it a reality choose to fight on other terms.
Obama	0	They make sure that in any given campaign or debate, the only woman's issue that ever comes up is not equal pay or health care or family leave, but the narrowest, most divisive issues like late-term abortion.
Obama	0	Now, the ability for a woman to make decisions about how many children to have and when - without interference from the government - is one of the most fundamental freedoms we have.
Obama	0	We all know, becoming a parent is one of the most - if not the most - important jobs there is.
Obama	0	No one should make that decision for a woman and her family but them.
Obama	0	And we must keep defending their right to make this choice in the years to come.
Obama	0	But even as we defend this right, it's important for us to acknowledge the moral dimension to the choice that's made.
Obama	0	Too often in our advocacy, we forget that.
Obama	0	And yet we know that many women who make the choice may never forget the difficulty that accompanies it.
Obama	0	I noticed that when Hillary Clinton acknowledged this in a speech earlier this year, some criticized her.
Obama	0	But she was merely recognizing an important moral reality for many.
Obama	0	I also think that whenever possible, we need frame choice within the broader context of equality and opportunity for women.
Obama	0	Because when we argue big, we win.
Obama	0	But when the entire struggle for opportunity is narrowed, it plays into the hands of those who thrive on the politics of division; who win by fueling culture wars.
Obama	0	A few weeks ago, I was in Nebraska speaking at the local chapter of Girls, Inc. As many of you know, this is an organization that, for over a century, has helped young women gain self-esteem and opportunity through programs that build job and educational skills, encourage health awareness, and send women to college on scholarships.
Obama	0	Recently, the American Girl doll company decided to help out Girls, Inc. by selling special bracelets and donating the proceeds to the organization - a gesture that seems both harmless and well-intentioned.
Obama	0	Unless, of course, you're the conservative right, in which case the most sensible response is to call for a boycott of American Girl.
Obama	0	Because apparently, even though it's an issue they don't discuss much and barely mention on their website, Girls, Inc. happens to believe in a woman's right to choose and support for girls regardless of their sexual orientation.
Obama	0	And so just like that, an organization dedicated to expanding horizons and providing new opportunity for young women is turned into a front for "abortion-on-demand."
Obama	0	This is what they do.
Obama	0	But we don't have to let them drag us into it.
Obama	0	There's too much still at stake for women on too many different issues for us to keep fighting on their terms.
Obama	0	Here at NWLC, you work on child care and education and health care and welfare and employment - and there's no reason that work should be drowned out by a cultural jihad.
Obama	0	In the coming weeks, many will be scouring the record of Judge Alito to find out exactly where he stands on choice.
Obama	0	Since he would replace a pivotal swing vote on the Court, this makes sense.
Obama	0	But Sandra Day O'Connor was an independent voice on a host of important women's issues - and her story exemplifies the equality of opportunity at the heart of the women's movement.
Obama	0	Whether Samuel Alito will put the law on the side of upholding this ideal for every American should be at the center of our inquiry into his judicial philosophy, and I know that NWLC will be leading the way on this.
Obama	0	It's time to find strength in this movement's roots of opportunity.
Obama	0	At a time where the forces of globalization are transforming the way we work and live, this means taking a new look at the way government can help create economic opportunity for all Americans.
Obama	0	In this debate, which has only just begun, it's women who have the most at stake, and women who should be the strongest voices.
Obama	0	The social contract between Americans and their government - the bargain that says if you're willing to work hard for your country then your country will make it easier for you to get ahead and raise a family - was made for a time when most women stayed home with the kids and most workers stayed with one company for their entire lives.
Obama	0	But even though this time is long past - even though the vast majority of women with children today are working, including single mothers - we still have social policies designed around the old model of the male breadwinner.
Obama	0	And so women still earn 76% of what men do.
Obama	0	They receive less in health benefits, less in pensions, less in Social Security.
Obama	0	They receive little help for the rising cost of child care.
Obama	0	They make up 71% of all Medicaid beneficiaries, and a full two-thirds of all the Americans who lost their health care this year.
Obama	0	When women go on maternity leave, America is the only country in the industrialized world to let them go unpaid.
Obama	0	When their children become sick and are sent home from school, many mothers are forced to choose between caring for their child and keeping their job.
Obama	0	In short, when it comes to making your way in a twenty-first century economy, our daughters still do not have the same opportunities as our sons.
Obama	0	The Administration's answer to this would only exacerbate the problem for women.
Obama	0	The idea here is to give everyone one big refund on their government - divvy it up into some tax breaks, hand them out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy their own health care, their own retirement plan, their own unemployment insurance, education, and so forth.
Obama	0	But for the single mom who's already making less than her male counterpart - the mom who had to go without a paycheck for three months when her daughter was born, who's now facing skyrocketing child care costs and an employer who doesn't provide health care coverage for part-time work - for this mom, getting a few hundred bucks off the next tax bill won't solve the problem, will it?
Obama	0	In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society.
Obama	0	But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism, every man and woman for him or herself.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - tough luck.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to the women who lose their jobs when they have to care for a sick child - life isn't fair.
Obama	0	It let's us say to the child born into poverty - pull yourself up by your bootstraps But there is a problem.
Obama	0	It won't work.
Obama	0	It ignores our history.
Obama	0	Our economic dominance has depended on individual initiative and belief in the free market; but it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity And so if we're serious about this opportunity, if we truly value families and don't think it's right to penalize parenting, then we need to start acting like it.
Obama	0	We need to update the social contract in this country to include the realities faced by working women.
Obama	0	When a parent takes parental leave, we shouldn't act like caring for a newborn baby is a three-month break - we should let them keep their salary.
Obama	0	When parents are working and their children need care, we should make sure that care is affordable, and we should make sure our kids can go to school earlier and longer so they have a safe place to learn while their parents are at work.
Obama	0	When a mom or a dad has to leave work to care for a sick child, we should make sure it doesn't result in a pink slip.
Obama	0	When a woman does lose a job, she should get unemployment insurance even if the job loss was due to a family emergency and even if she's looking for a part-time job.
Obama	0	And in an economy where health and pension coverage are shrinking, where people switch jobs multiple times and women don't always depend on their husbands for benefits, we should have portable health care plans and pensions that any individual can take with them to any part-time or full-time job and Medicaid that's there when you need it.
Obama	0	These are ideas that you've all been fighting for here at NWLC; ideas that go beyond the culture wars we're used to and should be able to get support on both sides of the aisle.
Obama	0	Ideas that - at their core - are about expanding opportunity for our daughters.
Obama	0	The other day, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.
Obama	0	At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
Obama	0	The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding.
Obama	0	Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story.
Obama	0	And she began to cry.
Obama	0	When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing.
Obama	0	I did not need sewing either.
Obama	0	I knew how to sew.
Obama	0	My mother is a seamstress in a factory.
Obama	0	I'm trying to go to college.
Obama	0	I don't need to sew to go to college.
Obama	0	My mother sews.
Obama	0	I hoped for something else."
Obama	0	I hoped for something else From the first moment a woman dared to speak that hope - dared to believe that the American Dream was meant for her too - ordinary women have taken on extraordinary odds to give their daughters the chance for something else; for a life more equal, more free, and filled with more opportunity than they ever had.
Obama	0	In so many ways we have succeeded, but in so many areas we have much work left to do.
Obama	0	The National Women's Law Center has been at the forefront of this journey, and I look forward to working with you as you continue to spread hope and expand opportunity for young women in the years to come.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	“Sex on TV 4" Report  TOPIC: Domestic Policy November 9, 2005 Remarks of U.S.
Obama	0	Senator Barack Obama "Sex on TV 4" Report Kaiser Family Foundation Washington, DC Complete Text I want to start by thanking the Kaiser foundation for the work you've done not only on today's report, but on making these issues of media and family a part of the national conversation.
Obama	0	This is a subject many of us come to not as politicians or policy makers, as but as parents most of all.
Obama	0	Because it's one thing to discuss sex and violence on television within the larger context of the culture wars - as a values debate between First Amendment crusaders and those who believe government should decide what we can and cannot watch - but it's a another thing altogether to be faced with these issues while you're sitting in front of the TV with your child.
Obama	0	I watch with my daughters, Sasha and Malia, and I can tell you that when we're in the middle of a family program and a commercial for Cialis comes on, it's more than troubling to find yourself wondering how you'll explain certain medical conditions that last longer than three hours to a four-year-old and a seven-year-old.
Obama	0	From the time they're young, we try to instill in our children a sense of what's right and wrong; a sense of what's important, of what's worth striving for.
Obama	0	As best we can, we also try to shield them from the harsher elements of life, and introduce them to the realities of adulthood at the appropriate age.
Obama	0	But the concern shared by so many parents today - a concern that frankly hasn't been taken seriously enough by some on the left - is that raising your children this way has become exceedingly difficult in a mass media culture that saturates our airwaves with a steady stream of sex, violence, and materialism.
Obama	0	Revolutions in information and technology over the last few decades have caused this stream to grow exponentially, as we're bombarded at every turn with sounds and images from DVDs, iPods, video games, and websites that we can't always control.
Obama	0	At the center of it all sits the television, which still consumes the vast majority of our media use - even more so for our children.
Obama	0	And as we're spending more free time immersed in this media culture, the amount of questionable content spilling across our screens is growing by the year.
Obama	0	Still, it's important for us to realize that the real problem we're facing is not simply one of quantity, or even the existence of sex and violence in the media per se.
Obama	0	After all, the adult content in Schindler's List is far different from the type on Desperate Housewives, and the violence in Saving Private Ryan is not the same as the kind our kids try to imitate in some of the most popular video games.
Obama	0	Rather, as your study today demonstrates, the larger concern here is one of message; it's what the media is teaching our kids about what is ok and what is not; about how to treat others and how to treat themselves.
Obama	0	It's a concern that mass media is contributing to an overall coarsening of our culture.
Obama	0	That with all the time our children are spending in front of the television, with all the choices they have to see whatever they want whenever they want, the content of their viewing is not enriching their minds, but numbing them; not broadening intellectual curiosity or appreciation for the arts, but trivializing the important and desensitizing us to the tragic.
Obama	0	It may seem to some that the effect on our children has been overstated.
Obama	0	But the studies coming in from the NIH and others show that the connection is real.
Obama	0	When children are exposed to sex without consequences, they're more likely to have it.
Obama	0	When they are shown the risks and responsibilities that go along with sex, at least one major subgroup - African-American youth - are more likely to abstain.
Obama	0	Mindless violence and macho aggression on television begets the same behavior in our kids.
Obama	0	And when eighty percent of African-American teens in a city like Washington think that they'll be rich and over half think they'll be famous, it hurts to hear them say that the path to success lies with the hoop dreams and rap careers glorified on television.
Obama	0	We don't teach our children that healthy relationships involve drunken, naked parties in a hot tub with strangers - but that's what they see when they turn on The Real World.
Obama	0	We don't teach them to express their anger by seeing how much blood they can draw with a round of ammo - but that's what they learn in the most popular video games.
Obama	0	And we don't teach our kids that the height of success is inheriting a family fortune to buy Gucci bags without ever working a serious day in your life - but that's how Paris Hilton gets by on The Simple Life.
Obama	0	You can say that kids know this isn't real, but when they're fed a steady diet of these depictions over and over again from the time they're very young, this behavior becomes acceptable - even normal.
Obama	0	So what do we do about this?
Obama	0	What do we do when bad television becomes the enemy of good parenting?
Obama	0	We start by turning off the TV altogether.
Obama	0	Our children now spend an average of three hours a day in front of the television - for African-American children, it's four hours.
Obama	0	Two out of every three households have the TV on during meals.
Obama	0	This is too much - period.
Obama	0	And so I think it would help if parents start setting down stricter rules on how much TV their kids watch and limit their hours.
Obama	0	I know this is difficult.
Obama	0	At the end of a long day, when Michelle and I are tired, it's easy to just sit the kids in front of the television and relax.
Obama	0	But I think that as parents, we have an obligation to our children to turn off the TV, pick up a book, and read to them more often.
Obama	0	Beyond that, when our kids do watch television, we should be watching it with them - this means finding programming that everyone can watch as a family and being there to answer any questions it may raise with our kids.
Obama	0	Now, at a time when both parents are more likely to work longer hours outside the home, this is a lot easier said than done.
Obama	0	We try to compete with these media messages, but it's nearly impossible to be there every moment our kids are watching television.
Obama	0	And so there's a broader responsibility here.
Obama	0	We know that with the pervasiveness of mass media today - the existence of so many means of communication that are so easily accessible all over the world - it's very difficult to regulate our way out of this problem.
Obama	0	And for those of us who value our First Amendment freedoms - who value artistic expression - we wouldn't want to.
Obama	0	But that doesn't mean we have to accept this coarsening of our culture.
Obama	0	Decades ago, when television was still in its infancy, we provided broadcasters free use of the public airwaves, which they were to operate as trustees for the public.
Obama	0	And just last week, the Senate voted to set a final date for the transition to digital television.
Obama	0	Today, we need to make it clear that the free use of the public airwaves continues to come with certain specific obligations.
Obama	0	But we also need to make it clear that for both broadcasters and their competitors there are larger civic obligations to the American public.
Obama	0	Obligations to reflect not the basest elements of American culture, but the profound and the proud.
Obama	0	Obligations to seek not just the quick buck or the bottom line, but healthy discussion and debate in the public square of the information age.
Obama	0	Obligations to our children; to our families.
Obama	0	Today, we have far more choice in what we watch than we could have ever imagined - more channels and more programming.
Obama	0	As we move further into the digital age, the transformation of entertainment will be even more dramatic than the one from stage to screen.
Obama	0	And yet, with all these new choices for consumers, there has been remarkably little done to give parents the tools and the information necessary to make their own informed choices about what their children are watching.
Obama	0	This is what the industry must do today.
Obama	0	As we move towards a digital environment, there is a golden opportunity for them to do it on their own - to use the latest in technology to give parents more information and more choice.
Obama	0	For example, this technology could make it possible for parents to create their own family tier just by programming their television to block certain channels, block certain genres of programming like dramas, or block television at certain times of the day.
Obama	0	There's no reason the industry can't make it as easy to find family-friendly television as it is to program TiVo.
Obama	0	But if the industry fails to act - if it fails to give parents advanced controls and new choices - Congress will.
Obama	0	I know that Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye are putting pressure on both broadcasters and cable companies to do a better job fighting indecency, and I'm fully behind their efforts to get the industry to change.
Obama	0	I also applaud their announcement that they will be convening a summit on these issues with the goal of achieving immediate, meaningful reforms.
Obama	0	But I'd like to outline some additional reforms that I think can make a difference for parents today.
Obama	0	First, parents should be able to get better information right away - by improving the voluntary rating system we currently have.
Obama	0	Right now, our television ratings involve nothing more than a tiny box containing some letters and numbers that flashes in the upper left-hand corner of the screen for a few seconds at the beginning of each program.
Obama	0	It's hard to understand and easy to miss.
Obama	0	Broadcasters must improve this system to include a full-screen, detailed rating that gives parents a more precise understanding of exactly what content will be shown in the program.
Obama	0	They must also ensure that promos for horror movies and ads for the show Las Vegas aren't being shown in the middle of a cartoon or a family sitcom with a more restrictive rating.
Obama	0	Beyond simply blocking out negative messages, however, we also know from Kaiser's studies that television has the power to promote positive messages that can influence behavior and raise awareness.
Obama	0	Public service announcements have actually led to reductions in teen pregnancy, and we should all be proud of the media initiative undertaken by the Kaiser Foundation with Viacom, BET, UPN and other networks to eradicate ignorance about HIV and AIDS.
Obama	0	There has been a long debate about what obligations broadcasters will have to the public in this new digital age.
Obama	0	The FCC took a first step in defining these obligations by requiring that broadcasters air children's educational programming on all their digital streams.
Obama	0	As they continue this process, the FCC must make sure they spell out these obligations before the transition to digital programming is complete.
Obama	0	When they do this, they need to make sure that broadcasters have a concrete obligation to provide public service announcements at times when people can actually see them, as well as better coverage of elections.
Obama	0	They should donate the public service time to a third-party like the Ad Council that works with reputable non-profits.
Obama	0	If they do not do this, Congress should.
Obama	0	In addition, we should also fight to prevent any attempt to gut funding or support for the Public Broadcasting System - positive television with educational messages that generations of children have been raised on.
Obama	0	Finally, there's current legislation out there that would promote further studies - like this one - which would study the effects of media on the health and development of our children.
Obama	0	This will provide parents with even more information, it's got bipartisan support in Congress, and I think it's a good idea to pursue.
Obama	0	In Newton Minow's famous "Vast Wasteland" speech to the National Association of Television Broadcasters, he told them that, "It is not enough to cater to the nation's whims - you must also serve the nation's needs."
Obama	0	Four decades later, we find ourselves immersed in a mass media culture that is at once more vast and more wasteful than ever before.
Obama	0	And so once again, we find ourselves asking those in charge to serve the needs of a nation that has a higher calling than simply peddling indecency and materialism for profit.
Obama	0	We don't have to accept what we see today as inevitable.
Obama	0	We can all work together to make media a place where big ideas and great debates are communicated.
Obama	0	We owe this much to ourselves, and we certainly owe it to our children.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Non-Proliferation and Russia  TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense November 1, 2005 Non-Proliferation and Russia: The Challenges Ahead Council on Foreign Relations Washington, DC Complete Text Good morning.
Obama	0	As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.
Obama	0	Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
Obama	0	We were in Ukraine, visiting a pathogen laboratory in Kiev.
Obama	0	This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program.
Obama	0	We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
Obama	0	Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator.
Obama	0	Inside, staring right at us, were rows upon rows of test tubes.
Obama	0	She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying.
Obama	0	Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax.
Obama	0	Others, the plague.
Obama	0	At this point I turned around and said "Hey, where's Lugar?
Obama	0	Doesn't he want to see this?"
Obama	0	I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room.
Obama	0	He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Obama	0	Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
Obama	0	But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.
Obama	0	Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs.
Obama	0	And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
Obama	0	We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
Obama	0	Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.
Obama	0	Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.
Obama	0	And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
Obama	0	Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.
Obama	0	And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?
Obama	0	With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
Obama	0	The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.
Obama	0	Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.
Obama	0	For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion.
Obama	0	First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States.
Obama	0	The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.
Obama	0	Yet, a serious threat still remains.
Obama	0	Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon.
Obama	0	For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.
Obama	0	Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.
Obama	0	In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
Obama	0	In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.
Obama	0	I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs.
Obama	0	Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.
Obama	0	At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few.
Obama	0	As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Obama	0	Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.
Obama	0	While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
Obama	0	Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S. Senate.
Obama	0	Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.
Obama	0	This was two letters.
Obama	0	Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front.
Obama	0	For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union.
Obama	0	And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
Obama	0	But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.
Obama	0	We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.
Obama	0	One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.
Obama	0	Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.
Obama	0	As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats.
Obama	0	My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
Obama	0	On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.
Obama	0	In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled.
Obama	0	While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.
Obama	0	But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.
Obama	0	By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference.
Obama	0	One final point.
Obama	0	For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.
Obama	0	Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.
Obama	0	Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces.
Obama	0	Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
Obama	0	But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
Obama	0	We must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise.
Obama	0	.
Obama	0	One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.
Obama	0	This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security.
Obama	0	Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.
Obama	0	Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.
Obama	0	I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly.
Obama	0	But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
Obama	0	It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs.
Obama	0	And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites.
Obama	0	It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
Obama	0	But lately we haven't seen many of these visits.
Obama	0	We need to see more.
Obama	0	We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.
Obama	0	And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.
Obama	0	There is no doubt that there is a tough road ahead.
Obama	0	It will be difficult.
Obama	0	And it will be dangerous.
Obama	0	But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
Obama	0	"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
Obama	0	We all breathe the same air.
Obama	0	We all cherish our children's future.
Obama	0	And we are all mortal.''
Obama	0	Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Chicago White Sox Senate Floor Statement  TOPIC: Domestic Policy Related October 27, 2005 Statement of Sen. Barack Obama Chicago White Sox Senate Floor Statement Complete Text I rise today as a U.S.
Obama	0	Senator, as an Illinoisan, and as a proud resident of the Southside of Chicago, to congratulate the Chicago White Sox for winning the 2005 World Series.
Obama	0	As my fellow Southsiders know, it has been a long time coming.
Obama	0	Founded in 1900 as the Chicago White Stockings, this year's team reached the World Series for the first time since 1959.
Obama	0	Over a century of White Sox fans have cheered for superstars such as Luke Appling, Nellie Fox, Carlton Fisk, Luis Aparicio, Harold Baines, and of course Big Frank Thomas.
Obama	0	But we haven't savored the sweet taste of a World Series championship since 1917 - until now.
Obama	0	Back then, Woodrow Wilson was President, and the Great War was raging in Europe.
Obama	0	The White Sox were a bright spot in tough times.
Obama	0	The Sox won last night the way they have won all season--by playing aggressively, scrapping for every base and every run.
Obama	0	When Juan Uribe threw to Paul Konerko for the final out, it was fitting that the ball beat the runner by only half a step.
Obama	0	The four games against the Astros were decided by a total of six runs.
Obama	0	Win by the skin of your teeth.
Obama	0	Win or die trying, that's our motto this year.
Obama	0	Jermaine Dye is the World Series MVP, and I congratulate him for that, but I'm sure he'll be the first to say that everyone on this year's team deserves a part of that award.
Obama	0	This is a team with so many great players, but no undisputed leader on the field.
Obama	0	I don't claim to be a baseball expert - or particularly unbiased on this matter - but this is one of the most selfless, balanced teams I've ever seen.
Obama	0	A team of unlikely heroes.
Obama	0	Scott Podsednik, who hadn't hit a home run all season, stepped up and hit two in the playoffs, including the walk-off winner in Game 2 on Sunday.
Obama	0	Willie Harris, who barely played in the playoffs, got a pinch hit to get on base and bring home the only run last night.
Obama	0	Geoff Blum, a former Astro, who got a pinch hit homer in the 14th inning to give us the margin of victory in Game 3.
Obama	0	And the pitching--four complete games to close out the American League Championship Series.
Obama	0	An 11 and 1 record in the playoffs.
Obama	0	15 scoreless innings to finish the World Series.
Obama	0	Before the season started, the Sox were a consensus .500 team.
Obama	0	Even as we built and maintained the best record in the American League all season, there were many doubters.
Obama	0	Towards the end of the season, we hit a rough patch, and the doubters got louder.
Obama	0	They said Cleveland had more playoff experience.
Obama	0	They said even if we held on to make the playoffs, we would get embarrassed in the first round.
Obama	0	But during the stretch run, manager Ozzie Guillen and his "kids," as he calls them, were calm and relaxed.
Obama	0	Even as Cleveland came on strong and our lead in the Central Division dwindled, Ozzie's kids continued to play pranks on each other in the clubhouse, and continued to run hard on the basepaths.
Obama	0	Once the playoffs started, there was no looking back.
Obama	0	That difficult September was gone in an instant.
Obama	0	We silenced the doubters by sweeping the World Champion Boston Red Sox.
Obama	0	We silenced the Angels during the ALCS in five games.
Obama	0	And we swept the Astros in four games.
Obama	0	I had the privilege of attending game one of the World Series on Saturday, and the fans in and around the park were a cross-section of the city.
Obama	0	There were plenty of folks old enough to remember the '59 team.
Obama	0	Almost everyone remembered the 2000 team that made the playoffs.
Obama	0	A few were even alive in 1917.
Obama	0	A staffer of mine, a Southside Irishman and a Sox fan all his life, mentioned a 92-year-old woman at Saturday's game.
Obama	0	She was jumping and cheering so much with every hit and every run that my staffer worried for her health!
Obama	0	I would like to congratulate the entire White Sox organization, in particular Jerry Reinsdorf, Kenny Williams, and Ozzie Guillen.
Obama	0	We will be celebrating this victory for a long time on the Southside, around the city of Chicago, and around the entire state of Illinois.
Obama	0	Later today, Senator Durbin and I will be introducing a resolution honoring the White Sox, and we will be asking for its immediate consideration and adoption.
Obama	0	Thank you, and I yield the floor.
Obama	0	DEATH OF ROSA PARKS SENATE FLOOR STATEMENT  TOPIC: Civil Rights October 25, 2005 Statement of Senator Obama Death of Rosa Parks - Senate Floor Statement Complete Text Mr. President, today the nation mourns a genuine American hero.
Obama	0	Rosa Parks died yesterday in her home in Detroit.
Obama	0	Through her courage and by her example, Rosa Parks helped lay the foundation for a country that could begin to live up to its creed.
Obama	0	Her life, and her brave actions, reminded each and every one of us of our personal responsibilities to stand up for what is right and the central truth of the American experience that our greatness as a nation derives from seemingly ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
Obama	0	Rosa Parks' life was a lesson in perseverance.
Obama	0	As a child, she grew up listening to the Ku Klux Klan ride by her house and lying in bed at night fearing that her house would be burnt down.
Obama	0	In her small hometown in Alabama, she attended a one-room school for African-American children that only went through the sixth grade.
Obama	0	When she moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to continue her schooling, she was forced to clean classrooms after school to pay her tuition.
Obama	0	Although she attended Alabama State Teachers College, Rosa Parks would later make her living as a seamstress and housekeeper.
Obama	0	But she didn't accept that her opportunities were limited to sewing clothes or cleaning houses.
Obama	0	In her forties, Rosa Parks was appointed secretary of the Montgomery branch of the NAACP and was active in voter registration drives with the Montgomery Voters League.
Obama	0	In the summer of 1955, she attended the Highlander Folk School, where she took classes in workers' rights and racial equality.
Obama	0	Well before she made headlines across the country, she was a highly respected member of the Montgomery community and a committed member of the civil rights effort.
Obama	0	Of course, her name became permanently etched in American history on December 1, 1955, when she was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus.
Obama	0	It wasn't the first time Rosa Parks refused to acquiesce to the Jim Crow system.
Obama	0	The same bus driver who had her arrested had thrown her off a bus the year before for refusing to give up her seat.
Obama	0	Some schoolchildren are taught that Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat because her feet were tired.
Obama	0	Our nation's schoolbooks are only getting it half right.
Obama	0	She once said: "The only tired I was, was tired of giving in."
Obama	0	This solitary act of civil disobedience became a call to action.
Obama	0	Her arrest led a then relatively unknown pastor, Martin Luther King, Jr., to organize a boycott of the Montgomery bus system.
Obama	0	That boycott lasted 381 days and culminated in a landmark Supreme Court decision finding that the city's segregation policy was unconstitutional.
Obama	0	This solitary act of civil disobedience was also the spark that ignited the beginning of the end for segregation and inspired millions around the country and ultimately around the world to get involved in the fight for racial equality.
Obama	0	Rosa Parks' persistence and determination did not end that day in Montgomery, nor did it end with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act years later.
Obama	0	She stayed active in the NAACP and other civil rights groups for years.
Obama	0	From 1965 to 1988, Ms.
Obama	0	Parks continued her public service by working for my good friend Congressman John Conyers.
Obama	0	And in an example of her low-key demeanor, her job in Congressman Conyers' office did not involve appearances as a figurehead or celebrity; she helped homeless folks find housing.
Obama	0	At the age of 74, she opened the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, which offers education and job training programs for disadvantaged youth.
Obama	0	And even into her 80s, Rosa Parks gave lectures and attended meetings with civil rights groups.
Obama	0	At the age of 86, Rosa Parks' courage and fortitude was recognized by President Bill Clinton, who awarded her the nation's highest honor for a civilian - the Congressional Gold Medal.
Obama	0	As we honor the life of Rosa Parks, we should not limit our commemorations to lofty eulogies.
Obama	0	Instead, let us commit ourselves to carrying on her fight, one solitary act at a time, and ensure that her passion continues to inspire as it did a half-century ago.
Obama	0	That, in my view, is how we can best thank her for her immense contributions to our country.
Obama	0	Rosa Parks once said: "As long as there is unemployment, war, crime and all things that go to the infliction of man's inhumanity to man, regardless - there is much to be done, and people need to work together."
Obama	0	Now that she's passed, it's up to us to make sure that her message is shared.
Obama	0	While we will miss her cherished spirit, let's work to ensure that her legacy lives on in the heart of the nation.
Obama	0	As a personal note, I think it is fair to say were it not for that quiet moment of courage by Mrs.
Obama	0	Parks, I would not be standing here today.
Obama	0	I owe her a great thanks, as does the Nation.
Obama	0	She will be sorely missed.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	I yield the floor.
Obama	0	Teaching Our Kids in a 21st Century Economy  TOPIC: Education October 25, 2005 Teaching Our Kids in a 21st Century Economy Delivered at the Center for American Progress Complete Text  The other day, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation.
Obama	0	In it, he talks about his recent travels to schools across America, and how fifty years after Brown v. Board of Education, we have an education system in this country that is still visibly separate and painfully unequal.
Obama	0	At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he meets some children who explain with heart-wrenching honesty what living in this system is like.
Obama	0	One girl told him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
Obama	0	The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding.
Obama	0	Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story.
Obama	0	And she began to cry.
Obama	0	When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing.
Obama	0	I did not need sewing either.
Obama	0	I knew how to sew.
Obama	0	My mother is a seamstress in a factory.
Obama	0	I'm trying to go to college.
Obama	0	I don't need to sew to go to college.
Obama	0	My mother sews.
Obama	0	I hoped for something else."
Obama	0	I hoped for something else.
Obama	0	It's a simple dream, but it speaks to us so powerfully because it is our dream - one that exists at the very center of the American experience.
Obama	0	One that says if you're willing to work hard and take responsibility, then you'll have the chance to reach for something else; for something better.
Obama	0	The ideal of public education has always been at the heart of this bargain.
Obama	0	From the moment the earliest Americans stepped out from the shadows of tyranny and built the first free schools in the towns of New England and across the Southern plains, it was the driving force behind Thomas Jefferson's declaration that "...talent and virtue, needed in a free society, should be educated regardless of wealth, birth or other accidental condition."
Obama	0	It's a bargain our government kept as we moved from a nation of farms to a nation of factories, setting up a system of free public high schools to give every American the chance to participate in the new economy.
Obama	0	It's a bargain we expanded after World War II, when we sent over two million returning heroes to college on the GI Bill, creating the largest middle class in history.
Obama	0	And even when our government refused to hold up its end of this bargain; when America fell short of its promise and forced Linda Brown to walk miles to a dilapidated Topeka school because she wasn't allowed in the well-off, white-only school near her house; even then, ordinary people marched and bled, they took to the streets and fought in the courts, they stood up and spoke out until the day when the arrival of nine little children at a school in Little Rock made real the decision that in America, separate could never be equal.
Obama	0	Because in America, it's the promise of a good education for all that makes it possible for any child to transcend the barriers of race or class or background and achieve their God-given potential.
Obama	0	In this country, it is education that allows our children to hope for something else.
Obama	0	And as the twenty-first century unfolds, we are called once again to make real this hope - to meet the new challenges of a global economy by carrying forth the ideals of progress and opportunity through public education in America.
Obama	0	We now live in a world where the most valuable skill you can sell is knowledge.
Obama	0	Revolutions in technology and communication have created an entire economy of high-tech, high-wage jobs that can be located anywhere there's an internet connection.
Obama	0	And today, a child in Chicago is not only competing for jobs with one in Boston, but thousands more in Bangalore and Beijing who are being educated longer and better than ever before.
Obama	0	America is in danger of losing this competition.
Obama	0	We now have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized country.
Obama	0	By 12th grade, our children score lower on their math and science tests than most other kids in the world.
Obama	0	And today, countries like China are graduating eight times as many engineers as we do.
Obama	0	And yet, as these fundamental changes are occurring all around this, we still hear about schools that are giving students the choice between hairstyling and braiding.
Obama	0	Let's be clear - we are failing too many of our children.
Obama	0	We're sending them out into a 21st century economy by sending them through the doors of 20th century schools.
Obama	0	Right now, six million middle and high school students are reading at levels significantly below their grade level.
Obama	0	Half of all teenagers can't understand basic fractions; half of all nine year olds can't perform basic multiplication or division.
Obama	0	For some students, the data is even worse: almost 60% of African-American fourth-graders can't read at even the basic level, and by 8th grade, nearly nine in ten African-American and Latino students are not proficient in math.
Obama	0	More students than ever are taking college entrance exams, but these tests are showing that only twenty percent are prepared to take college-level classes in English, math, and science.
Obama	0	For African-American students, the figure dips to just ten percent.
Obama	0	What happens to these kids?
Obama	0	What happens to the one in four eighth graders who never go on to finish high school in five years?
Obama	0	What happens to the one in two high school graduates who never go on to college?
Obama	0	Thirty or forty years ago, they may have gone on to find a factory job that could pay the bills and support a family.
Obama	0	But we no longer live in that world.
Obama	0	Today, the average salary of a high school graduate is only $33,000 a year.
Obama	0	For high school dropouts, it's even closer to the poverty line - just $25,000.
Obama	0	If we do nothing about this, if we accept this kind of economy; this kind of society, we face a future where the ideal of American meritocracy could turn into an American myth.
Obama	0	A future that's not only morally unacceptable for our children; but economically untenable for a nation that finds itself in a globalized world, as countries who are out-educating us today out-compete our workers tomorrow.
Obama	0	Now, the American people understand that government alone can't meet this challenge.
Obama	0	They understand that we need to transform our educational culture, from one of complacency to one that constantly strives for excellence.
Obama	0	And they understand that government cannot replace parents as the primary motivator for the hard work and commitment that excellence requires.
Obama	0	But they also know that government, through the public schools, plays a critical role.
Obama	0	And what they've seen from government for close to two decades is not innovation or bold calls to action.
Obama	0	Instead, what they've seen is inaction and tinkering around the edges of our education system - a paralysis that is fueled by ideological battles that are as outdated as they are predictable.
Obama	0	You know the arguments.
Obama	0	On one side, you'll here conservatives who will look at children without textbooks and classrooms without computers and say money doesn't matter.
Obama	0	On the other side, you'll find liberals who will look at failing test scores and failing schools and not realize how much reform matters.
Obama	0	One side will blame teachers, and the other side will never ask them to change.
Obama	0	Some will say that no matter what you do, some children just can't learn.
Obama	0	Others will make excuses for them when they won't learn.
Obama	0	Some will say that the same public school system that succeeded for generations must now be dismantled and privatized, no matter who it leaves behind.
Obama	0	And others will defend the status quo in these schools even when they fail to teach our kids.
Obama	0	Like most ideological debates, this one assumes that there's an "either-or" answer to our education problems.
Obama	0	Either we need to pour more money into the system, or we need to reform it with more tests and standards.
Obama	0	But we don't make much progress for our kids when we constrain ourselves like this.
Obama	0	It appeared for a brief moment that the President, working with leaders like Senator Kennedy understood this, and many of us were initially encouraged by the passage of No Child Left Behind.
Obama	0	It may not be popular to say in Democratic circles, but there were good elements to this bill - its emphasis on the achievement gap, raising standards, and accountability.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, because of failures in implementation, particularly its failure to provide adequate funding and a failure to design better assessment tests that provide a clearer path for schools to raise achievement, the bill's promise is not yet fulfilled.
Obama	0	The shortcomings of NCLB shouldn't end the conversation, however.
Obama	0	They should be the start of a conversation about how we can do better.
Obama	0	Yes, it's a moral outrage that this Administration hasn't come through with the funding for what it claims has been its number one domestic priority.
Obama	0	But to wage war against the entire law for that reason is not an education policy, and Democrats need to realize that.
Obama	0	If we truly believe in our public schools, then we have a moral responsibility to do better - to break the either-or mentality around school reform, and embrace a both-and mentality.
Obama	0	Good schools will require both the structural reform and the resources necessary to prepare our kids for the future.
Obama	0	It's not as if innovation isn't taking place around the country.
Obama	0	It's taking place in wealthier schools, like Illinois' Adlai Stevenson High School, which has one of the highest percentages of students taking AP exams in the country, and California's New Tech High, which puts a computer in front of every child.
Obama	0	But it's also taking place in schools where large majorities of children find themselves below the poverty line yet above the national average in achievement -- places like Newark's Branch Book Elementary and Chicago's Carson Elementary School.
Obama	0	The problem is that we are not applying what we've learned from these successes to inform national policy.
Obama	0	We need new vision for education in America - one where we move past ideology to experiment with the latest reforms, measure the results, and make policy decisions based on what works and what doesn't.
Obama	0	Now, if we are going to learn from schools that work, we must begin by admitting the obvious: money matters.
Obama	0	In too many places, kids are going to school in trailers where rats are more numerous than computers.
Obama	0	Smaller classes, books and lab supplies, better paid teachers, modernized buildings with the latest technology - all of this is critical if we are serious about educating our next generation.
Obama	0	But money alone won't make a difference without reform.
Obama	0	And by the way, we won't be able to muster the political will to get more money into the system unless taxpayers are convinced that the money will produce measurable results.
Obama	0	Fortunately, those who work in the field know what reforms really work: a more challenging and rigorous curriculum with emphasis on math, science, and literacy skills.
Obama	0	Longer hours and more days to give kids the time and attention they need to learn.
Obama	0	Early childhood education for every child so they're not left behind before they even start school.
Obama	0	Meaningful, performance-based assessments that can give us a fuller picture of how a student is doing.
Obama	0	And putting effective teachers and transformative principals in front of our kids.
Obama	0	All of these reforms need to be scaled-up and replicated across the country.
Obama	0	But in the time I have remaining, let me use just talk about a few to point to what's possible, starting with one place where I think we can start making a big difference in education right now.
Obama	0	From the moment our children step into a classroom, new evidence shows that the single most important factor in determining their achievement today is not the color of their skin or where they come from; it's not who their parents are or how much money they have.
Obama	0	It's who their teacher is.
Obama	0	It's the person who will brave some of the most difficult schools, the most challenging children, and accept the most meager compensation simply to give someone else the chance to succeed.
Obama	0	One study shows that two groups of students who started third grade at about the same level of math achievement finished fifth grade at vastly different levels.
Obama	0	The group with the effective teacher saw their scores rise by nearly 25%.
Obama	0	The group with the ineffective teacher actually saw their scores drop by 25%.
Obama	0	But even though we know how much teaching matters, in too many places we've abandoned our teachers, sending them into some of the most impoverished, underperforming schools with little experience or pay; little preparation or support.
Obama	0	After a few years of experience, most will leave to pick wealthier, less challenging schools.
Obama	0	The result is that some of our neediest children end up with less-experienced, poorly-paid teachers who are far more likely to be teaching subjects in which they have no training.
Obama	0	Minority students are twice as likely to have these teachers.
Obama	0	In Illinois, students in high-poverty schools are more than three times as likely to have them.
Obama	0	The No Child Left Behind law, which states that all kids should have highly qualified teachers, is supposed to correct this, but so far it hasn't, because no one's followed through on the promise.
Obama	0	If we hope to give our children a chance, it's time we start giving our teachers a chance.
Obama	0	We can't change the whole country overnight.
Obama	0	But what we can do is give more school districts the chance to revolutionize the way they approach teaching.
Obama	0	By helping spark complete reform across an entire school district, we can learn what actually works for our kids and then replicate those policies throughout the country.
Obama	0	So here's what I'm proposing: the creation of what I call Innovation Districts.
Obama	0	School districts from around the country that want to become seedbeds of reform would apply and we'd select the twenty with the best plans to put effective, supported teachers in all classrooms and increase achievement for all students.
Obama	0	We'd offer these districts substantial new resources to do this, but in return, we'd ask them to try systemic new reforms.
Obama	0	Above all, we'd require results.
Obama	0	In Innovation Districts, we'd ask for reforms in four broad areas: teaching, most importantly, but also how teachers use their time, what they teach, and what we can do to hold our schools accountable for achievement.
Obama	0	We'd begin by working with these districts to strengthen their teaching, and we'd start with recruitment.
Obama	0	Right now we don't have nearly enough effective teachers in the places we need them most: urban and rural schools, and subject areas like math and science.
Obama	0	One of the main reasons for this, cited by most teachers who leave the profession, is that no one gives them the necessary training and preparation.
Obama	0	Around the country, organizations like the Academy for Urban School Leadership in Chicago are changing this by recruiting and training new, highly-qualified teachers for some of the hardest-to-teach classrooms in the country.
Obama	0	We need to expand this by giving districts help in creating new teacher academies that will partner with organizations like this to recruit effective teachers for low-performing, high-poverty schools.
Obama	0	Each teacher would undergo an extensive training program before they begin, including classroom observation and participation.
Obama	0	After we recruit great teachers, we need to pay them better.
Obama	0	Right now, teaching is one of the only professions where no matter how well you perform at your job, you're almost never rewarded for success.
Obama	0	But with six-figure salaries luring away some of our most talented college graduates from some of our neediest schools, this needs to change.
Obama	0	That's why teachers in these Innovation Districts who are successful in improving student achievement would receive substantial pay increases, as would those who choose to teach in the most troubled schools and the highest-need subject areas, like math and science.
Obama	0	The city of Denver is trying pay increases in partnership with the local union, and when Chattanooga, Tennessee offered similar incentives for teachers who taught in high-need schools, student reading scores went up by over 10%.
Obama	0	Of course, teachers don't just need more pay, they need more support.
Obama	0	One thing I kept hearing when I visited Dodge Elementary School in Chicago is how much an encouraging principal or the advice of an experienced teacher can make a difference.
Obama	0	That's why teachers would be paired with mentor teachers who've been there before.
Obama	0	After a few years of experience, they'd then have the chance to become mentor teachers themselves.
Obama	0	And to help them deal with those few disruptive students who tend to slow down the rest of the class - a problem I hear about from teachers all the time - we'd expand innovative programs being used in states like Illinois that teach students about positive behavior.
Obama	0	Finally, we would also require Innovation Districts to work with their unions to uncover bureaucratic obstacles that leave poor kids without good teachers, including hiring, funding and transfer policies.
Obama	0	Districts would work with unions to tackle these problems so that we can provide every child with an effective teacher.
Obama	0	Beyond policies that help teachers specifically, we'd also ask Innovation Districts to try reforms that create a more effective teaching environment.
Obama	0	To give teachers more time with their students and more time to learn from each other, these districts would be asked to restructure their schedules and implement either longer days or summer school.
Obama	0	In addition to more learning, this would provide kids a safe, educational environment while their parents are at work.
Obama	0	And we'd make sure that in every school district across the country, educators are teaching a curriculum that will prepare our kids for the global economy.
Obama	0	In many states, students are taught the anatomy of a flower as many as six times over the course of their education.
Obama	0	Yet, they are never taught what they need to become a productive citizen in a global economy - like computer technology, how the economy works, why skyscrapers stand, or how to design a new product.
Obama	0	Some states are successfully using this kind of project-based learning to give our kids real world, hands-on experience in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math.
Obama	0	We will provide funding for more of this learning in more of our schools.
Obama	0	To hold schools and teachers accountable for the results of all these reforms, Innovation Districts would be asked to support schools that succeed and shut down those that don't.
Obama	0	To find out what works and what doesn't, we'd provide them with powerful data and technology, and also give them the option of partnering with local universities to help them improve performance, like what happens at the University of Chicago's Urban Education Initiative.
Obama	0	Schools that raise student achievement would be given bonuses.
Obama	0	For schools that don't improve, the districts would close them and replace them with new, smaller schools that can replicate some of the successful reforms taking place elsewhere.
Obama	0	Entire districts that do not improve would be removed from the program.
Obama	0	These reforms would take an important first step toward fixing our broken system by putting qualified, supported teachers in the schools that need them most.
Obama	0	But beyond that, they would show us the progress we can make when money is well spent.
Obama	0	And they would allow us to finally break free from the either-or mentality that's put bureaucracy and ideology ahead of what works; ahead of what's best for our kids.
Obama	0	When it comes to education, the time for excuses has passed - for all of us.
Obama	0	During my visit to Dodge Elementary, I was able to speak with a few of the teachers about some of the challenges they're facing in educating their students.
Obama	0	And one teacher mentioned to me that in one of the biggest obstacles in her view is what she referred to as the "These Kids" syndrome.
Obama	0	She said that when it comes to educating students today, people always seem to find a million excuses for why "these kids" can't learn.
Obama	0	That you'll hear how "these kids are nothing but trouble," or "these kids come from tough backgrounds," or "these kids don't want to learn."
Obama	0	And the more people talk about them as "these kids," the easier it is for "these kids" to become somebody else's problem.
Obama	0	But of course, the children in this country - the children in Dodge Elementary, and South Central L.A., and rural Arkansas, and suburban Maryland - they are not "these kids."
Obama	0	They are our kids.
Obama	0	They want a chance to achieve - and each of us has a responsibility to give them that chance.
Obama	0	In the end, children succeed because somewhere along the way, a parent or teacher instills in them the belief that they can.
Obama	0	That they're able to.
Obama	0	That they're worth it.
Obama	0	At Earhart Elementary in Chicago, one little girl, raised by a single mom from a poor background, was asked the secret to her academic success.
Obama	0	She said, "I just study hard every night because I like learning.
Obama	0	My teacher wants me to be a good student, and so does my mother.
Obama	0	I don't want to let them down."
Obama	0	In the months and years to come, it's time for this nation to rededicate itself to the ideal of a world class education for every American child.
Obama	0	It's time to let our kids hope for something else.
Obama	0	It's time to instill the belief in every child that they can succeed - and then make sure we make good on the promise to never let them down.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	AVIAN FLU REMARKS ON THE U.S. SENATE FLOOR  TOPIC: Healthcare & Health Issues October 18, 2005 Avian Flu Remarks U.S. Senate floor Washington, DC Complete Text We are continuing to witness the relentless spread of avian flu, carried slowly but predictably by wild, migratory birds from countries in Southeast Asia to Western China, to Mongolia, and then over the Ural Mountains into Russia and Ukraine.
Obama	0	From there, avian flu has spread over the past week to Romania and Turkey, and we have just learned, possibly into Greece.
Obama	0	Dr. Joseph Domenech, chief of the Animal Health Service at the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization, has been quoted as saying that "...we are not surprised."
Obama	0	Mr. President, at this point, no one should be surprised.
Obama	0	The experts have told us repeatedly that a flu pandemic is inevitable, although the timing is unpredictable.
Obama	0	In other words, the question is not if, but when.
Obama	0	This spread of avian flu is our warning signal, and we need to heed this call to action.
Obama	0	If we're lucky, we'll have at least a year, or perhaps several years, to prepare for a flu pandemic.
Obama	0	But we might not be so lucky.
Obama	0	And regardless of whether it is this particular strain of avian flu, H5N1, or another deadly strain, the time to act is long overdue if we want to prevent unprecedented human suffering, death, and economic devastation.
Obama	0	International health experts say that two of the three conditions for an avian flu pandemic in Southeast Asia already exist.
Obama	0	First, a new strain of the virus has emerged to which humans have little or no immunity.
Obama	0	Second, this strain has shown that it can jump between species.
Obama	0	The last condition--the ability for the virus to travel efficiently from human to human--has not been met, and it is the only thing preventing a full blown pandemic.
Obama	0	Once this virus mutates and can be transmitted from human to human, we will not be able to contain this disease.
Obama	0	Because of the wonders of modern travel, a person could board a plane in Bangkok, Athens, or Bucharest and land in Chicago less than a day later, unknowingly carrying the virus.
Obama	0	Indeed, we learned this lesson from SARS, which moved quickly from Asia to Canada, where it led to many deaths.
Obama	0	As my colleagues know, one of my top priorities since arriving in the Senate has been increasing awareness about the avian flu.
Obama	0	In April of this year, I introduced the AVIAN Act, which is a comprehensive bill to increase our preparedness for an avian flu pandemic.
Obama	0	This bill was incorporated into a larger bill, the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act, that Senator Reid and I introduced two weeks ago.
Obama	0	We need to move this bill as quickly as possible.
Obama	0	We also need to provide more funding to purchase vaccines and antivirals and improve our ability to spot and isolate a pandemic as soon as it begins.
Obama	0	In the spring and summer, I worked to secure $35 million in funding to fight the avian flu.
Obama	0	Today, some of this money is already helping the World Health Organization to step up its international surveillance and response efforts.
Obama	0	But clearly much more money is needed.
Obama	0	Last month, I joined Senator Harkin and others in offering an amendment to the DOD appropriations bill to provide almost $4 billion to fight the avian flu.
Obama	0	I am pleased that Senator Stevens cosponsored the amendment and it was accepted into the appropriations bill.
Obama	0	I hope that the House will agree to this funding in conference.
Obama	0	Although we have begun to step up to the plate in the Senate, it is unfortunate that none of the avian flu bills that have been introduced have passed into law.
Obama	0	Frankly, there's been a lot of talk, but not enough action.
Obama	0	And this isn't just true of the Congress.
Obama	0	One year after publishing the draft pandemic flu plan, the Administration has still not released the final HHS Pandemic Flu Preparedness Plan.
Obama	0	Half of states haven't published plans either, and we know that many of these states will need substantial help.
Obama	0	This lack of planning is compounded by the fact that we still don't have a FDA approved vaccine against avian flu, and the one drug that many countries are relying on--Tamiflu--may be less effective than experts had thought.
Obama	0	The manufacturer is also struggling to meet the demand, and it could take up to 2 years for it to make enough for the U.S. stockpile, presuming this Administration finally puts in an order for the drug.
Obama	0	I would ask my colleagues how many hearings and briefings that they have sat through where witnesses and experts have urged the United States government to be better prepared for these types of crises.
Obama	0	The failure to prepare for emergencies can have devastating consequences.
Obama	0	We learned that lesson the hard way after Hurricane Katrina.
Obama	0	This nation must not be caught off-guard when faced with the prospect of an avian flu pandemic.
Obama	0	The consequences are too high.
Obama	0	The flyways for migratory birds are well-established.
Obama	0	We know that avian flu will likely hit the United States in a matter of time.
Obama	0	With the regular flu season coming up shortly, conditions will be favorable for reassortment of the avian flu virus with the annual flu virus.
Obama	0	Such reassortment could lead to a mutated virus that could be transmitted efficiently between humans, which is the last condition needed for pandemic flu.
Obama	0	The question is will we be ready when that happens?
Obama	0	Let's make sure that answer is yes.
Obama	0	I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to push this Administration to take the action needed to prevent a catastrophe that we have not seen during our lifetimes.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	I yield the floor.
Obama	0	CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE JOHN ROBERTS  TOPIC: Confirmations Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Confirmation of Judge John Roberts Complete Text First of all, let me congratulate Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for moving the process of confirming the nomination of Judge Roberts along with such civility, a civility that I believe speaks well of the Senate.
Obama	0	Let me also say that I remain distressed that the White House during this confirmation process, which overall went smoothly, failed to provide critical documents as part of the record that could have provided us with a better basis to make our judgment with respect to the nomination.
Obama	0	This White House continues to stymie efforts on the part of the Senate to do its job.
Obama	0	I hope with the next nominee who comes up for the Supreme Court that the White House recognizes that in fact it is its duty not just to the Senate but to the American people to make sure we can thoroughly and adequately evaluate the record of every single nominee who comes before us.
Obama	0	Having said that, the decision with respect to Judge Roberts' nomination has not been an easy one for me to make.
Obama	0	As some of you know, I have not only argued cases before appellate courts but for 10 years was a member of the University of Chicago Law School faculty and taught courses in constitutional law.
Obama	0	Part of the culture of the University of Chicago Law School faculty is to maintain a sense of collegiality between those people who hold different views.
Obama	0	What engenders respect is not the particular outcome that a legal scholar arrives at but, rather, the intellectual rigor and honesty with which he or she arrives at a decision.
Obama	0	Given that background, I am sorely tempted to vote for Judge Roberts based on my study of his resume, his conduct during the hearings, and a conversation I had with him yesterday afternoon.
Obama	0	There is absolutely no doubt in my mind Judge Roberts is qualified to sit on the highest court in the land.
Obama	0	Moreover, he seems to have the comportment and the temperament that makes for a good judge.
Obama	0	He is humble, he is personally decent, and he appears to be respectful of different points of view.
Obama	0	It is absolutely clear to me that Judge Roberts truly loves the law.
Obama	0	He couldn't have achieved his excellent record as an advocate before the Supreme Court without that passion for the law, and it became apparent to me in our conversation that he does, in fact, deeply respect the basic precepts that go into deciding 95 percent of the cases that come before the Federal court -- adherence to precedence, a certain modesty in reading statutes and constitutional text, a respect for procedural regularity, and an impartiality in presiding over the adversarial system.
Obama	0	All of these characteristics make me want to vote for Judge Roberts.
Obama	0	The problem I face -- a problem that has been voiced by some of my other colleagues, both those who are voting for Mr. Roberts and those who are voting against Mr. Roberts -- is that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 percent of the cases that come before a court, so that both a Scalia and a Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the time on those 95 percent of the cases -- what matters on the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult.
Obama	0	In those cases, adherence to precedent and rules of construction and interpretation will only get you through the 25th mile of the marathon.
Obama	0	That last mile can only be determined on the basis of one's deepest values, one's core concerns, one's broader perspectives on how the world works, and the depth and breadth of one's empathy.
Obama	0	In those 5 percent of hard cases, the constitutional text will not be directly on point.
Obama	0	The language of the statute will not be perfectly clear.
Obama	0	Legal process alone will not lead you to a rule of decision.
Obama	0	In those circumstances, your decisions about whether affirmative action is an appropriate response to the history of discrimination in this country or whether a general right of privacy encompasses a more specific right of women to control their reproductive decisions or whether the commerce clause empowers Congress to speak on those issues of broad national concern that may be only tangentially related to what is easily defined as interstate commerce, whether a person who is disabled has the right to be accommodated so they can work alongside those who are nondisabled -- in those difficult cases, the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge's heart.
Obama	0	I talked to Judge Roberts about this.
Obama	0	Judge Roberts confessed that, unlike maybe professional politicians, it is not easy for him to talk about his values and his deeper feelings.
Obama	0	That is not how he is trained.
Obama	0	He did say he doesn't like bullies and has always viewed the law as a way of evening out the playing field between the strong and the weak.
Obama	0	I was impressed with that statement because I view the law in much the same way.
Obama	0	The problem I had is that when I examined Judge Roberts' record and history of public service, it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak.
Obama	0	In his work in the White House and the Solicitor General's Office, he seemed to have consistently sided with those who were dismissive of efforts to eradicate the remnants of racial discrimination in our political process.
Obama	0	In these same positions, he seemed dismissive of the concerns that it is harder to make it in this world and in this economy when you are a woman rather than a man.
Obama	0	I want to take Judge Roberts at his word that he doesn't like bullies and he sees the law and the Court as a means of evening the playing field between the strong and the weak.
Obama	0	But given the gravity of the position to which he will undoubtedly ascend and the gravity of the decisions in which he will undoubtedly participate during his tenure on the Court, I ultimately have to give more weight to his deeds and the overarching political philosophy that he appears to have shared with those in power than to the assuring words that he provided me in our meeting.
Obama	0	The bottom line is this: I will be voting against John Roberts' nomination.
Obama	0	I do so with considerable reticence.
Obama	0	I hope that I am wrong.
Obama	0	I hope that this reticence on my part proves unjustified and that Judge Roberts will show himself to not only be an outstanding legal thinker but also someone who upholds the Court's historic role as a check on the majoritarian impulses of the executive branch and the legislative branch.
Obama	0	I hope that he will recognize who the weak are and who the strong are in our society.
Obama	0	I hope that his jurisprudence is one that stands up to the bullies of all ideological stripes.
Obama	0	Let me conclude with just one more comment about this confirmation process.
Obama	0	I was deeply disturbed by some statements that were made by largely Democratic advocacy groups when ranking member Senator Leahy announced that he would support Judge Roberts.
Obama	0	Although the scales have tipped in a different direction for me, I am deeply admiring of the work and the thought that Senator Leahy has put into making his decision.
Obama	0	The knee-jerk unbending and what I consider to be unfair attacks on Senator Leahy's motives were unjustified.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, both parties have fallen victim to this kind of pressure.
Obama	0	I believe every Senator on the other side of the aisle, if they were honest, would acknowledge that the same unyielding, unbending, dogmatic approach to judicial confirmation has in large part been responsible for the kind of poisonous atmosphere that exists in this Chamber regarding judicial nominations.
Obama	0	It is tempting, then, for us on this side of the aisle to go tit for tat.
Obama	0	But what I would like to see is for all of us to recognize as we move forward to the next nominee that in fact the issues that are confronted by the Supreme Court are difficult issues.
Obama	0	That is why they get up to the Supreme Court.
Obama	0	The issues facing the Court are rarely black and white, and all advocacy groups who have a legitimate and profound interest in the decisions that are made by the Court should try to make certain that their advocacy reflects that complexity.
Obama	0	These groups on the right and left should not resort to the sort of broad-brush dogmatic attacks that have hampered the process in the past and constrained each and every Senator in this Chamber from making sure that they are voting on the basis of their conscience.
Obama	0	Thank you very much.
Obama	0	RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE  TOPIC: Oil & Alternative Fuels September 15, 2005 Resources for the Future 1616 P Street, NW Washington, DC Complete Text  As the flood waters recede in New Orleans and the survivors of Katrina begin to rebuild their lives, one truth has become achingly clear over the past few weeks: Our government wasn't ready to save its own citizens from a catastrophe of biblical proportions.
Obama	0	It wasn't even close.
Obama	0	Despite years of planning, preparing, and warnings from countless scientists, experts, and government officials - that the levees would break, that our first responders didn't have the best tools for communication, that FEMA was under-funded and undervalued - despite all of this, Katrina caught the government off-guard, flat-footed, and dangerously disorganized.
Obama	0	The most tragic consequence of this slow response was the incalculable loss of human life.
Obama	0	But miles off the Gulf Coast, as the deadly storm first raged towards shore, another frightening consequence emerged from our government's failure to prepare.
Obama	0	In the moments before the hurricane hit, Gulf refineries that made up one-eighth of our country's total capacity were evacuated and shut down.
Obama	0	95% of oil production was immediately suspended in a region where we find over a quarter of America's oil.
Obama	0	And gas prices that were already at record highs shot up even further all over the country - reaching $6 a gallon in some places.
Obama	0	Today, they're hovering over $3 - a price that experts say will remain for the rest of the year.
Obama	0	And what we don't see on television is how in a few months, the price of home heating oil and natural gas will reach new heights as well.
Obama	0	It would be one thing if this storm struck at a time of stability.
Obama	0	But over the last few years, limited supplies and an unprecedented growth in demand have sent the global oil market itself teetering towards the edge of disaster.
Obama	0	With our own Energy Department telling us that U.S. demand for oil will jump 40% over the next twenty years and countries like China and India adding millions of cars to their roads, the price of oil is reaching levels we just can't handle anymore.
Obama	0	A few years ago, we paid just $25 for a barrel of oil.
Obama	0	Today, we're paying around $63.
Obama	0	Since this affects the price of everything from gas to airfare to groceries, analysts at Global Insight, an economic consulting firm, say that if we hit $100 a barrel, the U.S. economy could very well tumble into recession.
Obama	0	Which brings me to one of the central lessons of Katrina, one that goes far beyond the gas hikes and the price gouging we're facing today: The days of running a 21st century economy on a 20th century fossil fuel are numbered - and we need to realize that before it's too late.
Obama	0	Our persistent dependence on oil is a danger our government has known about for years.
Obama	0	And despite constant warnings by researchers and scientists, major corporations and our own government officials, it's a danger they have failed to prepare for, listen to, or seriously try to guard against.
Obama	0	It's a danger we can no longer afford to ignore.
Obama	0	Katrina, after all, was a natural disaster that affected only our domestic oil supply.
Obama	0	But just imagine the threat to our national security from a geopolitical disaster - a war or an embargo - that cut off our supply from the rest of the world, where we get most of our oil.
Obama	0	Right now, we depend on some of the most politically volatile countries in the Middle East and elsewhere to fuel our energy needs.
Obama	0	It doesn't matter if they're budding democracies, despotic regimes with nuclear intentions, or havens for the madrassas that plant the seeds of terror in young minds - they get our money because we need their oil.
Obama	0	What's worse - it's oil that's not very well protected.
Obama	0	Over the last few years, we know that terrorists have stepped up their attempts to launch attacks on the poorly defended oil tankers and pipelines of the Middle East.
Obama	0	And a former CIA agent tells us that if a terrorist hijacked a plane in Kuwait and crashed it into an oil complex in Saudi Arabia, it could take enough oil off the market to cause more economic damage than a direct attack on the United States.
Obama	0	At that point, $6 a gallon would look like a steal.
Obama	0	Hopefully, this short-term, hurricane-induced oil crisis will subside.
Obama	0	But the clear and present danger to our economy and our security from America's long-term dependency on oil will not subside - unless we act now.
Obama	0	In fact, it will only get worse.
Obama	0	As usual, the American people are already way ahead of Washington.
Obama	0	Whether it's Galesburg farmers growing the corn that can fuel our cars or the Chicago factory workers making the microchip that let's us plug them in, people across the country have been taking America's energy future into their own hands with the same sense of innovation and optimism that sent the Wright brothers into the sky, led Dr. Salk to a cure for polio, and fueled Henry Ford's confidence that his workers could afford the cars they made.
Obama	0	But for too long now, this can-do spirit has been stifled by a can't-do government that seems to think it has no role in solving great national challenges or rallying a country to a cause.
Obama	0	One that's content with simply giving more tax breaks to energy industries without asking for anything in return.
Obama	0	Content with sending $650 million a day to countries like Saudi Arabia to pay for our fuel.
Obama	0	And content with energy legislation that takes on only the easiest parts of the problem.
Obama	0	Now, I voted for the last energy bill.
Obama	0	Because it took some baby steps in the right direction.
Obama	0	It invests in the renewable, homegrown biofuels that could turn out to be some of the most promising alternatives to oil.
Obama	0	It contains some provisions that would help us use alternative energy sources, increase our refinery capacity, and invest in clean coal technology.
Obama	0	And recently, the administration made some executive policy changes that make it more difficult to classify cars as "light trucks," which would increase the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
Obama	0	None of these provisions do any harm - and a few do some good.
Obama	0	But the energy bill and the administration's reforms don't suffer from sins of commission.
Obama	0	Instead, they suffer from sins of omission.
Obama	0	The solutions are too timid - the reforms too small.
Obama	0	A bill that reduces our dependency on foreign oil by just 3% when our demand is about to jump 40% is not a serious energy policy.
Obama	0	We need to do more.
Obama	0	The truth is, an oil future is not a secure future for America.
Obama	0	Indeed, the rest of the world is already moving away from oil, and the longer we wait, the more difficult and painful it will be for our companies and our workers to catch up.
Obama	0	Countries like China and Japan are creating jobs and slowing oil consumption by churning out and buying millions of fuel-efficient cars.
Obama	0	Brazil, a nation that once relied on foreign countries to import 80% of its crude oil, will now be entirely self-sufficient in a few years thanks to its investment in biofuels.
Obama	0	By getting more ethanol on the market and equipping their cars with the flexible-fuel engines that allow them to run on this fuel, Brazil has succeeded secured its energy supply while still giving consumers a break at the pump.
Obama	0	So why can't we do this?
Obama	0	Why can't this be one of the great American projects of the 21st century?
Obama	0	The answer is, it can.
Obama	0	We can do this with technology we have on the shelves right now; we can do it by saving, not crippling, our ailing auto companies; and we can do it by using the kind of clean, renewable sources of energy that we can literally grow right here in America.
Obama	0	There's no silver bullet.
Obama	0	A solution to our energy dilemma won't come overnight.
Obama	0	But we don't have to accept the wait-and-see attitude anymore.
Obama	0	It flies in the face of our history and our founding principles.
Obama	0	Katrina has shown us what could happen if we don't move away from an oil economy, but it has also provided us with a moment to challenge that kind of a future.
Obama	0	Now is the time to seize that moment.
Obama	0	In the short-term, this probably means that we'll need to build even more refinery capacity and create not just a Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but also a Strategic Gasoline Reserve so that we can deal with the type of shortages we saw from Katrina.
Obama	0	It means that we'll need to invest more in the clean technology that will allow us to burn more coal, our country's most abundant fossil fuel.
Obama	0	And it means that we should continue to encourage the use of renewable fuels - by insisting that they make up 20% of our energy use and making sure that every new car in America has a flexible-fuel engine by 2010.
Obama	0	But we need to take even greater steps than these short-term measures.
Obama	0	We need solutions that strike at the very heart of our dependence on oil.
Obama	0	Right now, the largest consumers of oil in this country are the cars we drive.
Obama	0	And right now, we also have the technology to build cars that travel much further on a gallon of gas.
Obama	0	We already have thousands of gas-electric hybrid cars driving around that can get 50 miles per gallon.
Obama	0	Soon, plug-in hybrids will be able to get 75 miles per gallon.
Obama	0	And experts believe that if we pump biofuels like E85 into a plug-in hybrid car, we can actually get up to 500 miles per gallon of gasoline.
Obama	0	So the technology is on the shelf.
Obama	0	It's ready and available for our car companies to use.
Obama	0	If we made sure that all passenger vehicles built in the U.S. got 40 miles per gallon, we would save consumers up to $5,000 at the pump over the life of their cars.
Obama	0	If we do this alone, we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil by over 1 billion barrels a year by 2020.
Obama	0	For years, we've hesitated to raise fuel economy standards as a nation in part because of a very legitimate concern - the impact it would have on Detroit.
Obama	0	The auto industry is right when they argue that transitioning to more hybrid and fuel-efficient cars would require massive investment at a time when they're struggling under the weight of rising health care costs, sagging profits, and stiff competition from Europe and Japan.
Obama	0	But it's precisely because of that competition that they don't have a choice.
Obama	0	As the demand and waiting lists for hybrid cars skyrocket, demand for SUVs - American car companies' biggest source of profit - is expected to plummet.
Obama	0	The market is telling the auto industry to move away from oil - but so far only foreign companies are listening.
Obama	0	China now has a higher fuel economy standard than we do, and it's got 200,000 hybrids on its roads.
Obama	0	Japan's Toyota is doubling production of the popular Prius to sell 100,000 in the U.S. this year, and it's getting ready to open a brand new production plant in China.
Obama	0	These companies are running circles around their American counterparts.
Obama	0	Ford is only making 20,000 Escape Hybrids this year, and GM's brand won't be on the market until 2007.
Obama	0	This isn't just costing us energy efficiency - it's decimating American businesses and costing American workers their jobs.
Obama	0	There is now no doubt that fuel-efficient cars represent the future of the auto industry.
Obama	0	These cars will be built and bought and mass quantities.
Obama	0	The only question is where and by who?
Obama	0	If American car companies hope to be a part of that future, if they hope to compete - if they hope to survive - they must make the necessary adjustments so that they can start building these cars.
Obama	0	And we must help them do it.
Obama	0	There are many ways to do this and many good conversations that already taking place.
Obama	0	One option is to provide direct subsidies to the auto industries so that it can transition its production to more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Obama	0	Others have suggested providing tax credits for consumers to buy these cars.
Obama	0	Today I'd like to give you another example of a deal that Washington could make with Detroit.
Obama	0	We'd start by raising the fuel economy standards in this country by 3% a year over the next fifteen years.
Obama	0	But to help our auto industry make the transition - to give them the competitive edge they need against their foreign counterparts - we'd pay for part of the biggest costs they face today: retiree health care.
Obama	0	Right now, health care costs represent $1,500 of the price of every GM car that's made.
Obama	0	By picking up part of the tab for the health care costs of their retirees, we'd be lifting a huge burden off the auto industry so that they'll invest in the technology that will finally reduce America's dependence on foreign oil.
Obama	0	These solutions - investing in more hybrids and renewable energy sources; raising CAFE standards and helping our auto industry transition to a fuel-efficient future - represent a road to energy independence that will require some tough decisions and difficult politics, but as we look toward the future, it's the road we must travel as a nation.
Obama	0	We could open up every square inch of America to drilling and we still wouldn't even make a dent in our oil dependency.
Obama	0	We could open up ANWR today, and at its peak, which would be more than a decade from now, it would give us enough oil to take care of our transportation needs for about a month.
Obama	0	Clearly, this is not a solution.
Obama	0	At the dawn of the Internet Age, Andy Grove of Intel famously said that there are two kinds of businesses: those that use email and those that will.
Obama	0	Today, there are two kinds of car companies: those who make fuel-efficient cars and those that will.
Obama	0	We can't follow the world anymore.
Obama	0	We must lead.
Obama	0	And if we don't act now, the economic and societal benefits that have always been the hallmark of American innovation will find a home somewhere else.
Obama	0	There are few issues in American politics that have such a far-reaching effect on almost every aspect of our well-being as a nation, yet remain so absent from public interest and action.
Obama	0	But as we cut through all the talk and the politics in the energy debate, we can see what the debate is really about.
Obama	0	We see the family that thinks twice about what they'll spend at the grocery store this week, because they've been paying $40 to fill up the tank for the last month.
Obama	0	We see the grandmother who isn't sure how she'll make her Social Security check cover January's heating bill.
Obama	0	The autoworker who isn't sure what the future at Ford holds for him.
Obama	0	And the mother who sees turmoil in the Middle East and worries that someday her son might have to fight to secure our oil supply.
Obama	0	Ultimately, we see a nation that cannot control its future as long as it cannot control the source of energy that keeps it running.
Obama	0	Recently, I returned from a trip to Ukraine, where I had the opportunity to meet the nation's third president, Viktor Yushchenko.
Obama	0	Since the country first broke away from the Soviet Union more than a decade earlier, Ukraine has been trying to forge its own identity and assert its own independence from Russia.
Obama	0	This culminated earlier this year in the Orange Revolution, a mass demonstration from thousands of protestors who stood by Yushchenko and his promise to move his country further from the sphere of Russian influence.
Obama	0	President Yushchenko finally won.
Obama	0	But today, Ukraine remains almost entirely dependent on - guess who -- Russia - for all it's oil and gas supplies.
Obama	0	And it is widely expected that in anticipation of next year's parliamentary elections, Russia will triple the prices of both.
Obama	0	Despite all the soaring rhetoric, the demonstrations and the courage, Ukraine still finds itself at the mercy of its former patron - a nation that can now influence every political and economic decision they make - all because of oil.
Obama	0	This will not be America's future - but this is the stranglehold that fossil fuels can have on a nation's freedom.
Obama	0	Ukraine may have little choice in the matter.
Obama	0	The most powerful and wealthy nation on earth, teeming with brilliant minds and cutting-edge technology, surely does.
Obama	0	The genius of the American people has already shown us the path towards energy independence, now they're just waiting for their government to take them there.
Obama	0	Let's finally get it done.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	HURRICANE KATRINA RELIEF EFFORTS  TOPIC: Katrina & Gulf Recovery September 6, 2005 Statement of Senator Barack Obama Hurricane Katrina Relief Efforts Complete Text  I just got back from a trip to Houston with former Presidents Clinton and Bush.
Obama	0	And as we wandered through the crowd, we heard in very intimate terms the heart-wrenching stories that all of us have witnessed from a distance over the past several days: mothers separated from babies, adults mourning the loss of elderly parents, descriptions of the heat and filth and fear of the Superdome and the Convention Center.
Obama	0	There was an overriding sense of relief, for the officials in Houston have done an outstanding job of creating a clean and stable place for these families in the short-term.
Obama	0	But a conversation I had with one woman captured the realities that are settling into these families as they face the future.
Obama	0	She told me "We had nothing before the hurricane.
Obama	0	Now we got less than nothing."
Obama	0	We had nothing before the hurricane.
Obama	0	Now we got less than nothing.
Obama	0	In the coming weeks, as the images of the immediate crisis fade and this chamber becomes consumed with other matters, we will be hearing a lot about lessons learned and steps to be taken.
Obama	0	I will be among those voices calling for action.
Obama	0	In the most immediate term, we will have to assure that the efforts at evacuating families from the affected states proceeds - that these Americans are fed, clothed, housed, and provided with the immediate care and medicine that they need.
Obama	0	We're going to have to make sure that we cut through red tape.
Obama	0	I can say from personal experience how frustrating, how unconscionable it is, that it has been so difficult to get medical supplies to those in need quickly enough.
Obama	0	We should make certain that any impediments that may continue to exist in preventing relief efforts from moving rapidly are eliminated.
Obama	0	Once we stabilize the situation, this country will face an enormous challenge in providing stability for displaced families over the months and years that it will take to rebuild.
Obama	0	Already, the state of Illinois has committed to accepting 10,000 families that are displaced.
Obama	0	There are stories in Illinois as there are everywhere of churches, mosques, synagogues and individual families welcoming people with open arms and no strings attached.
Obama	0	Indeed, if there's any bright light that has come out of this disaster, it's the degree to which ordinary Americans have responded with speed and determination even as their government has responded with unconscionable ineptitude.
Obama	0	Which brings me to the next point.
Obama	0	Once the situation is stable, once families are settled - at least for the short term - once children are reunited with their parents and enrolled in schools and the wounds have healed, we're gonna have to do some hard thinking about how we could have failed our fellow citizens so badly, and how we will prevent such a failure from ever occurring again.
Obama	0	It is not politics to insist that we have an independent commission to examine these issues.
Obama	0	Indeed, one of the heartening things about this crisis has been the degree to which the outrage has come from across the political spectrum; across races; across incomes.
Obama	0	The degree to which the American people sense that we can and must do better, and a recognition that if we cannot cope with a crisis that has been predicted for decades - a crisis in which we're given four or five days notice - how can we ever hope to respond to a serious terrorist attack in a major American city in which there is no notice, and in which the death toll and panic and disruptions may be far greater?
Obama	0	Which brings me to my final point.
Obama	0	There's been much attention in the press about the fact that those who were left behind in New Orleans were disproportionately poor and African American.
Obama	0	I've said publicly that I do not subscribe to the notion that the painfully slow response of FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security was racially-based.
Obama	0	The ineptitude was colorblind.
Obama	0	But what must be said is that whoever was in charge of planning and preparing for the worst case scenario appeared to assume that every American has the capacity to load up their family in an SUV, fill it up with $100 worth of gasoline, stick some bottled water in the trunk, and use a credit card to check in to a hotel on safe ground.
Obama	0	I see no evidence of active malice, but I see a continuation of passive indifference on the part of our government towards the least of these.
Obama	0	And so I hope that out of this crisis we all begin to reflect - Democrat and Republican - on not only our individual responsibilities to ourselves and our families, but to our mutual responsibilities to our fellow Americans.
Obama	0	I hope we realize that the people of New Orleans weren't just abandoned during the Hurricane.
Obama	0	They were abandoned long ago - to murder and mayhem in their streets; to substandard schools; to dilapidated housing; to inadequate health care; to a pervasive sense of hopelessness.
Obama	0	That is the deeper shame of this past week - that it has taken a crisis like this one to awaken us to the great divide that continues to fester in our midst.
Obama	0	That's what all Americans are truly ashamed about, and the fact that we're ashamed about it is a good sign.
Obama	0	The fact that all of us - black, white, rich, poor, Republican, Democrat - don't like to see such a reflection of this country we love, tells me that the American people have better instincts and a broader heart than our current politics would indicate.
Obama	0	We had nothing before the Hurricane.
Obama	0	Now we have even less.
Obama	0	I hope that we all take the time to ponder the truth of that message.
Obama	0	AFL-CIO NATIONAL CONVENTION  TOPIC: Economy & Labor July 25, 2005 AFL-CIO National Convention Chicago, Illinois Compete Text Thank you, and welcome to Chicago.
Obama	0	It would be naive of me to start without acknowledging what's been on everyone's mind during this convention.
Obama	0	As America tries to find its way in a global economy, we meet here at a challenging time for the labor movement.
Obama	0	There are questions of strategy and tactics, leadership and power.
Obama	0	And I can imagine that many of you are anxious not only about labor's future, but yours.
Obama	0	You're wondering, will I be able to leave my children a better world than I was given?
Obama	0	Will I be able to save enough to send them to college or plan for a secure retirement?
Obama	0	Will my job even be there tomorrow?
Obama	0	Who will stand up for me in this new world?
Obama	0	In this time of change and uncertainty, these questions are expected - but they are by no means unique.
Obama	0	From the earliest days of our founding, they have been asked and then answered by Americans who have stood in your shoes and shared your concerns about the future.
Obama	0	At the heyday of the Industrial Revolution, millions from around the world flocked to this very city in search of opportunity.
Obama	0	Immigrants from Europe, African-Americans from the Jim Crow South, and ethnic groups from every corner of America made their home in these neighborhoods and a living from the mills and factories that crowded a bustling Chicago.
Obama	0	The work was brutal and the pay was low, but none more so than on the South Side between Halsted and Ashland Avenue, where you could smell the stench of the meatpacking stockyards from miles away.
Obama	0	50,000 worked in what Upton Sinclair would later call "The Jungle," under some of the most dangerous and oppressive conditions in America.
Obama	0	Twice the workers tried to organize, and twice they were ferociously beaten back by employers willing to use violence, race-baiting, and starvation in order to keep wages at 32 cents an hour.
Obama	0	But these workers made a choice - a choice that this would not be their future.
Obama	0	And so in 1937, as the CIO begin organizing mass industries all across America, meatpacking workers began to follow their lead.
Obama	0	Imagine - these people would slave away in these plants all day long, freezing in the winter and sweltering in the summer, watching coworkers get their bones crushed in machines and friends get fired for even uttering the word "union" - and yet after they punched their card at the end of the day, they organized.
Obama	0	They went to meetings and they passed out leaflets.
Obama	0	They put aside decades of ethnic and racial tension and elected women, African Americans, and immigrants to leadership positions so that they could speak with one voice.
Obama	0	They could have accepted their lot in life or waited for someone else to save them.
Obama	0	Through their actions they risked life and living.
Obama	0	They chose to act.
Obama	0	In time, they won.
Obama	0	It started with victories as small as putting fans on the factory floor, and ended with paid holidays, and wage increases, and a seniority system, and pensions.
Obama	0	It started with hope, and it ended with the fulfillment of a long-held ideal.
Obama	0	A humble band of laborers against an industrial giant - an unlikely triumph against the greatest odds - a story as American as any.
Obama	0	For this has always been the way with us - at the edge of despair, in the shadow of hopelessness, ordinary people make the extraordinary decision that if we stand together, we rise together.
Obama	0	And we do.
Obama	0	At the end of the Civil War, when farmers and their families began moving into the cities to work in the big factories that were sprouting up all across America, we had to decide: Do we do nothing and allow the captains of industry and robber barons to run roughshod over the economy and workers by competing to see who can pay the lowest wage at the worst working conditions?
Obama	0	Or do we try to make the system work by setting up basic rules for the market, and instituting the first public schools, and busting up monopolies, and fighting so that working people could organize into unions?
Obama	0	Through strikes and sit-ins, petitions and rallies, and leaders who kept opportunity alive, we chose to act, and we rose together.
Obama	0	Years later, when the irrational exuberance of the Roaring Twenties came crashing down with the stock market, we had to decide: do we follow the call of leaders who would do nothing, or the call of a leader who, perhaps because of his physical paralysis, refused to accept political paralysis?
Obama	0	From Roosevelt's decision that political freedom would mean nothing without economic freedom to labor's tireless fight for that same principle, we chose to act - regulating the market, putting people back to work, expanding bargaining rights to include health care and a secure retirement - and together we rose.
Obama	0	Today, we face a challenge and a choice once more.
Obama	0	Too many of you have seen this challenge up close - when you drive by the old factory around lunchtime and no one walks out anymore.
Obama	0	When you can't get that raise or that health care plan you hoped for because your employer is competing with companies who pay foreign workers a fraction of what you make.
Obama	0	I saw it during the campaign when I met the union guys who use to work at the Maytag plant down in Galesburg and now wonder what they're gonna do at 55-years-old without a pension or health care; when I met the man who's son needs a new liver but doesn't know if he can afford when the kid gets to the top of the transplant list.
Obama	0	It's as if someone changed the rules in the middle of the game and no one bothered to tell them.
Obama	0	But as we all know, the rules have changed.
Obama	0	It started with technology and automation that rendered entire occupations obsolete.
Obama	0	Then companies were able to pick up and move their factories to the developing world, where workers are a lot cheaper than they are in the U.S. Now, advances in technology and communication mean that businesses not only have the ability to move jobs wherever there's a factory, but wherever there's an internet connection.
Obama	0	These changes have transformed the American worker into a kind of global free agent - if you can learn the right skills and get a great education, you can out-compete any worker in the world for the high-paying jobs of tomorrow.
Obama	0	But it also means that the days of lifetime employment at a company that provided wages, health care, and pensions you can bargain for are coming to an end.
Obama	0	At time of such insecurity and vulnerability, there has never been a greater need for a strong labor movement to stand up for American workers.
Obama	0	But the question we need to answer is: how will this movement and our people win in this new global economy?
Obama	0	Once again, we face a choice.
Obama	0	We know that globalization is not just another issue you can be for or against - it's here to stay.
Obama	0	And so the question is not whether we can stop it, but how we respond to it.
Obama	0	Some answers are clear.
Obama	0	When you have an administration that says "no" to a labor-friendly labor board, "no" to organizing rights, "no" to overtime pay, and "no" to a higher minimum wage, you say "no" to that administration and put someone else in office.
Obama	0	The Bush Administration's philosophy says we can't do much about the new challenges we face as a nation.
Obama	0	And since there is not much to do about global competition, the best that can be done is to give everyone one big refund on their government - divvy it up into individual portions, hand it out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy their own health care, their own retirement plan, their own child care, education, and so forth.
Obama	0	In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society.
Obama	0	But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism, every man and woman for him or herself.
Obama	0	It's a tempting idea, because it doesn't require much thought or ingenuity.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - tough luck.
Obama	0	It allows us to say to the factory workers who have lost their job - life isn't fair.
Obama	0	It let's us say to the child born into poverty - pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
Obama	0	But there is a problem.
Obama	0	It won't work.
Obama	0	It ignores our history.
Obama	0	It ignores the fact that it has been government research and investment that made the railways and the internet possible.
Obama	0	It has been the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefits and public schools - that has allowed all of us to prosper.
Obama	0	It has been the ability of working men and women to join together in unions and demand justice and opportunity that has kept America upwardly mobile.
Obama	0	Our economic dominance has always depended on individual initiative and belief in the free market, it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
Obama	0	So part of the fight is political - and part of the solution is to strengthen the right to organize across all industries and professions.
Obama	0	But it's not enough just to say "no" to Bush.
Obama	0	They may not have helped, and they may have made things worse, but they did not cause globalization.
Obama	0	And no matter what comes out of this convention, the labor movement must squarely confront the fact that the economy is changing.
Obama	0	The old ways of doing business are not working, and we must have a strategy that meets these new challenges.
Obama	0	I won't stand up here and say that coming up with this strategy will be easy, or pretend to know all the answers.
Obama	0	But part of the answer is recognizing that while unions and government can no longer provide this opportunity in the form of lifetime employment; they can ensure that every American worker has lifetime employability in this new economy.
Obama	0	That means fixing our schools to make sure every child in America has the education and the skills they need to compete - and that college is affordable for every American who wants to go.
Obama	0	And it means that unions can play a real role in finally creating a real system of lifelong learning so that workers who lose a job really can retrain for other high-wage jobs.
Obama	0	It means spurring job creation and innovation by investing our resources into research and development projects -- not cutting them.
Obama	0	It means investing in broadband and in medical technology; working with local communities to create centers of innovation.
Obama	0	It's time to fuel the genius and the innovation that will lead to the new jobs and new industries of the future.
Obama	0	Right now, all across America, there are amazing discoveries being made.
Obama	0	At Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University, researchers have developed a virtual algebra tutor that has helped inner-city kids in under-served schools raise their scores an entire letter grade.
Obama	0	In rural Virginia, telemedicine recently allowed a cardiologist 75 miles from the hospital to view an ultrasound and diagnose a congenital heart defect that required immediate medication, saving a young child's life.
Obama	0	And in the very cornfields of Illinois, farmers are literally growing the biofuels that could ultimately run our cars on 500 miles per gallon.
Obama	0	Breakthroughs like these won't just improve our lives, they'll create thousands of jobs that could be filled by American workers trained with new skills and a world-class education.
Obama	0	In this new economy, we should be able to tell workers that no matter where you work or how many times you switch jobs, you will have health care and a pension you can take with you always.
Obama	0	We'll never rise together if we allow medical bills to swallow family budgets or let people retire penniless after a lifetime of hard work, and so today we must demand that when it comes to commitments made to working men and women on health care and pensions, a promise made is a promise kept.
Obama	0	Our vision of America is not one where a big government runs our lives; it's one that gives every American the opportunity to make the most of their lives.
Obama	0	It's not one that tells us we're on our own, it's one that realizes that we rise or fall together as one people.
Obama	0	And yet, we also know that, in the end, neither policy nor politics can replace heart and courage in the struggle you now face.
Obama	0	Because in the brief history of the American experiment, it has been the ability of ordinary Americans to act on both that has allowed our nation to achieve extraordinary things.
Obama	0	It's why farmers put down their ploughs and picked up arms to overthrow an Empire for the sake of an idea.
Obama	0	It's why young men and women would take Freedom Rides down South to work for the Civil Rights movement.
Obama	0	And it's why workers would stand cold, hungry, and penniless on picket lines until their labor was treated with the dignity it deserved.
Obama	0	Almost a century earlier, during the struggle for the soul of Chicago's stockyards, Hank Johnson, a leading African-American union organizer, told a crowd of laborers that in the end, speeches don't make unions.
Obama	0	He said that "The real job of organizing has to be done everyday by the men and women who work right in the plant."
Obama	0	That's as true today as it was then - the real job of organizing working America - politics and policy, vision and mission, heart and soul - belongs to each of you.
Obama	0	And if you have the courage to succeed, labor will rise again.
Obama	0	America will rise again.
Obama	0	And hope will rise again.
Obama	0	Thank you and God Bless you.
Obama	0	FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS BILL AND THE AVIAN FLU    TOPICS: Foreign Policy & Defense and Healthcare & Health Issues July 18, 2005 Remarks of U.S.
Obama	0	Senator Barack Obama Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill and the Avian Flu Complete Text Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R.
Obama	0	2057, the Foreign Operations Appropriation Bill.
Obama	0	I'd also like to highlight one aspect of the bill.
Obama	0	Since coming to the Senate six months ago, one of the foreign policy and health issues I have focused on relates to the avian flu.
Obama	0	I am pleased that this bill includes $10 million to combat the spread of this potential pandemic, adding to the $25 million that the Senate provided in the supplemental appropriations bill in April.
Obama	0	I thank the managers of this bill, Senators McConnell and Leahy, and their staffs for working with me on this important issue.
Obama	0	I know that Senator McConnell has a longstanding interest in Southeast Asia, and Senator Leahy has always been a champion of international health issues, making the avian flu something I know they both care deeply about.
Obama	0	In the last few weeks, scientists have reported that a deadlier version of the avian flu has now spread to migrant birds that could carry the disease out of Asia and across the world.
Obama	0	While it may not seem that threatening to many Americans at first, this bird flu could easily transform into a human flu.
Obama	0	And if it does, it could be one of the deadliest flus mankind has ever known - even worse than the 1918 flu pandemic that killed 675,000 Americans and 50 million worldwide.
Obama	0	Already, there have been 108 human cases of avian flu, resulting in 54 deaths.
Obama	0	And while the virus has not yet mutated into a full-blown human flu, recent developments suggest it might be heading in that direction.
Obama	0	In recent months, the virus has been detected in mammals that have never previously been infected, including tigers, leopards and cats.
Obama	0	A few weeks ago, the World Health Organization reported that avian flu strains in Vietnam are lasting longer and spreading to more humans.
Obama	0	And according to government officials, a few cases of human-to-human spread have already occurred.
Obama	0	Every day, there are new reports about the increasing dangers of the avian flu.
Obama	0	Last month, it was revealed that Chinese farmers have tried to suppress outbreaks of the avian flu by using human antiviral drugs on infected animals.
Obama	0	As a result, one strain of the virus has become resistant to these drugs, thus making the drugs ineffective in protecting humans against a possible pandemic.
Obama	0	And just this week, researchers found that ducks infected with the virus were contagious for up to 17 days, causing the animals to become - in the researchers' words - "medical Trojan horses" for transmitting the disease to humans.
Obama	0	Simply put, the world is not ready for a potential outbreak of this deadly flu.
Obama	0	In fact, we aren't even close.
Obama	0	There is no known vaccine for the avian flu, and producing one could take months once an outbreak occurs.
Obama	0	And while the World Health Organization recommends that every nation stockpiles enough flu treatment to treat a quarter of its population, the United States has only ordered enough to treat less than 1% of ours.
Obama	0	We can't just stand by and hope that this virus doesn't reach our shores when it only takes hours to travel from one side of the world to the other.
Obama	0	It's time for America to lead the world in taking decisive action to prevent a potential global tragedy.
Obama	0	We should start by doing what we can to fight the virus while it's still mainly in Southeast Asia.
Obama	0	That's why I fought for and obtained $25 million for prevention efforts by the CDC, the Agency for International Development, the Health and Human Services Department, and other agencies.
Obama	0	And that's why I requested another $10 million in this bill.
Obama	0	In addition, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved language that I offered directing President Bush to form a senior-level task force to devise an international strategy to deal with the avian flu and coordinate policy among our government agencies.
Obama	0	I hope that the Bush administration forms this task force immediately without waiting for legislation to be passed.
Obama	0	Yet, these are only modest first steps.
Obama	0	International health experts believe that Southeast Asia will be an epicenter of influenza for decades.
Obama	0	That's why we need to create a permanent framework for curtailing the spread of future infectious diseases - a framework that would increase international disease surveillance, response capacity and public education and coordination, especially in Southeast Asia.
Obama	0	But we must also prepare our own country in the event that a global pandemic reaches America.
Obama	0	That's why I recently introduced the AVIAN Act, which helps make sure that Americans are protected from a possible outbreak of the avian flu.
Obama	0	When the threat is this real, we should be increasing research into possible flu vaccines, and we should be ordering enough doses of flu treatment to cover the recommended 25% of our population - just like England and other Western countries have done.
Obama	0	We should also ensure that our Health and Human Services department and state governments put in place a plan as to how they would address a potential flu pandemic, including the purchasing and distributing of vaccines.
Obama	0	A year after a draft of a federal plan was published, a final version has yet to be finalized.
Obama	0	We shouldn't have to wait any longer, because the avian flu certainly won't.
Obama	0	We are extremely fortunate that so far, the avian flu has not been found in the United States.
Obama	0	But in an age when you can board planes in Bangkok or Hong Kong and arrive in Chicago, Burlington or Louisville in hours, we must face the reality that these exotic killer diseases are not isolated health problems half a world away, but direct and immediate threats to security and prosperity here at home.
Obama	0	Again, I thank Senators McConnell and Leahy for including this important funding in the supplemental appropriations bill and now including additional funding in this bill.
Obama	0	And I thank the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Lugar, for his leadership on this issue I ask unanimous consent that several articles and editorials about the avian flu be included in the record.
Obama	0	Thank you, and I yield the floor.
Obama	0	AMERICAN LEGION CONFERENCE REMARKS  TOPIC: Veterans Saturday, July 16, 2005 American Legion Conference Remarks by Senator Barack Obama Springfield, Illinois Complete Text Thank you.
Obama	0	It's an honor to be here today with all of you Legionnaires.
Obama	0	Over the last few months and throughout the campaign, I've been able to travel the state and meet veterans from all across Illinois.
Obama	0	And no matter how many stories of heroism I hear, I constantly find myself in awe of your service and inspired by your sacrifice.
Obama	0	Oliver Wendell Holmes once said that "To fight out a war, you must believe something and want something with all your might."
Obama	0	In America, we must never forget how lucky we are to have so many men and women who believe - who are willing to put aside their own pursuit of happiness, to subordinate their own sense of survival, for something bigger - something greater.
Obama	0	When many of you joined the Armed Forces, you had your whole lives ahead of you - birthdays and weddings, holidays with family and friends, successes not yet achieved.
Obama	0	And yet, you were willing to leave all of that behind - perhaps forever - because you believed that your service would make it possible for the rest of us to live happily, safely, and freely.
Obama	0	And so it's this sense of obligation - of responsibility to one's fellow American - that we must honor when our veterans return and need our care and support.
Obama	0	Since I joined the Veterans Committee, I've heard a lot of debate over funding and budget numbers - about what we can afford and where we can save money.
Obama	0	But I know those aren't the first things that come to your mind when you think about taking care of America's veterans.
Obama	0	And they're not the first things that come to my mind either.
Obama	0	I think about my grandfather, who signed up for duty in World War II the day after Pearl Harbor.
Obama	0	He marched across Europe in Patton's army, and when he came home, it was the education and opportunity offered by the GI Bill that allowed his family to build their own American Dream.
Obama	0	I think about stories like the one I heard from a veteran named Bill Allen, who told me that on a trip to Chicago, he actually saw homeless veterans fighting over access to the dumpsters.
Obama	0	And I think about people like Seamus Ahern, who I met during the campaign at a V.F.W.
Obama	0	hall in East Moline.
Obama	0	He told me about how he'd joined the Marines because he was so proud of this country, and he felt that as a young person in his early twenties he wanted to give something back.
Obama	0	We became friends and we kept in touch over email while he was in Iraq.
Obama	0	One day he sent me one that said "I'm sorry I haven't written more often - I've been a little busy over here."
Obama	0	I had to tell him "Don't worry - I know you've got your hands full."
Obama	0	But as I listened to Seamus explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of us might hope for in a child.
Obama	0	And then I asked myself: When Seamus comes home, will we serve him as well as he served us?
Obama	0	That's the question we should be asking ourselves when we talk about veterans' benefits and the veterans' budget.
Obama	0	And that's the standard we should meet.
Obama	0	And so I ask: are we serving our veterans as well as they've served us when we find out that veterans' health care has been shortchanged by at least one billion dollars?
Obama	0	A shortfall that could have meant veterans turned away from doctor's visits, veterans unable to pay their medical bills, or veterans refused the prosthetics they need to live normal lives?
Obama	0	Thankfully, we restored the funding in Congress so that none of this would happen.
Obama	0	But let me be clear - the Department of Veterans Affairs should never be funded as an afterthought.
Obama	0	Republicans and Democrats warned the administration that there may be a shortfall months ago, and so we shouldn't have to be scraping for change now to care for those who risked their lives to defend ours.
Obama	0	It should be America's first priority.
Obama	0	And yet, you've all seen how we keep falling short.
Obama	0	How disabled veterans are waiting hundreds of days just to get their claim processed.
Obama	0	How wounded veterans in Illinois receive fewer disability benefits than those in New Mexico or Maine.
Obama	0	When I first arrived in the Senate, and saw the Chicago Sun-Times report that ranked Illinois 49th in how much disability pay our veterans received, we decided to hold town hall meetings here in Springfield and in Chicago to hear directly from you.
Obama	0	Well you spoke, we relayed your concerns to VA Secretary Nicholson, he came out to see the problem for himself, and now we've increased our VA staff by 27% so there are more caseworkers for each veteran.
Obama	0	But the benefits are still too low and the waits are still too long, and so we've got a ways to go.
Obama	0	It's not enough to simply wave a flag and welcome our veterans with words of praise - we need to get serious about solving these problems and honoring their service.
Obama	0	We held a hearing in Chicago about these issues just the other week, and I heard from a veteran whose hands had been crushed in an accident.
Obama	0	Twenty years later he's still caught in the VA bureaucracy, trying to obtain disability benefits.
Obama	0	Twenty years later.
Obama	0	Meanwhile, we just learned that the VA's latest solution on disability disparities is to stop ranking which states are the best and worst.
Obama	0	I don't know about you, but I don't think that burying bad news is any way deal with it.
Obama	0	If this is the best we can do for veterans who've already come home, what will we do for the hundreds of thousands who will, God-willing, return from Iraq and Afghanistan?
Obama	0	Veterans already have difficulty accessing VA care, and none of us want those who are still fighting to be greeted by a system that tells them "Thanks for fighting for your country - now take a number."
Obama	0	We know that soldiers are already coming home with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and we know that a recent Army study showed that one in six soldiers in Iraq reported symptoms of major depression.
Obama	0	Some experts predict that more than 100,000 soldiers may need some kind of mental health treatment when they come home.
Obama	0	For tens of thousands of others, the wounds they suffered in battle will need care that could last a lifetime.
Obama	0	These brave men and women may not have survived earlier wars, but thanks to advances in technology, these young people not only have the chance to survive, but to live normal lives.
Obama	0	But it's up to us to provide the resources to make that a reality.
Obama	0	It is not only our patriotic duty to provide this care, it is our moral duty at the most fundamental level - and we must rise to that challenge.
Obama	0	We've made some progress already.
Obama	0	In Congress, with the help of the American Legion, I worked to ensure that our hospitalized soldiers don't get billed for their meals.
Obama	0	And I've also sponsored the Sheltering All Veterans Everywhere Act, which would strengthen the VA programs our homeless vets need to get back on their feet.
Obama	0	The American Legion has endorsed this bill, and so I hope we can work together on this and other initiatives in the future.
Obama	0	Over half a century ago, it was American Legion National Commander Harry Colmery who first sat down and wrote the legislation that would become the GI Bill of Rights - a bill that has since provided education and training for nearly 8 million Americans, housing for nearly 2 million families, and led to the creation of the great American middle-class.
Obama	0	That was a bill that told our heroes "When you come home, we're here for you, because we're all in this together."
Obama	0	Today, we shouldn't be scraping to find the bare minimum in benefits and health care for our veterans.
Obama	0	And with the largest deployment of troops since Vietnam fighting for freedom in an increasingly dangerous world, we should be talking about a GI Bill for the 21st Century.
Obama	0	When veterans look to Congress for help, this is the kind of legislation they should hear about - not budget cuts and funding shortfalls.
Obama	0	It's time to reassess our priorities.
Obama	0	We never hesitate to praise the service of our veterans and acknowledge the debt we owe them for their service, but now we must renew our commitment to them by increasing funding for the VA, and ensure that our veterans receive more than just words of praise, but also the health care and benefits they've earned.
Obama	0	George Washington once said: "the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by our nation."
Obama	0	Washington understood then what every veteran here knows now - that when we make the decision to send our troops to war, we also make the decision to care for them, to speak for them, and to think of them - always - when they come.
Obama	0	Thank you and God Bless you.
Obama	0	LITERACY AND EDUCATION IN A 21ST-CENTURY ECONOMY  TOPIC: Education Saturday, June 25th, 2005 "Literacy and Education in a 21st-Century Economy" Complete Text  Thank you.
Obama	0	It's an honor to be here with the hundreds of dedicated librarians who make up the American Library Association.
Obama	0	Before we begin, I'd like to say a special hello to ALA member Nancy Gibbs, who is the mother of my communications director, Robert Gibbs.
Obama	0	Believe me, I have no idea how the biggest mouth in our office came from a family of two librarians, but we're proud to have him on board and I'm sure you are too.
Obama	0	I'd also like to give a shout-out to my librarians from the Punahou School in Hawaii - Molly Lyman, Joan Kaaua, and Lillian Hiratani.
Obama	0	I'd like to offer them an apology too, for all those times I couldn't keep myself out of trouble and ended up sitting in their library on a timeout, trying to cause even more trouble there.
Obama	0	Sorry ladies.
Obama	0	It is a pleasure to address you today because of what libraries represent.
Obama	0	More than a building that houses books and data, the library has always been a window to a larger world - a place where we've always come to discover big ideas and profound concepts that help move the American story forward.
Obama	0	And at a time when truth and science are constantly being challenged by political agendas and ideologies; a time where so many refuse to teach evolution in our schools, where fake science is used to beat back attempts to curb global warming or fund life-saving research; libraries remind us that truth isn't about who yells the loudest, but who has the right information.
Obama	0	Because even as we're the most religious of people, America's innovative genius has always been preserved because we also have a deep faith in facts.
Obama	0	And so the moment we persuade a child, any child, to cross that threshold into a library, we've changed their lives forever, and for the better.
Obama	0	This is an enormous force for good.
Obama	0	So I'm here to gratefully acknowledge the importance of libraries and the work you do.
Obama	0	I also want to work with you to insure that libraries continue to be sanctuaries for learning, where we are free to read and consider what we please, without the fear of Big Brother peering menacingly over our shoulders.
Obama	0	Now, some of you might have heard about this speech I gave at the Democratic Convention last summer.
Obama	0	It ended up making some news here and there, and one of the lines that people seem to remember was when I said that "We don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States."
Obama	0	What many people don't remember is that for years, librarians are the ones who've been on the frontlines of this fight for privacy and freedom.
Obama	0	There have always been dark times in our history where America has strayed from the ideals that make us a great nation.
Obama	0	But the question has always been, can we overcome?
Obama	0	And you have always been a group of Americans who have answered a resounding "yes" to that question.
Obama	0	When political groups try to censor great works of literature, you're the ones putting Huck Finn and Catcher in the Rye back on the shelves, making sure that our right to free thought and free information is protected.
Obama	0	And ever since we've had to worry about our own government looking over our shoulders in the library, you've been there to stand up and speak out on privacy issues.
Obama	0	You're full-time defenders of the most fundamental American liberties, and for that, you deserve America's deepest gratitude.
Obama	0	You also deserve our protection.
Obama	0	That's why I've been working with Republicans and Democrats to make sure we have a Patriot Act that helps us track down terrorists without trampling on our civil liberties.
Obama	0	This is an issue that Washington always tries to make "either-or."
Obama	0	Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles.
Obama	0	But this kind of choice asks too little of us and assumes too little about America.
Obama	0	We can harness new technologies and a new toughness to find terrorists before they strike while still protecting the very freedoms we're fighting for in the first place.
Obama	0	I know that some of you here have been subject to FBI or other law enforcement orders asking for reading records.
Obama	0	And so I hope we can pass a provision like the House of Representatives did that would require federal agents to get these kinds of search warrants from a real judge in a real court, just like everyone else does.
Obama	0	In the Senate, the bipartisan bill that we're working on, known as the SAFE Act, will prevent the federal government from freely rifling through emails and library records without first obtaining such a warrant.
Obama	0	Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activity is one thing; but doing it without the approval of our judicial system seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for.
Obama	0	Now, in addition to the line about federal agents poking around in our libraries, there was also another line in the convention speech that received a lot of attention - a line I'd like to talk more about today.
Obama	0	At one point in the speech, I mentioned that the people I've met all across Illinois know that government can't solve all their problems.
Obama	0	They know that, quote, "...parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white."
Obama	0	I included this line in the speech because I believe that we have a serious challenge to meet.
Obama	0	I believe that if we want to give our children the best possible chance in life; if we want to open doors of opportunity while they're young and teach them the skills they'll need to succeed later on, then one of our greatest responsibilities as citizens, as educators, and as parents is to ensure that every American child can read and read well.
Obama	0	This isn't just another education debate where the answer lies somewhere between more money and less bureaucracy.
Obama	0	It's a responsibility that begins at home - one that we need to take on before our kids ever step foot in a classroom; one that we need to carry through well into their teenage years.
Obama	0	That's because literacy is the most basic currency of the knowledge economy we're living in today.
Obama	0	Only a few generations ago, it was okay to enter the workforce as a high school dropout who could only read at a third-grade level.
Obama	0	Whether it was on a farm or in a factory, you could still hope to find a job that would allow you to pay the bills and raise your family.
Obama	0	But that economy is long gone.
Obama	0	As revolutions in technology and communication began breaking down barriers between countries and connecting people all over the world, new jobs and industries that require more skill and knowledge have come to dominate the economy.
Obama	0	Whether it's software design or computer engineering or financial analysis, corporations can locate these jobs anywhere there's an internet connection.
Obama	0	And so as countries like China and India continue to modernize their economies and educate their children longer and better, the competition American workers face will grow more intense; the necessary skills more demanding.
Obama	0	These new jobs are about what you know and how fast you can learn what you don't know.
Obama	0	They require innovative thinking, detailed comprehension, and superior communication.
Obama	0	But before our children can even walk into an interview for one of these jobs; before they can ever fill out an application or earn the required college degree; they have to be able to pick up a book, read it, and understand it.
Obama	0	Nothing is more basic; no ability more fundamental.
Obama	0	Reading is the gateway skill that makes all other learning possible, from complex word problems and the meaning of our history to scientific discovery and technological proficiency.
Obama	0	In a knowledge economy where this kind of learning is necessary for survival, how can we send our kids out into the world if they're only reading at a fourth grade level?
Obama	0	I don't know, but we do.
Obama	0	Day after day, year after year.
Obama	0	Right now, one out of every five adults in the United States can't read a simple story to their child.
Obama	0	During the last twenty years or so, over ten million Americans reached the 12th grade without having learned to read at a basic level.
Obama	0	But these literacy problems start far before high school.
Obama	0	In 2000, only 32% of all fourth graders tested as reading proficient.
Obama	0	And the story gets worse when you take race and income into consideration.
Obama	0	Children from low-income families score 27 points below the average reading level, while students from wealthy families score fifteen points above the average.
Obama	0	And while only one in twelve white seventeen-year-olds has the ability to pick up the newspaper and understand the science section, for Hispanics the number jumps to one in fifty; for African Americans it's one in one hundred.
Obama	0	In this new economy, teaching our kids just enough so that they can get through Dick and Jane isn't going to cut it.
Obama	0	Over the last ten years, the average literacy required for all American occupations is projected to rise by 14%.
Obama	0	It's not enough just to recognize the words on the page anymore - the kind of literacy necessary for 21st century employment requires detailed understanding and complex comprehension.
Obama	0	But too many kids simply aren't learning at that level.
Obama	0	And yet, every year we pass more of these kids through school or watch as more dropout.
Obama	0	These kids who will pour through the Help Wanted section and cross off job and after job that requires skills they just don't have.
Obama	0	And others who will have to take that Help Wanted section, walk it over to someone else, and find the courage to ask, "Will you read this for me?"
Obama	0	We have to change our whole mindset in this country.
Obama	0	We're living in a 21st century knowledge economy, but our schools, our homes, and our culture are still based around 20th century expectations.
Obama	0	It might seem like we're doing kids a favor by teaching them just enough to count change and read a food label, but in this economy, it's doing them a huge disservice.
Obama	0	Instead, we need to start setting high standards and inspirational examples for our children to follow.
Obama	0	While there's plenty that can be done to improve our schools and reform education in America, this isn't just an issue where we can turn to the government and ask for help.
Obama	0	Reading has to begin at home.
Obama	0	We know that children who start Kindergarten with an awareness of letters and basic language sounds become better readers and face fewer challenges in the years ahead.
Obama	0	We also know that the more reading material kids are exposed to at home, the better they score on reading tests throughout their lives.
Obama	0	So we need to make investments in family literacy programs and early childhood education so that kids aren't left behind before they even go to school.
Obama	0	And we need to get books in our kids' hands early and often.
Obama	0	I know that this is often easier said than done.
Obama	0	Parents today still have the toughest job in the world - and no one ever thanks you enough for doing it.
Obama	0	You're working longer and harder than ever, juggling job and family responsibilities, and trying to be everywhere at once.
Obama	0	When you're home, you might try to get your kids to read, but you're competing with the other byproducts of the technological revolution: video games and DVDs that they just have to have; TVs in every room of the household.
Obama	0	Children eight to eighteen now spend three hours a day watching TV, while they only spend 43 minutes reading.
Obama	0	Our kids aren't just seeing these temptations at home - they're everywhere.
Obama	0	Whether it's their friends or the people they see on TV or a general culture that glorifies anti-intellectualism, it's too easy for kids today to put down a book and turn their attention elsewhere.
Obama	0	And it's too easy for the rest of us to make excuses for it - pretending that putting a baby in front of a DVD is educational, letting a twelve-year-old skip reading as long as he's playing good video games, or substituting dinner in front of the TV for family conversation.
Obama	0	We know that's not what our kids need.
Obama	0	We know that's not what's best for them.
Obama	0	And so as parents, we need to find the time and the energy to step in and find ways to help our kids love reading.
Obama	0	We can read to them, talk to them about what they're reading and make time for this by turning off the TV ourselves.
Obama	0	Libraries can help parents with this.
Obama	0	Knowing the constraints we face from busy schedules and a TV culture, we need to think outside the box here - to dream big like we always have in America.
Obama	0	Right now, children come home from their first doctor's appointment with an extra bottle of formula.
Obama	0	But imagine if they came home with their first library card or their first copy of Goodnight Moon?
Obama	0	What if it was as easy to get a book as it is to rent a DVD or pick up McDonalds?
Obama	0	What if instead of a toy in every Happy Meal, there was a book?
Obama	0	What if there were portable libraries that rolled through parks and playgrounds like ice cream trucks?
Obama	0	Or kiosks in stores where you could borrow books?
Obama	0	What if during the summer, when kids often lose much of the reading progress they've made during the year, every child had a list of books they had to read and talk about and an invitation to a summer reading club at the local library?
Obama	0	Libraries have a special role to play in our knowledge economy.
Obama	0	Your institution has been and should be the place where parents and kids come to read together and learn together.
Obama	0	We should take our kids here more, and we should make sure politicians aren't closing libraries down because they had to spend a few extra bucks on tax cuts instead.
Obama	0	Each of you has a role here too.
Obama	0	You can get more kids to walk through your doors by building on the ideas so many of you are already pursuing - book clubs and contests, homework help and advertising your services throughout the community.
Obama	0	In the years ahead, this is our challenge - and this must be our responsibility.
Obama	0	As a librarian or as a parent, every one of you here today can probably remember the look on a child's face after finishing a first book.
Obama	0	They turn that last page and stare up at you with those wide eyes, and in that look you find such a sense of accomplishment and pride; of great potential and so much possibility.
Obama	0	And in that moment, there's nothing we want more than to nurture that hope; to make all those possibilities and all those opportunities real for our children; to have the ability to answer the question, "What can I be when I grow up?"
Obama	0	with "Anything you want - anything you can dream of."
Obama	0	It's a hope that's as old as the American story itself.
Obama	0	From the moment the first immigrants arrived on these shores, generations of parents have worked hard and sacrificed whatever is necessary so that their children could have the same chances they had; or the chances they never had.
Obama	0	Because while we could never ensure that our children would be rich or successful; while we could never be positive that they would do better than their parents, America is about making it possible to give them the chance.
Obama	0	To give every child the opportunity to try.
Obama	0	Education is still the foundation of this opportunity.
Obama	0	And the most basic building block that holds that foundation together is still reading.
Obama	0	At the dawn of the 21st century, in a world where knowledge truly is power and literacy is the skill that unlocks the gates of opportunity and success, we all have a responsibility as parents and librarians, educators and citizens, to instill in our children a love of reading so that we can give them the chance to fulfill their dreams.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	PRITZKER SCHOOL OF MEDICINE COMMENCEMENT  TOPICS: Commencement & Health/Healthcare Issues Friday, June 10th 2005 Pritzker School of Medicine Commencement Chicago, Illinois Complete Text Congratulations!
Obama	0	After four long years of endless studying, sleepless nights, and constant stress, who's ready to kick back, relax, and jump head first into their residency?
Obama	0	And who wishes people would stop making that joke?
Obama	0	I thought so.
Obama	0	It's an honor to be back here at the University of Chicago.
Obama	0	As most of you know, I used to teach over at the law school and my wife Michelle is in charge of community affairs at the hospital, so as a part of the family we're especially proud of you all right now.
Obama	0	We're also especially hopeful.
Obama	0	With the caliber of talent and amazing dedication represented here today, I found myself thinking that in one of these chairs could sit the researcher who will finally win humanity's long battle against cancer.
Obama	0	In one of these chairs could sit the scientist who transforms AIDS from one of the greatest disasters of the 20th century to one of the most curable diseases of the 21st.
Obama	0	In one of these chairs could sit the doctor who says "Hey Barack, don't worry about that trick knee - you're just getting old."
Obama	0	So that's hopeful too.
Obama	0	But this hope that I have for your class - this faith in our ability to overcome that which threatens to halt the march of human progress - is nothing new.
Obama	0	It is as old as our history and as powerful as the idea of America itself.
Obama	0	And that's because we've been here before.
Obama	0	Almost eighty years ago, when the University of Chicago's first graduating class sat here ready to collect their diplomas, who would have dared to believe that before the beginning of the next century, we would add thirty years to the average lifespan and witness a 90% drop in the rate of infant death?
Obama	0	Who would have dared to believe that with a simple vaccine, we could eliminate a disease that left millions without the ability to walk?
Obama	0	That we could transplant a heart or resuscitate one that stopped?
Obama	0	That we could unlock the greatest mysteries of life from the most basic building blocks of our existence?
Obama	0	In a time where you were lucky to live past fifty and doomed if you came down with the flu, who would have dared to believe these things?
Obama	0	The people who once sat in your chairs - they did.
Obama	0	The doctors and nurses, researchers and scientists who came before.
Obama	0	Who grew up believing that in America, the most improbable of all experiments, the place where we continue to defy the odds and write our own history, they could be the ones to improve, extend, and save human life.
Obama	0	They could be the healers.
Obama	0	As this new century unfolds, their success and your potential have led us to a moment of unparalleled promise in health and medicine.
Obama	0	Just like a century ago, technology and treatments that were once barely imagined are now imminently possible.
Obama	0	Yet, while these are some of tomorrow's biggest potential breakthroughs, they are not today's biggest medical challenge.
Obama	0	Today, as we continue to find new ways to live longer and better, the greatest single threat to the health of our nation is not a scarcity of genius or a failure of discovery; it is a lack of collective will to ensure that every single American has access to effective, affordable health care.
Obama	0	It is our inability, after years and years of talk and gridlock, to finally do something about the crushing cost of health care in America.
Obama	0	This has long stopped being about a single issue that politicians bring up during an election year.
Obama	0	This is now a national crisis.
Obama	0	45 million Americans are uninsured - over 5 million more in the last four years.
Obama	0	This isn't just a moral shame, it's an economic disaster that's catching Americans in a vicious cycle.
Obama	0	Because the uninsured can't afford health care, they put off seeing a doctor or end up in the ER when they get sick.
Obama	0	Then their care is more expensive, and so premiums for all Americans go up - to the tune of $922 a family.
Obama	0	Because everyone's premiums go up, more Americans lose their health care.
Obama	0	All the while, costs just keep climbing and climbing.
Obama	0	Family premiums are up by nearly 65% over the last five years.
Obama	0	Deductibles are up 50%.
Obama	0	Co-payments for care and prescriptions are through the roof.
Obama	0	From the smallest mom and pop stores to major corporations like GM, businesses who can't afford these rising costs cut back on insurance, workers, or both.
Obama	0	States with bigger Medicaid bills and smaller budgets are being forced to choose whether they want their citizens to be unhealthy or uneducated.
Obama	0	And over half of all family bankruptcies today are caused by medical bills.
Obama	0	The cost crisis is affecting your profession too.
Obama	0	Whether it's Medicaid reimbursements, the rising price of medical malpractice insurance, or having HMOs look over your shoulder, all the hard work and sacrifice you've put in during medical school isn't as rewarding as it once was.
Obama	0	So now, just like generations before, you must dare to believe - not only as tomorrow's physicians, but as tomorrow's parents, workers, business owners, and citizens.
Obama	0	You must choose: Will the groundbreaking miracles you discover over the next generation reach only the luckiest few?
Obama	0	Or will history look back at this moment as the time when we finally made care available at a cost that won't bring the world's largest economy to its knees?
Obama	0	For you guys, this is about more than just the statistics and the numbers.
Obama	0	Part of the philosophy of the Pritzker School of Medicine has always been the recognition that "medicine does not exist in a social vacuum."
Obama	0	Living here over the last four years, you've seen this.
Obama	0	Surrounding us right now on the south side of Chicago are poor kids sitting in those ERs who could never afford a physical.
Obama	0	Children suffering from adult diabetes because parents can't afford to provide the proper nutrition.
Obama	0	Worried mothers thumbing through checkbooks, not knowing if they can pay for this month's medicine.
Obama	0	There isn't one person sitting here today who wants to turn a sick patient away because they can't pay.
Obama	0	Not one person who wants the cure they discover denied to those whose lives depend on it.
Obama	0	Each of you has dedicated yourselves to this calling because where there is a sick person, you want to heal them.
Obama	0	Where there is a life in jeopardy, you want to save it.
Obama	0	And so today, when you leave here, it will not only be with great knowledge, but with even greater responsibility.
Obama	0	Because if we do nothing about the rising cost of health care, experts believe that in ten years, the number of uninsured will grow to 54 million.
Obama	0	And if we do nothing to expand access to the uninsured, costs will keep rising.
Obama	0	But while this is a national crisis, it still isn't part of the national conversation.
Obama	0	It's an issue where we haven't seen any leadership over the last four years; an issue that Washington continues to duck.
Obama	0	We just spent three entire weeks arguing over the filibuster, but I can count on one hand the number of times we've talked about health care since I was sworn in last January.
Obama	0	Yet, when I come back here and talk to families in Illinois, that's all they tell me about.
Obama	0	This isn't just limited to one party either.
Obama	0	In part, the fear of reform stems from the experience President Clinton had in the early '90s when he recognized the emerging health care crisis and sought a comprehensive answer.
Obama	0	For that, he deserves great credit.
Obama	0	But the resulting political firestorm, fanned by the insurance lobby and other powerful interests who had a stake in maintaining the status quo, badly singed the Clinton Administration.
Obama	0	Since then, health care continues to be fodder for candidates, but quickly recedes into the background when elections come and go.
Obama	0	And with each passing year, the problem grows and the solutions become more difficult.
Obama	0	We cannot turn our heads any longer.
Obama	0	Challenging as it is, fixing the health care system is not an impossible problem to solve.
Obama	0	I'm not saying it will be easy, or that all the solutions are right in front of us.
Obama	0	We may not be able to build consensus on every detail right away, but where we do agree, we should act now to bring down skyrocketing costs.
Obama	0	One place to start is by bringing the health care system into the 21st century.
Obama	0	In our lifetimes, we've seen some of the greatest advances in the history of technology and the sharing of information.
Obama	0	Yet, you're about to enter a profession where too much care is still provided with a pen and paper.
Obama	0	Where too much information about patients isn't shared between doctors or readily available to them in the first place.
Obama	0	And where we still don't have the information to know what care has worked most effectively and efficiently to make patients healthy.
Obama	0	For too many Americans, the time lost as a result of archaic record-keeping has been the margin between life and death.
Obama	0	But embracing 21st century technology is not just about reducing errors and improving the quality of medical care.
Obama	0	It's also about cost.
Obama	0	We spend nearly one and a half trillion dollars a year on health care in America.
Obama	0	But a quarter of that money - one out of every four dollars - is spent on non-medical costs; most of it bills and paperwork.
Obama	0	Nearly every other industry in the world has saved billions on these administrative costs by doing it all online.
Obama	0	Every transaction you make at a bank now costs them less than a penny.
Obama	0	Even at the Veterans Administration, where it used to cost nine dollars to pull up your medical record, new technology means you can call up the same record on the internet for free.
Obama	0	Yet, because we haven't updated technology in the rest of the health care industry, a single transaction still costs up to twenty-five dollars - not one dime of which goes toward improving the quality of our health care.
Obama	0	Doctors are forced to fumble through paperwork and don't have all of the information about each patient at the click of a mouse.
Obama	0	Mistakes are easily made and today, patients are given the right kind of care only half of the time.
Obama	0	In fact, a recent study showed that medical error alone kills up to 98,000 people a year - that's more than die from AIDS each year.
Obama	0	This is due not only to outdated medical technology, but the fact that we don't have a health care system that measures the quality of care patients are provided - that tells us what works, what doesn't, and where mistakes were made.
Obama	0	But by bringing our health care system on-line, we could start improving the quality of care and cutting the cost of it.
Obama	0	We could save thousands of lives and save families billions of dollars.
Obama	0	Just imagine if every doctor and nurse could sit by a patient's bedside with a laptop and pull up their entire medical history - information from every past doctor they've seen - with the click of a mouse.
Obama	0	If every patient had an electronic bracelet that you could scan to find out the exact type and amount of medication they needed so there were no mistakes made.
Obama	0	If you could go on-line and monitor a patient's breathing and heart rate while they were home to track their recovery.
Obama	0	We know all of this possible - so what are we waiting for?
Obama	0	It's time for this country to start taking on the big challenges and asking the big questions again.
Obama	0	Why couldn't we help every health care provider who does business with the federal government that they need to convert their entire system to electronic transactions?
Obama	0	Why couldn't we help connect our hospitals so they could share technology and information about what works and what doesn't?
Obama	0	This way we could start creating a virtual system of health care in America where knowledge about each individual's health needs and health history is readily available to every single person who provides them care.
Obama	0	And while we're at it, why couldn't we start rewarding the quality of care and the effort to prevent disease instead of only rewarding treatment itself?
Obama	0	This way there would be actual incentives to provide good care and it would cut down on wasteful spending on the wrong kind of care.
Obama	0	As tomorrow's doctors, you can help here too by making sure that all the drugs you prescribe aren't just the latest pharmaceutical fad, but the cheapest and most effective medicine for your patients.
Obama	0	So why couldn't we do all of this?
Obama	0	The answer is, we can.
Obama	0	We can bring down the cost of health care in America and insure every American, and your generation can lead the way.
Obama	0	Of course, no one's forcing you to meet these challenges.
Obama	0	Each of you has been blessed with extraordinary gifts and talent.
Obama	0	And so if you want, you can leave here and focus on your own medical career and your own success, not giving another thought to the plight of the growing millions who can't afford the care you will provide.
Obama	0	After all, there is no community service requirement in the real world; and no one's forcing you to care.
Obama	0	But I hope that you do.
Obama	0	Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.
Obama	0	Not because you have an obligation to those are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation.
Obama	0	You need to take on the challenges that your country is facing because you have an obligation to yourself.
Obama	0	Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation.
Obama	0	Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential.
Obama	0	Looking out at this class of 2005, I think my hope is well-placed.
Obama	0	With the field you have chosen, you've already shown how much you care about the lives of others; how strongly you have heard the calling to be healers in this world.
Obama	0	Today, I ask you to remember that call always, and to remember how it could include more than the patient sitting in your office.
Obama	0	It could also include the patients who can't afford to get there, the ones who aren't being provided the best care, and the general health of all Americans.
Obama	0	When you think about these challenges, I also ask you to remember that in this country, our history of overcoming the seemingly impossible always comes about because individuals who care really can make a difference.
Obama	0	America is great because Americans are good.
Obama	0	And as you go forth from here in your own life, you can keep this history alive if you only find the courage to try.
Obama	0	Good luck with this journey, and congratulations on all of your achievements.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	Nomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown  Nomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown - Complete Text TOPIC: Confirmations Wednesday, June 8, 2005 Nomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown Remarks Complete Text I rise today to speak on the nomination of California Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Obama	0	Now, let me begin by saying that the last thing I would like to be spending my time on right now is talking about judges.
Obama	0	I am sure that is true for many in this Chamber.
Obama	0	I know that I certainly do not hear about filibusters and judges when I go back to Illinois and hold townhall meetings with people across the State.
Obama	0	What I hear about are veterans who are concerned about their disability payments and families who are talking about how high gas prices were or how difficult it is to pay for college.
Obama	0	And so I think this argument we have been having over the last several weeks about judicial nominations has been an enormous distraction from some of the work that is most important to the American people.
Obama	0	Moreover, I am not so naive as to think that speaking to an empty Chamber for the benefit of C-SPAN is somehow going to change people's minds or people's votes.
Obama	0	I recognize that most of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, are fairly locked into their positions.
Obama	0	I do not expect the President to appoint many judges of my liking.
Obama	0	One of the things I have told some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle is that there is only one sure way to make sure Democrats are able to block what they consider to be bad judges, and that is to win elections.
Obama	0	And yet I feel compelled to rise on this issue to express, in the strongest terms, my opposition to the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the DC Circuit.
Obama	0	I think it is important for the American people to know just what it is we are getting.
Obama	0	After the Supreme Court, as my esteemed colleague from Wisconsin just stated, the DC Circuit is widely viewed as the second highest court in the land.
Obama	0	Three of our current Supreme Court Justices came directly from this court.
Obama	0	Under its jurisdiction fall laws relating to all sorts of Federal agencies and regulations.
Obama	0	This is a special court.
Obama	0	It has jurisdiction that other appeals courts do not have.
Obama	0	The judges on this court are entrusted with the power to make decisions affecting the health of the environment, the amount of money we allow in politics, the right of workers to bargain for fair wages and find freedom from discrimination, and the Social Security that our seniors will receive.
Obama	0	It is because of this power that we deserve to give the American people a qualified judicial nominee to serve on the DC Circuit.
Obama	0	Now, the test for a qualified judicial nominee is not simply whether they are intelligent.
Obama	0	Some of us who attended law school or are in business know there are a lot of real smart people out there whom you would not put in charge of stuff.
Obama	0	The test of whether a judge is qualified to be a judge is not their intelligence.
Obama	0	It is their judgment.
Obama	0	The test of a qualified judicial nominee is also not whether that person has their own political views.
Obama	0	Every jurist surely does.
Obama	0	The test is whether he or she can effectively subordinate their views in order to decide each case on the facts and the merits alone.
Obama	0	That is what keeps our judiciary independent in America.
Obama	0	That is what our Founders intended.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, as has been stated repeatedly on this floor, in almost every legal decision that she has made and every political speech that she has given, Justice Brown has shown she is not simply a judge with very strong political views, she is a political activist who happens to be a judge.
Obama	0	It is a pretty easy observation to make when you look at her judicial decisions.
Obama	0	While some judges tend to favor an activist interpretation of the law and others tend to believe in a restrained interpretation of the law providing great deference to the legislature, Justice Brown tends to favor whatever interpretation leads her to the very same ideological conclusions every single time.
Obama	0	So when it comes to laws protecting a woman's right to choose or a worker's right to organize, she will claim that the laws that the legislature passed should be interpreted narrowly.
Obama	0	Yet when it comes to laws protecting corporations and private property, she has decided that those laws should be interpreted broadly.
Obama	0	When the rights of the vulnerable are at stake, then she believes the majority has the right to do whatever it wants.
Obama	0	When the minority happens to be the minority of people who have privilege and wealth, then suddenly she is countermajoritarian and thinks it is very important to constrain the will of the majority.
Obama	0	Let me just give you a couple examples.
Obama	0	In a case reviewing California's parental notification law, Justice Brown criticized the California Supreme Court decision overturning that law, saying that the court should have remained "tentative, recognizing the primacy of legislative prerogatives."
Obama	0	She has also repeatedly tried to overturn the fact that California law recognizes Tameny claims, a line of cases that establishes that an employer does not have an unfettered right to fire an employee, but that the right has limits according to fundamental public policy.
Obama	0	She says judicial restraint is critical.
Obama	0	She claims that public policy is "a function first and foremost reserved to the legislature."
Obama	0	So on these cases dealing with a woman's right to choose, worker protections, punitive damages, or discrimination, she wants the judge to stay out of the legislative decisionmaking process.
Obama	0	But Justice Brown doesn't always want the courts to exercise restraint and defer to the legislature.
Obama	0	When Justice Brown wanted to limit the ability of juries to punish companies that engage in severe discrimination, a fellow judge on the California Supreme Court accused her of engaging in "judicial law making."
Obama	0	Instead of denying it, Justice Brown defended her judicial activism.
Obama	0	She called it creativity.
Obama	0	This is what she said: "All judges make law.
Obama	0	It is arrogance, carelessness and a lack of candor that constitute impermissible judicial practice, not creativity."
Obama	0	Justice Brown has also gone out of her way to use her position in the courts to advocate for increased protections for property owners.
Obama	0	In a case about a developer that wanted to break a city rent control law, Justice Brown dismissed the fact that a majority of the city's voters had approved of that law and thought that the case should be an exception to the philosophy of narrow judicial review.
Obama	0	Justice Brown believed that this case was one in which "some degree of judicial scrutiny... is appropriate."
Obama	0	Which is it, Justice Brown?
Obama	0	In some cases you think we should defer to the legislature and in some cases, apparently, you think it is appropriate for judges to make law.
Obama	0	What seems to distinguish these two types of cases is who the plaintiff is, who the claimant is.
Obama	0	If the claimant is powerful -- if they are a property owner, for example -- then she is willing to use any tool in her judicial arsenal to make sure the outcome is one they like.
Obama	0	If it is a worker or a minority claiming discrimination, then she is nowhere to be found.
Obama	0	Judicial decisions ultimately have to be based on evidence and on fact.
Obama	0	They have to be based on precedent and on law.
Obama	0	When you bend and twist all of these to cramp them into a conclusion you have already made -- a conclusion that is based on your own personal ideology -- you do a disservice to the ideal of an independent judiciary and to the American people who count on an independent judiciary.
Obama	0	Because of this tendency, and because of her record, it seems as if Justice Brown's mission is not blind justice but political activism.
Obama	0	The only thing that seems to be consistent about her overarching judicial philosophy in an unyielding belief in an unfettered free market and a willingness to consistently side with the powerful over the powerless.
Obama	0	Let's look at some of her speeches outside of the courtroom.
Obama	0	In speech after speech, she touts herself as a true conservative who believes that safety nets -- such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, and health care -- have "cut away the very foundation upon which the Constitution rests."
Obama	0	Justice Brown believes, as has already been stated in the Chamber, that the New Deal, which helped save our country and get it back on its feet after the Great Depression, was a triumph of our very own "Socialist revolution."
Obama	0	She has equated altruism with communism.
Obama	0	She equates even the most modest efforts to level life's playing field with somehow inhibiting our liberty.
Obama	0	For those who pay attention to legal argument, one of the things that is most troubling is Justice Brown's approval of the Lochner era of the Supreme Court.
Obama	0	In the Lochner case, and in a whole series of cases prior to Lochner being overturned, the Supreme Court consistently overturned basic measures like minimum wage laws, child labor safety laws, and rights to organize, deeming those laws as somehow violating a constitutional right to private property.
Obama	0	The basic argument in Lochner was you can't regulate the free market because it is going to constrain people's use of their private property.
Obama	0	Keep in mind that that same judicial philosophy was the underpinning of Dred Scott, the ruling that overturned the Missouri Compromise and said that it was unconstitutional to forbid slavery from being imported into the free States.
Obama	0	That same judicial philosophy essentially stopped every effort by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to overcome the enormous distress and suffering that occurred during the Great Depression.
Obama	0	It was ultimately overturned because Justices, such as Oliver Wendell Holmes, realized that if Supreme Court Justices can overturn any economic regulation -- Social Security, minimum wage, basic zoning laws, and so forth -- then they would be usurping the rights of a democratically constituted legislature.
Obama	0	Suddenly they would be elevated to the point where they were in charge as opposed to democracy being in charge.
Obama	0	Justice Brown, from her speeches, at least, seems to think overturning Lochner was a mistake.
Obama	0	She believes the Supreme Court should be able to overturn minimum wage laws.
Obama	0	She thinks we should live in a country where the Federal Government cannot enforce the most basic regulations of transparency in our security markets, that we cannot maintain regulations that ensure our food is safe and the drugs that are sold to us have been tested.
Obama	0	It means, according to Justice Brown, that local governments or municipalities cannot enforce basic zoning regulations that relieve traffic, no matter how much damage it may be doing a particular community.
Obama	0	What is most ironic about this is that what Justice Brown is calling for is precisely the type of judicial activism that conservatives have been railing against for the last 50 years.
Obama	0	Supreme Court Justice Scalia is not somebody with whom I frequently agree.
Obama	0	I do not like a lot of his judicial approaches, but at least the guy is consistent.
Obama	0	Justice Scalia says that, generally speaking, the legislature has the power to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution.
Obama	0	That is not Justice Brown's philosophy.
Obama	0	It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right to do what you want with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom.
Obama	0	Yet that seems to be the manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.
Obama	0	It would be one thing if these opinions were confined to her political speeches.
Obama	0	The fact is she has carried them over into her judicial decisionmaking.
Obama	0	That is why the California State Bar Association rated her as "unqualified" to serve on the State's highest court.
Obama	0	That is why not one member of the American Bar Association found her to be very qualified to serve on the DC Circuit, and why many members of the bar association found her not qualified at all.
Obama	0	It is also why conservative commentators, such as Andrew Sullivan and George Will, while agreeing with her political philosophy, simply do not see how she can be an effective judge.
Obama	0	Here is what Sullivan said: She does not fit the description of a judge who simply follows the law.
Obama	0	If she isn't a "judicial activist," I don't know who would be.
Obama	0	Sullivan added that he is in agreement with some of her conservative views but thinks "she should run for office, not the courts."
Obama	0	Columnist George Will, not known to be a raving liberal, added recently that he believes Justice Brown is out of the mainstream of conservative jurisprudence.
Obama	0	Let me wrap up by making mention of a subtext to this debate.
Obama	0	As was true with Clarence Thomas, as was true with Alberto Gonzales, as was true with Condoleezza Rice, my esteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent a lot of time during this debate discussing Justice Brown's humble beginnings as a child of a sharecropper.
Obama	0	They like to point out she was the first African American to serve on the California Supreme Court.
Obama	0	I, too, am an admirer of Justice Brown's rise from modest means, just as I am an admirer of Alberto Gonzales's rise from modest means, just as I am an admirer of Clarence Thomas's rise from modest means, just as I am an admirer of Condoleezza Rice's rise from modest means.
Obama	0	I think it is wonderful.
Obama	0	We should all be grateful where opportunity has opened the doors of success for Americans of every background.
Obama	0	Moreover, I am not somebody who subscribes to the view that because somebody is a member of a minority group they somehow have to subscribe to a particular ideology or a particular political party.
Obama	0	I think it is wonderful that Asian Americans, Latinos, African Americans, and others are represented in all parties and across the political spectrum.
Obama	0	When such representation exists, then those groups are less likely to be taken for granted by any political party.
Obama	0	I do not think that because Justice Brown is an African-American woman she has to adhere to a particular political orthodoxy, something that has been suggested by the other side of the aisle.
Obama	0	Just as it would be cynical and offensive that Justice Brown be vilified simply for being a Black conservative, it is equally offensive and cynical to suggest that somehow she should get a pass for her outlandish views simply because she is a Black woman.
Obama	0	I hope we have arrived at a point in our country's history where Black folks can be criticized for holding views that are out of the mainstream, just as Whites are criticized when they hold views that are out of the mainstream.
Obama	0	I hope we have come to the point where a woman can be criticized for being insensitive to the rights of women, just as men are criticized when they are insensitive to the rights of women.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, Justice Brown's record on privacy and employment discrimination indicates precisely such an insensitivity.
Obama	0	I will give one example.
Obama	0	In a case where a group of Latino employees at Avis Rent A Car was subjected to repeated racial slurs in the workplace by another employee, the lower court found that Avis, in allowing this to go on, had created a hostile environment.
Obama	0	Justice Brown disagreed with and criticized the decision.
Obama	0	In her opinion, she wrote that racially discriminatory speech in the workplace, even when it rises to the level of illegal race discrimination, is still protected by the first amendment.
Obama	0	This was despite U.S. Supreme Court opinions that came to the exact opposite conclusion.
Obama	0	Justice Brown went so far as to suggest that the landmark civil rights law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, could be unconstitutional under the first amendment.
Obama	0	I believe if the American people could truly see what was going on here they would oppose this nomination, not because she is African American, not because she is a woman, but because they fundamentally disagree with a version of America she is trying to create from her position on the bench.
Obama	0	It is social Darwinism, a view of America that says there is not a problem that cannot be solved by making sure that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
Obama	0	It requires no sacrifice on the part of those of us who have won life's lottery and does not consider who our parents were or the education received or the right breaks that came at the right time.
Obama	0	Today, at a time when American families are facing more risk and greater insecurity than they have in recent history, at a time when they have fewer resources and a weaker safety net to protect them against those insecurities, people of all backgrounds in America want a nation where we share life's risks and rewards with each other.
Obama	0	And when they make laws that will spread this opportunity to all who are willing to work for it, they expect our judges to uphold those laws, not tear them down because of their political predilections.
Obama	0	Republican, Democrat, or anyone in between.
Obama	0	Those are the types of judges the American people deserve.
Obama	0	Justice Brown is not one of those judges.
Obama	0	I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this nomination.
Obama	0	MEMORIAL DAY ABRAHAM LINCOLN NATIONAL CEMETERY  TOPIC: Our Past, Our Future & Vision for America Monday, May 30th, 2005 - Memorial Day Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery Elwood, Illinois Complete Text  Thank you for allowing me the honor of joining you here today.
Obama	0	This is my first time visiting the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, and as I was driving through I thought to myself that the staff and the volunteers who have made this possible should feel very proud of the work they're doing - this is a beautiful place for our veterans to come home to.
Obama	0	Among red maples and sturdy oaks, over 10,000 Americans now lay here, resting peacefully under an endless Illinois sky.
Obama	0	They rest in silence.
Obama	0	On a typical day, except for scattered footsteps or the soft gurgling of a stream, I imagine you could walk row after row of headstones without hearing a single sound.
Obama	0	It isn't until you come across another visitor - a widow watering the plant she brought for her husband; a little girl planting a flag at her father's headstone; a mother shedding tears on the wreath she will lay for her son - that you realize something: In this place we have come to associate with the quiet of death, the memories of loved ones speak to us so strongly that when we stop and listen, we can't help but hear life.
Obama	0	And once a year on this day, in the fullness of spring, in the presence of those who never really leave us, it is life that we honor.
Obama	0	Lives of courage, lives of sacrifice, and the ultimate measure of selflessness - lives that were given to save others.
Obama	0	What led these men and women to wear their country's uniform?
Obama	0	What is it that leads anyone to put aside their own pursuit of happiness; to subordinate their own sense of survival, for something larger - something greater?
Obama	0	Behind each stone is one of these stories; a personal journey that eventually led to the decision to fight for one's country and defend the freedoms we enjoy.
Obama	0	Most of the Americans who rest here were like my grandfather, a WWII vet who volunteered after Pearl Harbor, fought in Patton's Army, but was lucky enough to came back in one piece, and went on to live well into his twilight years.
Obama	0	My grandfather never boasted about it.
Obama	0	He treated the fact that he served in the military like it was only a matter of fact.
Obama	0	And so it is easy for us to forget sometimes that, like my grandfather, the men and women resting here, whose service spans a century of conflict from the Civil War to the War in Iraq, chose their path at a very young age.
Obama	0	These were kids who went to war.
Obama	0	They had a whole life ahead of them - birthdays and weddings, holidays with children and grandchildren, homes and jobs and happiness of their own.
Obama	0	And yet, at one moment or another, they felt the tug.
Obama	0	Maybe it was a President's call to save the Union and to free the slaves.
Obama	0	Maybe it was the day of infamy that awakened a nation to the dangers of Fascism.
Obama	0	Or maybe it was the morning we saw our security dissappear then the twin towers collapsed.
Obama	0	And at that moment, whatever the moment was, these men and women thought of a mom or a dad, a husband or a wife, or a child not yet born.
Obama	0	They thought of a landscape, or a way of life, or a flag, or the words of freedom they'd learned to love.
Obama	0	And they determined that it was time to go.
Obama	0	They decided: "I must serve so that the people I love may live - happily, safely, freely."
Obama	0	Oliver Wendell Holmes once remarked that "To fight out a war, you must believe something and want something with all your might."
Obama	0	The Americans who lay here believed.
Obama	0	And when they waved goodbye to their families - some for the last time - they held those beliefs close as they crossed the ocean towards an unknown destiny.
Obama	0	And they made us very proud.
Obama	0	No matter how many veterans you may meet, or how many stories of heroism you may hear, every encounter reminds you that through their service, these men and women have lived out the ideals that stir our Nation - honor, duty, sacrifice.
Obama	0	They're people like Seamus Ahern, who I met during the campaign at a V.F.W.
Obama	0	hall in East Moline, Illinois.
Obama	0	He told me about how he'd joined the Marines because his country had given so much to him, and he felt that as a young person he needed to give something back.
Obama	0	We became friends and we kept in touch over email while he was in Iraq.
Obama	0	One day he sent me an email that said "I'm sorry I haven't written more often - I've been a little busy over here in Falujah."
Obama	0	I had to reply "I don't think it's necessary to apologize."
Obama	0	They're people like Major Tammy Duckworth, a helicopter pilot with the Illinois Army Guard.
Obama	0	Four months ago, she lost both of her legs when a rocket was shot through the floor of her Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq.
Obama	0	And yet, last month she came to the United States Senate to testify about ways we can improve the process of rehabilitating injured vets, and as we speak she has already begun training so that she can fly again for her country one day.
Obama	0	They're the people I had the honor of meeting at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington.
Obama	0	Young men and women who may have lost limbs or broken their backs or severed their nerves, but have not lost the will to live, or the pride they feel in having served their country.
Obama	0	They have no time for self-pity, but wish only to recuperate as quickly as they can, and meet the next challenge.
Obama	0	It is this quintessentially American optimism that stands out in our veterans.
Obama	0	To meet these men and women gives you a clear sense of the quality of person we have serving in the United States Armed Forces.
Obama	0	No wonder, then, that when these men and women come home from war, they return to parades and salutes, the arms of loved ones and the waving flags of children.
Obama	0	But today, on Memorial Day, we also remember that some come home in a different way.
Obama	0	The news of their impending arrival is delivered with a soft knock on the door.
Obama	0	Their return comes with the sound of a twenty-one gun salute and the lonely notes of taps.
Obama	0	I won't pretend that simple words of condolence could ever ease the pain of the loss for the families they leave behind.
Obama	0	I am the father of two little girls, and when I see the parents who have come here today to lay wreaths for the children they lost, my heart breaks with theirs.
Obama	0	But I will say to those parents that here in Illinois and all across America, other children and other parents look to your children and their service as a shining example of what's best in this land.
Obama	0	During the Civil War, President Lincoln took a moment to sit down and personally write a condolence letter to a Mrs. Bixby of Massachusetts after he had learned that she lost five of her sons in battle.
Obama	0	In that letter, the President wrote: "I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom."
Obama	0	Here on this hallowed ground and in ceremonies across the nation, we choose this day to solemnly honor those costly sacrifices - sacrifices that were made on the fields of Gettysburg, the beaches of Normandy, the deserts of Iraq, and so many other distant lands.
Obama	0	It makes our hearts heavy; our heads bow in respect.
Obama	0	But amid the quiet of this spring day in Elwood, we also hear life.
Obama	0	And as we are called by the memories of those who found the courage to lay down a life so that others may live, we thank God for blessing us with the privilege of knowing such heroic sons and daughters of America.
Obama	0	AMERICA'S NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION POLICY   TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense May 26th, 2005 America's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy   Mr. President, throughout the last half of the 20th Century, one nation - more than any other on the face of the earth - defined and shaped the threats posed to the United States.
Obama	0	This nation, of course, is the Soviet Union and its successor state, Russia.
Obama	0	While many have turned their attention to China or other parts of the world, I believe that the most important threat to the security of the United States continues to lie within the borders of the former Soviet Union - in the form of stockpiles of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and materials.
Obama	0	We are in a race against time to prevent these weapons from getting in the hands of international terrorist organizations or rogue states.
Obama	0	And the path to this potential disaster is easier than anyone could imagine: there are a number of potential sources of fissile material in the former Soviet Union in sites that are poorly secured; the material is compact, easy to hide, and hard to track; and weapons designs can be found on the internet.
Obama	0	Today, some weapons experts believe that terrorist organizations will have enough fissile material to build a nuclear bomb in the next 10 years.
Obama	0	That's right - 10 years.
Obama	0	I rise today to instill a sense of urgency here in the Senate.
Obama	0	I rise today to ask how we are going to deal with this threat -- tomorrow; a year from now; and a decade from now.
Obama	0	The President has just completed an international trip that included a visit to Russia.
Obama	0	I want to commend the President for taking this trip and making our relationship with Russia a priority.
Obama	0	During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union produced nearly 2,000 tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for use in weapons that could destroy the world several times over.
Obama	0	To give you an idea of just how much this is, it takes only five to ten kilograms of plutonium to build a nuclear weapon that could kill the entire population of St. Louis.
Obama	0	For decades, strategic deterrence, our alliances, and the balance of power with the Soviet Union ensured the relative safety of these weapons and materials.
Obama	0	With the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, all of this changed.
Obama	0	Key institutions within the Soviet national security apparatus crumbled, exposing dangerous gaps in the security of nuclear weapons, delivery systems, and fissile material.
Obama	0	Regional powers felt fewer constraints to develop nuclear weapons.
Obama	0	Rogue states accelerated nuclear weapons programs.
Obama	0	And while this was happening, international terrorist organizations who were aggressively seeking nuclear weapons gained strength and momentum.
Obama	0	Thanks to the leadership of Senators Nunn and Lugar in creating the Cooperative Threat Reduction program at the Department of Defense, there is no question that we've made some great progress in securing these weapons.
Obama	0	These same leaders continue to work tirelessly on the problem to this day -- Senator Nunn through the Nuclear Threat Initiative and Senator Lugar through his Chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee.
Obama	0	And so today, the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union today is drastically different that it was in 1991 or even 1996 or 2001.
Obama	0	But the threat is still extremely dangerous and extremely real.
Obama	0	In March of this year, a senior Russian commander concluded that 39 of 46 key Russian weapons facilities had serious security shortcomings.
Obama	0	Many Russian nuclear research sites frequently have doors propped open, security sensors turned off, and guards patrolling without ammunition in their weapons.
Obama	0	Meanwhile, the fanatical terrorist organizations who want these weapons continue to search every corner of the Earth, resorting to virtually any means necessary.
Obama	0	The nuclear programs of nations such as Iran and North Korea threaten to destabilize key regions of the world.
Obama	0	And, we are still learning about the tremendous damage caused by A.Q.
Obama	0	Kahn, the rogue Pakistani weapons scientist.
Obama	0	Looking back over the past decade and a half, it is clear that we could and should have done more.
Obama	0	And so as the President returns from his trip to Russia, we should be thinking - on a bipartisan basis - about some of the critical issues that can guide us in the future to ensure that there are no more missed opportunities.
Obama	0	The situation is too dangerous.
Obama	0	The threat to our security too grave.
Obama	0	The first question that we should be thinking about is what is the future of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program?
Obama	0	Where do we go from here?
Obama	0	In other words, what is our plan?
Obama	0	I believe that the Administration must spend more time working with Congress to chart out a road map and strategic vision of the program.
Obama	0	There are two things that the President can do to move on this issue.
Obama	0	First, in the National Security Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction of 2002, the Administration said the National Security Council would prepare a 5 year government-wide strategy by March, 2003.
Obama	0	To my knowledge, this has not been completed.
Obama	0	In addition, Congress required the Administration to submit an inter-agency coordination plan on how to more effectively deal with non-proliferation issues.
Obama	0	This plan is due at the end of this month.
Obama	0	Completing these plans will help U.S. better address critical day-to-day issues, such as liability, resource allocation, and timetables.
Obama	0	Having a better strategic vision will also help us work more efficiently and effectively with other international donors, who have become increasingly involved and are making significant contributions to these efforts.
Obama	0	This is an important issue, as the contributions of other donors could help us make up valuable lost time.
Obama	0	Mr. President, the second set of questions I would like to raise concerns the U.S.-Russian relationship.
Obama	0	Where is this relationship heading?
Obama	0	Will Russia be an adversary?
Obama	0	A partner?
Obama	0	Or something in between?
Obama	0	I don't ask these questions simply because I am a nice guy and I want to get along with the Russians.
Obama	0	I ask these questions because they directly impact our progress towards securing and destroying stockpiles of nuclear weapons and materials.
Obama	0	In the last few years, we have seen some disturbing trends in Russia - the rapid deterioration of democracy and the rule of law; bizarre and troubling statements from President Putin about the fall of the Soviet Union; the abuses in Chechnya; and Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union from the Baltics to Ukraine to Georgia.
Obama	0	The Russians must understand that their actions on some of these issues are completely unacceptable.
Obama	0	At the same time, I believe that we have to do a better job of working with the Russians to make sure that they are moving in the right direction.
Obama	0	This starts by being thoughtful and consistent about what we say and what we do.
Obama	0	Tone is important here.
Obama	0	Some of the statements by our own officials have been confusing, contradictory, and problematic.
Obama	0	At times, I have been left scratching my head about what exactly is our policy and how Administration statements square with this policy.
Obama	0	Another issue is the level of sustained engagement with Russia.
Obama	0	I am glad that the President and Secretary of State have made a number of trips to Russia.
Obama	0	But, as these trips are but a few days every year or so, this is only one aspect of the relationship.
Obama	0	An additional part, which has suffered in recent years, is our foreign assistance programs to Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union.
Obama	0	These programs are an essential way for the United States to maintain our engagement with Russia.
Obama	0	They aren't just giveaways; they are programs that advance U.S. interests by strengthening democracy and civil society, enhancing economic development, and dealing with international health issues - in addition to curbing the nonproliferation threat.
Obama	0	At a time when these programs are desperately needed, their budgets have been cut dramatically.
Obama	0	At a time when we should be doing more to engage and shape the future of Russia, we seem to be doing the exact opposite.
Obama	0	The non-proliferation threat does not exist in a vacuum.
Obama	0	The issues I just mentioned -- along with other important issues such as our own strategic nuclear arsenal -- must also be considered as we move forward.
Obama	0	Finally, Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to consider how our relationship with Russia, and our efforts to secure and destroy weapons and materials inside the former Soviet Union, fits in with our broader non-proliferation goals.
Obama	0	Russia is a major player in the two of the biggest proliferation challenges we currently face - Iran and North Korea.
Obama	0	Russia's dangerous involvement with Iran's nuclear program has been well documented, and there is no question that their actions will be pivotal if the President is to successfully resolve this deteriorating situation.
Obama	0	The Russians are also an important voice in trying to make progress on the deteriorating situation in North Korea.
Obama	0	The Russian city of Vladivostok is home to 590,000 people and is very close to the North Korean border - putting the Russians smack in the middle of a crisis that we need to resolve.
Obama	0	In addition to all of this, Russia holds a veto on the UN Security Council, which could consider the Iranian and North Korean issues in the very near future.
Obama	0	Developing strong bilateral and multilateral strategies that deal with Russia's role in these growing crises will be extremely important, both in terms of resolving these crisis, advancing our non-proliferation goals within the former Soviet Union, and our long-term relationship with Russia.
Obama	0	I realize that right now, none of us have all the answers to these extraordinarily difficult questions.
Obama	0	But if we hope to successfully fight terror and avoid disaster before it arrives at our shores, we must start finding those answers.
Obama	0	We have work to do.
Obama	0	I believe that it is worth putting in place a process - one that involves senior Administration officials, a bipartisan group of Members of Congress as well as retired senior military officers and diplomats - in an effort to dramatically improve progress on these issues.
Obama	0	I am interested in hearing from the President about his trip.
Obama	0	I am also interested in hearing if he believes that an idea, similar to the one that I put forward, is worth considering.
Obama	0	Delay is not an option.
Obama	0	We need to start making more progress on this issue today.
Obama	0	I urge my colleagues to act.
Obama	0	ROCKFORD REGISTER STAR YOUNG AMERICAN AWARDS  TOPIC: Education and Technology May 7th, 2005 Rockford Register Star Young American Awards Complete Text  Thank you, and congratulations to all of this year's Young Americans.
Obama	0	Now that you've each received your award, I have one question for all of you: What are you going to do with it?
Obama	0	I know that after you wear it out of here, your parents will proudly hang it up somewhere in the house where everyone can see it.
Obama	0	And at some point you'll go off to college and, against our best wishes, probably find a way to use it to open certain beverages.
Obama	0	But my question is - what are you going to do with it?
Obama	0	What are you going to make of this honor and this recognition?
Obama	0	What will it mean in your lives?
Obama	0	The committee who gave you this award, your parents, all of us - we hope that it means you will go on to achieve great things, find immeasureable success, and discover the job of your dreams.
Obama	0	But we also hold another hope.
Obama	0	You're all sitting here because in each of you, someone saw a spark.
Obama	0	It's a spark that goes deeper than tests and grades, varsity letters and service awards.
Obama	0	It's the spark that keeps each of you asking the questions, what if, why, and why not?
Obama	0	The one that keeps you always searching for answers to those questions.
Obama	0	The one that makes you say, "I don't have to be content with the present, because I have a role in changing the future."
Obama	0	What each of you has is the desire to learn not just for the next test or even the next diploma, but to learn for the sake of learning.
Obama	0	To constantly look around your world and seek new ways to improve it.
Obama	0	To embrace change as the inevitable engine of progress.
Obama	0	At the dawn of the 21st century, when the world is changing faster than we could've ever imagined, this spark, this skill - lifelong learning - is the most important thing you can take with you when you graduate here.
Obama	0	Why, you're wondering.
Obama	0	What's he talking about?
Obama	0	Well, I'm talking about McDonald's.
Obama	0	Some of you may know that McDonald's headquarters is located over in Oak Brook, Illinois.
Obama	0	But what you may not know about is three very innovative McDonald's restaurants that have opened around the state.
Obama	0	At these restaurants, you pull up to a drive-through window to give your order.
Obama	0	Nothing new there.
Obama	0	But while you're pondering which processed food to order, your order's being processed by a voice that's sitting hundreds of miles away at a call center in Colorado or even Canada.
Obama	0	There, they take a digital picture of your car, match it up with your order, and send it back to the people preparing your food.
Obama	0	This makes the orders quicker, more accurate, and more profitable for McDonald's.
Obama	0	And just like that, driving back to yell at the person who forgot your fries could mean a 14 hour car ride.
Obama	0	So why am I telling this story?
Obama	0	What does this mean for all of you?
Obama	0	It means that we haven't even begun to understand or feel the full impact of the technological revolution that happened in the last decade.
Obama	0	It means walls between countries have been torn down and the global community has become more connected through the internet, cell phones, video phones, and other advances in communication.
Obama	0	And it leaves all of you with this challenge: If the miracle of technology means that McDonald's can send its drive-thru jobs across the country, just think of where other companies can send theirs.
Obama	0	And so while the first Young American Award winners in 1956 competed for jobs with kids in Illinois and Wisconsin and Iowa, you'll be competing with kids from India, China, and all over the world who are being educated more and longer than ever before.
Obama	0	So what do we do?
Obama	0	What can you do?
Obama	0	We can't stop this, but we can be prepared for it.
Obama	0	And as Young American award winners, you've already taken the first step.
Obama	0	See, in this new world, knowledge really is power.
Obama	0	A new idea can lead not just to a new product or a new job, but entire new industries and a new way of thinking about the world.
Obama	0	And so you need to be the Idea Generation.
Obama	0	The generation who's always thinking on the cutting edge, who's wondering how to create and keep the next wave of American jobs and American innovations, who's figuring out how to out-compete the Idea Generations of Indias and Chinas of the world.
Obama	0	They're already sending drive-thru jobs across the country - what will you guys do?
Obama	0	To figure this out, you'll need to graduate first.
Obama	0	Then you'll need a college diploma - and we need to make sure that everyone in America is afforded the chance to get one of those.
Obama	0	Last year, 220,000 young people gave up on their dream to go to college for the simple reason that they could not afford the price of tuition, which is now rising at the rate of almost 10% a year.
Obama	0	If we have any hope of competing and winning in today's economy, we cannot let our kids' college dreams be dashed because of a hefty price tag.
Obama	0	In Washington, I've been trying to do something about this by introducing the HOPE Act, which would make college more affordable for 430,000 Americans by increasing Pell Grant awards.
Obama	0	But we must do more to make sure that young Americans here and everywhere have a chance at a college diploma.
Obama	0	But even beyond those diplomas, you'll need something else to succeed in the years ahead.
Obama	0	You'll need to keep that spark that's got this far.
Obama	0	The one that will keep you learning the new rules, solving the new mysteries, and discovering the new answers of this brand new century.
Obama	0	It is this fundamental character of the American spirit - the desire to move forward, look around the next corner, and reach for the unreachable - that put the first man on the moon, led to a cure for polio, and launched the technological revolution of the nineties.
Obama	0	And if you Young Americans keep that spirit alive, I think we'll be just fine.
Obama	0	Congratulations to all of you on your achievements, and may God Bless you.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	NAACP FIGHT FOR FREEDOM FUND DINNER TOPIC: Civil Rights May 1st, 2005 NAACP Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner Detroit, MI Complete Text Thank you.
Obama	0	Half a century after the first few hundred people sat for justice and equality at these tables, I am honored to be here with this crowd of thousands at the 50th NAACP Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner.
Obama	0	Founded at a time when we were constantly reminded how the world around us was separate and unequal...when the idea of legal rights for black folks was almost a contradiction in terms...when lunch counters and bus seats and water fountains were luxuries you had to fight for and march for, the 50th anniversary of the Fight for Freedom Dinner reminds us of just how far our struggle has come.
Obama	0	I was reminded of this last month, when I had the honor of going to Atlanta to speak at John Lewis's 65th birthday celebration.
Obama	0	Many of the luminaries of the Civil Rights Movement were down there, and I had the great honor of sitting between Ethel Kennedy and Coretta Scott King, who both turned to me and said "we're really looking forward to hearing you speak."
Obama	0	Now that's a really intimidating thing!
Obama	0	And as I stood up there next to John Lewis, not a giant in stature, but a giant of compassion and courage, I thought to myself, never in a million years would I have guessed that I'd be serving in Congress with John Lewis.
Obama	0	And then I thought, you know, there was once a time when John Lewis might never have guessed that he'd be serving in Congress.
Obama	0	And there was a time not long before that when people might never have guessed that someday, black folks would be able to go to the polls, pick up a ballot, make their voice heard, and elect that Congress.
Obama	0	But we can, and many of us are here, because people like John Lewis believed.
Obama	0	Because people feared nothing and risked everything for those beliefs.
Obama	0	Because they saw injustice and endured pain in order to right what was wrong.
Obama	0	We're here tonight because of them, and to them we owe the deepest gratitude.
Obama	0	The road we have taken to this point has not been easy.
Obama	0	But then again, the road to change never is.
Obama	0	Some of you might know that I taught Constitutional Law at the Chicago Law school for awhile.
Obama	0	And one of the courses I taught was a course in race and law, where we chronicled the history of race in this country and people's struggle to achieve freedom in the courts and on the streets.
Obama	0	And often times my students would come up to me and say things like, "Boy I wish I could've been around at the height of the Civil Rights Movement.
Obama	0	Because things seemed so clear at the time.
Obama	0	And while there may have been room for debate on some things, the clarity of the cause and the need for the movement were crystal clear, and you didn't have the ambiguities you have today.
Obama	0	Because it's one thing to know that everyone has a seat at the lunch counter, but how do we figure out how everyone can pay for the meal?
Obama	0	It was easy to figure out that blacks and whites should be able to go to school together, but how do we make sure that every child is equipped and ready to graduate?
Obama	0	It was easy to talk about dogs and fire hoses, but how do we talk about getting drugs and guns off the streets?"
Obama	0	This is what they told me.
Obama	0	And of course, I reminded them that it wasn't very easy at all.
Obama	0	That the moral certainties we now take for granted - that separate can never be equal, that the blessings of liberty enshrined in our Constitution belong to all of us, that our children should be able to go to school together and play together and grow up together - were anything but certain in 1965.
Obama	0	I reminded them that even within the African-American community, there was disagreement about how much to stir things up.
Obama	0	We have a church in Chicago that's on what use to be known as State Park Way.
Obama	0	After Dr. King's assassination, the street was renamed to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.
Obama	0	But the pastor of the church - a prominent African-American in the community - hated Dr. King so bad that he actually changed the address of the church.
Obama	0	And so it's never been clear.
Obama	0	And it's never been easy.
Obama	0	To get to where we are today it took struggle and sacrifice, discipline and tremendous courage.
Obama	0	And sometimes, when I reflect on those giants of the Civil Rights movement, I wonder - where did you find that courage?
Obama	0	John Lewis, where did you find that courage?
Obama	0	Dorothy Height, where did you find that courage?
Obama	0	Rosa Parks, where did you find that courage?
Obama	0	When you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gas...when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the Lord for salvation?
Obama	0	Where do you find that courage?
Obama	0	I don't know.
Obama	0	But I do know that it's worth examining because the challenges we face today are going to require this kind of courage.
Obama	0	The battle lines may have shifted and the barriers to equality may be new, but what's not new is the need for everyday heroes to stand up and speak out for what they believe is right.
Obama	0	Fifty years ago this country decided that Linda Brown shouldn't have to walk miles and miles to school every morning when there was a white school just four blocks away because when it comes to education in America, separate can never be equal.
Obama	0	Now that ruling came about because the NAACP was willing to fight tirelessly and risk its reputation; because everyday Americans - black and white - were willing to take to the streets and risk their freedom.
Obama	0	Because people showed courage.
Obama	0	Fifty years later, what kind of courage are we showing to ensure that our schools are foundations of opportunity for our children?
Obama	0	In a world where kids from Detroit aren't just competing with kids from Macomb for middle-class jobs, but with kids from Malaysia and New Delhi, ensuring that every American child gets the best education possible is the new civil rights challenge of our time.
Obama	0	A student today armed with only a high school diploma will earn an average of only $25,000 a year - if you're African-American, it's 14% less than that.
Obama	0	Meanwhile, countries like China are graduating twice as many students with a college degree as we do.
Obama	0	We're falling behind, and if want our kids to have the same chances we had in life, we must work harder to catch up.
Obama	0	So what are we doing about it?
Obama	0	When we see that America has one of the highest high school dropout rates in the industrialized world - even higher for African-Americans and Hispanics, what are we doing about it?
Obama	0	When we see that our high school seniors are scoring lower on their math and science tests than almost any other students in the world at a time when expertise in these areas is the ticket to a high-wage job, what are we doing about it?
Obama	0	When we see that for every hundred students who enter ninth grade, only eighteen - eighteen - will earn any kind of college degree within six years of graduating high school, what are we doing about it?
Obama	0	And when we see broken schools, old textbooks, and classrooms bursting at the seams, what are we doing about that?
Obama	0	I'll tell you what they've been doing in Washington.
Obama	0	In Washington, they'll talk about the importance of education one day and sign big tax cuts that starve our schools the next.
Obama	0	They'll talk about Leaving No Child Behind but then say nothing when it becomes obvious that they've left the money behind.
Obama	0	In the budget they passed this week in Congress, they gave out over $100 billion in tax cuts, on top of the trillions they've already given to the wealthiest few and most profitable corporations.
Obama	0	One hundred billion dollars.
Obama	0	Think about what that could do for our kids if we invested that in our schools.
Obama	0	Think of how many new schools we could build, how many great teachers we could recruit, what kind of computers and technology we could put in our classrooms.
Obama	0	Think about how much we could invest in math and science so our kids could be prepared for the 21st century economy.
Obama	0	Think about how many kids we could send to college who've worked hard, studied hard, but just can't afford the tuition.
Obama	0	Think about all that potential and all that opportunity.
Obama	0	Think about the choice Washington made instead.
Obama	0	And now think about what you can do about it.
Obama	0	I believe we have a mutual responsibility to make sure our schools are properly funded, our teachers are properly paid, and our students have access to an affordable college education.
Obama	0	And if we don't do something about all that, than nothing else matters.
Obama	0	But I also believe we have an individual responsibility as well.
Obama	0	Our grandparents use to tell us that being Black means you have to work twice as hard to succeed in life.
Obama	0	And so I ask today, can we honestly say our kids are working twice as hard as the kids in India and China who are graduating ahead of us, with better test scores and the tools they need to kick our butts on the job market?
Obama	0	Can we honestly say our teachers are working twice as hard, or our parents?
Obama	0	One thing's for sure, I certainly know that Washington's not working twice as hard - and that's something each of us has a role in changing.
Obama	0	Because if we want change in our education system - if we want our schools to be less crowded and funded more equitably; if we want our children to take the courses that will get them ready for the 21st century; if we want our teachers to be paid what they're worth and armed with the tools they need to prepare our kids; than we need to summon the same courage today that those giants of the Civil Rights movement summoned half a century ago.
Obama	0	Because more than anything else, these anniversaries - of the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act and Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner - they remind us that in America, ordinary citizens can somehow find in their hearts the courage to do extraordinary things.
Obama	0	That change is never easy, but always possible.
Obama	0	And it comes not from violence or militancy or the kind of politics that pits us against each other and plays on our worst fears; but from great discipline and organization, and from a strong message of hope.
Obama	0	And when we look at these challenges and think, how can we do this?
Obama	0	How can we cut through the apathy and the partisanship and the business-as-usual culture in Washington?
Obama	0	When we wonder this, we need to rediscover the hope that people have been in our shoes before and they've lived to cross those bridges.
Obama	0	Personally, I find that hope in thinking about a trip I took during my campaign for the U.S. Senate.
Obama	0	About a week after the primary, Dick Durbin and I embarked on a nineteen city tour of Southern Illinois.
Obama	0	And one of the towns we went to was a place called Cairo, which, as many of you might know, achieved a certain notoriety during the late 60s and early 70s as having one of the worst racial climates in the country.
Obama	0	You had an active white citizen's council there, you had cross burnings, Jewish families were being harassed, you had segregated schools, race riots, you name it - it was going on in Cairo.
Obama	0	And we're riding down to Cairo and Dick Durbin turns to me and says, "Let me tell you about the first time I went to Cairo.
Obama	0	It was about 30 years ago.
Obama	0	I was 23 years old and Paul Simon, who was Lieutenant Governor at the time, sent me down there to investigate what could be done to improve the racial climate in Cairo."
Obama	0	And Dick tells me how he diligently goes down there and gets picked up by a local resident who takes him to his motel.
Obama	0	And as Dick's getting out of the car, the driver says "excuse me, let me just give you a piece of advice.
Obama	0	Don't use the phone in your motel room because the switchboard operator is a member of the white citizen's council, and they'll report on anything you do."
Obama	0	Well, this obviously makes Dick Durbin upset, but he's a brave young man, so he checks in to his room, unpacks his bags and a few minutes later he hears a knock on the door.
Obama	0	He opens up the door and there's a guy standing there who just stares at Dick for a second, and then says, "What the hell are you doing here?"
Obama	0	and walks away.
Obama	0	Well, now Dick is really feeling concerned and so am I because as he's telling me this story, we're pulling in to Cairo.
Obama	0	So I'm wondering what kind of reception we're going to get.
Obama	0	And we wind our way through the town and we go past the old courthouse, take a turn and suddenly we're in a big parking lot and about 300 people are standing there.
Obama	0	About a fourth of them are black and three fourths are white and they all are about the age where they would have been active participants in the epic struggle that had taken place thirty years earlier.
Obama	0	And as we pull closer, I see something.
Obama	0	All of these people are wearing these little buttons that say "Obama for U.S.
Obama	0	Senate."
Obama	0	And they start smiling.
Obama	0	And they start waving.
Obama	0	And Dick and I looked at each other and didn't have to say a thing.
Obama	0	Because if you told Dick thirty years ago that he - the son of Lithuania immigrants born into very modest means in east St. Louis - would be returning to Cairo as a sitting United States Senator, and that he would have in tow a black guy born in Hawaii with a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas named Barack Obama, no one would have believed it.
Obama	0	But it happened.
Obama	0	And it happened because John Lewis and scores of brave Americans stood on that bridge and lived to cross it.
Obama	0	You know, two weeks after Bloody Sunday, when the march finally reached Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to the crowd of thousands and said "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."
Obama	0	He's right, but you know what?
Obama	0	It doesn't bend on its own.
Obama	0	It bends because we help it bend that way.
Obama	0	Because people like John Lewis and Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks and thousands of ordinary Americans with extraordinary courage have helped bend it that way.
Obama	0	And as their examples call out to us from across the generations, we continue to progress as a people because they inspire us to take our own two hands and bend that arc.
Obama	0	Congratulations to all of you here at the NAACP who are busy bending that arc.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	NATIONAL PRESS CLUB APRIL 2005  TOPIC: Economic Issues April 26th, 2005 National Press Club Complete Text Thank you.
Obama	0	It's great to be here at the National Press Club - I want to thank the club as well as the FDR Institute for arranging this luncheon together.
Obama	0	I'd also like to thank Anne Roosevelt and Jim Roosevelt, who inspire us all by carrying on the proud legacy of their grandfather.
Obama	0	By the time the Senate Finance Committee holds the first Senate hearing on the President's Social Security plan today, we'll have heard just about everything there is to be said about the issue.
Obama	0	We've heard about privatization and benefit cuts, about massive new debt and huge new risks, and we've even been scared into thinking the system will go broke when our kids retire, even though we know there'll be enough money then to pay the vast majority of benefits.
Obama	0	I'm happy to address some of these issues in the Q and A after the speech.
Obama	0	But aside from the usual back and forth of this debate, I can't help but think about the larger issue at stake here.
Obama	0	Think about the America that Franklin Roosevelt saw when he looked out the windows of the White House from his wheelchair - an America where too many were ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure.
Obama	0	An America where more and more Americans were finding themselves on the losing end of a new economy, and where there was nothing available to cushion their fall.
Obama	0	Some thought that our country didn't have a responsibility to do anything about these problems, that people would be better off left to their own devices and the whims of the market.
Obama	0	Others believed that American capitalism had failed and that it was time to try something else altogether.
Obama	0	But our President believed deeply in the American idea.
Obama	0	He understood that the freedom to pursue our own individual dreams is made possible by the promise that if fate causes us to stumble or fall, our larger American family will be there to lift us up.
Obama	0	That if we're willing to share even a small amount of life's risks and rewards with each other, then we'll all have the chance to make the most of our God-given potential.
Obama	0	And because Franklin Roosevelt had the courage to act on this idea, individual Americans were able to get back on their feet and build a shared prosperity that is still the envy of the world.
Obama	0	The New Deal gave the laid-off worker a guarantee that he could count on unemployment insurance to put food on his family's table while he looked for a new job.
Obama	0	It gave the young man who suffered a debilitating accident assurance that he could count on disability benefits to get him through the tough times.
Obama	0	A widow might still raise her children without the indignity of charity.
Obama	0	And Franklin Roosevelt's greatest legacy promised the couple who put in a lifetime of sacrifice and hard work that they could retire in comfort and dignity because of Social Security.
Obama	0	Today, we're told by those who want to privatize that promise how much things are different and times have changed since Roosevelt's day.
Obama	0	I couldn't agree more.
Obama	0	A child born in this new century is likely to start his life with both parents - or a single parent - working full-time jobs.
Obama	0	They'll try their hardest to juggle work and family, but they'll end up needing child care to keep him safe, cared for, and educated early.
Obama	0	They'll want to give him the best education possible, but unless they live in a wealthy town with good public schools, they'll have to settle for less or find the money for private schools.
Obama	0	This student will study hard and dream of going to the best colleges in the country, but with tuition rising higher and faster than ever before, he may have to postpone those dreams or start life deeper in debt than any generation before him.
Obama	0	When he graduates from college, this young man will find a job market where middle-class manufacturing jobs with good benefits have long been replaced with low-wage, low-benefit service sector jobs and high-skill, high-wage jobs of the future.
Obama	0	To get those good jobs, he'll need the skills and knowledge to not only compete with other workers in America, but with highly skilled and highly knowledgeable workers all over the world who are being recruited by the same companies that once made their home in this country.
Obama	0	When he finally starts his job, he'll want health insurance, but rising costs mean that fewer employers can afford to provide that benefit, and when they do, fewer employees can afford the record premiums.
Obama	0	When he starts a family, he'll want to buy a house and a car and pay for child care and college for his own children, but as he watches the lucky few benefit from lucrative bonuses and tax shelters, he'll see his own tax burden rise and his own paycheck barely cover this month's bills.
Obama	0	And when he retires, he'll hope that he and his wife have saved enough, but if there wasn't enough to save, he'll hope that there will still be two Social Security checks that come to the house every month.
Obama	0	These are the challenges we face at the beginning of the 21st century.
Obama	0	We shouldn't exaggerate; we aren't seeing the absolute deprivation of the Great Depression.
Obama	0	But it cannot be denied that families face more risk and greater insecurity than we have known since FDR's time, even as those families have fewer resources available to help pull themselves through the tough spots.
Obama	0	Whereas people were once able to count on their employer to provide health care, pensions, and a job that would last a lifetime, today's worker wonders if suffering a heart attack will cause his employer to drop his coverage, worries about how much he can contribute to his own pension fund, and fears the possibility that he might walk into work tomorrow and find his job outsourced.
Obama	0	Yet, just as the naysayers in Roosevelt's day told us that there was nothing we could do to help people help themselves, the people in power today are telling us that instead of sharing the risks of the new economy, we should shoulder them on our own.
Obama	0	In the end, this is what the debate over the future of Social Security is truly about.
Obama	0	After a lifetime of hard work and contribution to this country, do we tell our seniors that they're on their own, or that we're here for them to provide a basic standard of living?
Obama	0	Is the dignity of life in their latter years their problem, or one we all share?
Obama	0	Since this is Washington, you won't hear them answer those questions directly when they talk about Social Security.
Obama	0	Instead, they use the word "reform" when they mean "privatize," and they use "strengthen" when they really mean "dismantle."
Obama	0	They tell us there's a crisis to get us all riled up so we'll sit down and listen to their plan to privatize.
Obama	0	But we know what the whole thing's really about.
Obama	0	It's not just about cutting guaranteed benefits by up to 50% -- though it certainly does that.
Obama	0	It's not just about borrowing $5 trillion from countries like China and Japan to finance the plan - after all, we know how fiscal conservatives hate debt and deficit.
Obama	0	And it's not even about the ability private accounts to finance the gap in the system - because even the privatization advocates admit they don't.
Obama	0	What this whole thing is about, and why conservatives have been pushing it so hard for so long now, is summed up in one sentence in one White House memo that somehow made its way out of the White House: "For the first time in six decades, the Social Security battle is one we can win - and in doing so, we can help transform the political and philosophical landscape of the country."
Obama	0	And there it is.
Obama	0	Since Social Security was first signed into law almost seventy years ago, at a time when FDR's opponents were calling it a hoax that would never work and some likened it to communism, there has been movement after movement to get rid of the program for purely ideological reasons.
Obama	0	Because some still believe that we can't solve the problems we face as one American community; they think this country works better when we're left to face fate by ourselves.
Obama	0	I understand this view.
Obama	0	There's something bracing about the Social Darwinist idea, the idea that there isn't a problem that the unfettered free market can't solve.
Obama	0	It requires no sacrifice on the part of those of us who have won life's lottery...and doesn't consider who our parents were, or the education we received, or the right breaks that came at the right time.
Obama	0	But I couldn't disagree more.
Obama	0	If we privatize Social Security, what will we tell retirees whose investments in the stock market went badly?
Obama	0	We're sorry?
Obama	0	Keep working?
Obama	0	You're on your own?
Obama	0	When people's expected benefits get cut and they have to choose between their groceries and their prescriptions, what will we say then?
Obama	0	That's not our problem?
Obama	0	When our debt climbs so high that our children face sky-high taxes just as they're starting their first job, what will we tell them?
Obama	0	Deal with it yourselves?
Obama	0	This isn't how America works.
Obama	0	This isn't how we saved millions of seniors from a life of poverty seventy years ago.
Obama	0	This isn't how we sent a greatest generation of veterans to college so they could build the greatest middle-class in history.
Obama	0	And this isn't how we should face the challenges of this new century either.
Obama	0	And yet, this is the direction they're trying to take America on almost every issue.
Obama	0	Instead of trying to contain the skyrocketing cost of health care and expand access to the uninsured, the idea behind the President's Health Savings Accounts are to leave the system alone and give you a few extra bucks to go find a plan you can afford on your own.
Obama	0	You deal with double digit inflation by going to the doctor less.
Obama	0	Instead of strengthening a pension system that provides defined benefits to employees who've worked a lifetime, we'll give you a tax break and hope that you invest well and save well in your own little account.
Obama	0	And if none of this works - if you couldn't find affordable insurance and suffer an illness that leaves you thousands of dollars in debt - then you should no longer count on being able to start over by declaring bankruptcy because they've changed the law to put the burden of debt squarely on your shoulders.
Obama	0	Taking responsibility for oneself and showing individual initiative are American values we all share.
Obama	0	Frankly, they're values we could stand to see more of in a culture where the buck is too often passed to the next guy.
Obama	0	They are values we could use more of here in Washington too.
Obama	0	But the irony of this all-out assault against every existing form of social insurance is that these safety nets are exactly what encourage each of us to be risk-takers and entrepreneurs who are free to pursue our individual ambitions.
Obama	0	We get into a car knowing that if someone rear-ends us, they will have insurance to pay for the repairs.
Obama	0	We buy a house knowing that our investment is protected by homeowners insurance.
Obama	0	We take a chance on start-ups and small businesses because we know that if they fail, there are protections available to cushion our fall.
Obama	0	Corporations across America have limited liability for this very reason.
Obama	0	Families should too - and that's why we need social insurance.
Obama	0	This is how the market works.
Obama	0	This is how America works.
Obama	0	And if we want it to keep working, we need to develop new ways for all of us to share the new risks of a 21st century economy, not destroy what we already have.
Obama	0	The genius of Roosevelt was putting into practice the idea that America doesn't have to be a place where our individual aspirations are at war with our common good; it's a place where one makes the other possible.
Obama	0	I think we will save Social Security from privatization this year.
Obama	0	And in doing so, we will affirm our belief that we are all connected as one people - ready to share life's risks and rewards for the benefit of each and the good of all.
Obama	0	Let me close by suggesting that Democrats are absolutely united in the need to strengthen Social Security and make it solvent for future generations.
Obama	0	We know that, and we want that.
Obama	0	And I believe that both Democrats and Republicans can work together to do that.
Obama	0	While we're at it, we can begin a debate about the real challenges America faces as the baby boomers begin to retire.
Obama	0	About getting a handle on the growing cost of health care and prescription drugs.
Obama	0	About increasing individual and national savings.
Obama	0	About strengthening our pension system for the 21st century.
Obama	0	These are important questions that require us to work together, not in a manufactured panic about a genuine but solvable problem, but with the spirit of pragmatism and innovation that will offer every American the secure retirement they have earned.
Obama	0	You know, there are times in the life of this nation where we are individual citizens going about our own business, enjoying the freedoms we've been blessed with.
Obama	0	And then there are times when we are one America, linked by the dignity of each and the destiny of all.
Obama	0	The debate over the future of Social Security must be one of these times.
Obama	0	The people I've met since starting my campaign tell me they don't want a big government that's running their lives, but they do want an active government that will give them the opportunity to make the most of their lives.
Obama	0	Starting with the child born today and the senior moving into the twilight of life, together we can provide that opportunity.
Obama	0	The day Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act of 1935 into law, he began by saying that "Today, a hope of many years' standing is in large part fulfilled."
Obama	0	It is now time to fulfill our hope for an America where we're in this together - for our seniors, for our children, and for every American in the years and generations yet to come.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	SIUC COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE 50TH ANNIVERSARY   TOPIC: Oil & Alternative Fuels Saturday, April 23, 2005 SIUC College of Agriculture's 50th Anniversary Full Text of Barack Obama’s Speech Thank you.
Obama	0	It's always great to be here in Carbondale, and a real honor to speak here at SIUC's first Agriculture Industry Day.
Obama	0	Now, I'll be honest - I haven't done all that much farming living on the South Side of Chicago.
Obama	0	But I have to say, my fondest farming memory is when I once offered to help out a friend with his harvest.
Obama	0	Knowing the full range of my agricultural experience and expertise, he took one look at me and said..."no thanks."
Obama	0	So when I saw that you guys needed a keynote speaker for a lecture entitled, "Growing the Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resource Economy in Southern Illinois," I said "sign me up."
Obama	0	But seriously, while I don't farm, what I did do during my eight years in the Illinois State Senate, and what I'm doing now as a Senator in Washington, is to constantly listen and learn from people who do farm and who do know the business.
Obama	0	And that has helped me tremendously in figuring out how I can best stand up and speak out on the issues that matter to family farmers and to the future of agriculture in this country.
Obama	0	Thanks to all the hard work you're doing here at SIU, that future holds more promise and more potential for America with each passing day.
Obama	0	Because in a world where globalization has made it possible for a student in Carbondale to share ideas with one in Calcutta, yet necessary for them to compete for the same jobs, the advances you're making in agriculture could lead to the breakthroughs we need to maintain America's global leadership in the years to come.
Obama	0	This is our new challenge for the new century - and it's different than anything we've ever faced before.
Obama	0	Just think about what the world was like only fifty years ago, when the College of Agriculture was a small, five-man department that taught its students in a few old army barracks.
Obama	0	Back then, the big challenge was navigating the soils found in the hills and valleys of southern Illinois.
Obama	0	If you could master that, you were ready to graduate and live the farming life, knowing that it would be enough to provide for you and your family.
Obama	0	And even if you didn't go to a fine school like SIU, in those days you still had a shot at the American Dream.
Obama	0	Because whether it was on the farm or in a factory, a middle-class job that paid a decent wage and good benefits was easy to come by - and it would probably last you a lifetime.
Obama	0	Hard work and sacrifice paid off for most families, and because of the wealth they built, America's economic leadership was unchallenged.
Obama	0	But the world has certainly changed since then, hasn't it?
Obama	0	Today, even a college degree doesn't guarantee a middle-class job that will support a family.
Obama	0	What's worse, the cost of getting that degree and the price of health care on that job are rising higher and faster than ever before.
Obama	0	Family farmers are being squeezed by big agribusiness, and factory jobs are heading across the ocean where labor is cheap.
Obama	0	We can make sure that the new jobs and new industries that take their place stay in America - but it won't happen by itself.
Obama	0	Countries like India and China are churning out more and more qualified college graduates who can compete directly with Americans for jobs that can now be done anywhere in the world.
Obama	0	If we want to stay on top, we'll need a nationwide commitment to better education, better training, and the research and discovery that have always made America a land of innovation and optimism.
Obama	0	This is where you guys come in.
Obama	0	The title of this lecture - "Growing the Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resource Economy in Southern Illinois" - is really too narrow to capture the full potential of the work you're doing here at the College of Agriculture.
Obama	0	Fifty years ago, it may have only been about the economy in southern Illinois.
Obama	0	Fifty years ago, the work you're doing may not have had an impact beyond the farms and borders of a small town like Carbondale.
Obama	0	But today we live in a different world.
Obama	0	Today, a discovery made right here in your Food and Nutrition department could save a person from a lifetime of diabetes in southern California.
Obama	0	An SIU student who publishes a paper online about the benefits of soy in preventing prostate cancer could attract the attention of a researcher in Boston who's working on a cure.
Obama	0	And a professor who makes a breakthrough in developing drought-resistant crops could save millions from hunger in Africa.
Obama	0	Today, the work you're doing here not only has the potential to improve the lives of people in Illinois and across the world; it offers the opportunity to develop new ideas that will lead to new jobs and a new competitive edge for America in the 21st century.
Obama	0	This is the way we can win in the global economy, and here at this school in this Illinois small town, you're helping us get there.
Obama	0	Right now, researchers at this college are studying ways to improve the production and efficiency of ethanol.
Obama	0	Again, this may sound small, but just imagine what this could do for our country.
Obama	0	Any of you who've pulled into a gas station lately have noticed how high the prices are getting.
Obama	0	You might have decided to drive your car less, or you might have noticed that the cost of gas is cutting into your family budget.
Obama	0	The price of oil has now climbed to a record of over $50 a barrel, and we don't even know how much worse it's going to get.
Obama	0	So what do we do about this?
Obama	0	We only have 3% of the world's oil reserves - 65% of our oil is imported from the Middle East.
Obama	0	So unless we want to stay dependent forever on a region of the world that's dangerous, politically unstable, and willing to do lord-knows-what with the price of oil, we must find new sources of energy here in America.
Obama	0	It seems like politicians have been saying this forever.
Obama	0	But when you look at the record gas prices, and the possibility for more war and turmoil in the Middle East, it's clear that we need less talk and more action.
Obama	0	We can start by producing more ethanol in America.
Obama	0	The future of energy in this country doesn't have to remain in the deserts of the Middle East; we can find it in the corn fields of Illinois and across the Midwest.
Obama	0	Imagine running our cars with a fuel we can literally grow as much as we want of.
Obama	0	Imagine using a fuel that's clean and healthy, that's selling for 50 cents cheaper than gasoline, and that places America's energy needs in America's hands.
Obama	0	This kind of future is here - but to expand ethanol's promise across the nation, you guys need to keep up the great research here and we need to step up the legislative process in Washington.
Obama	0	Recently, I joined a few other Senators in introducing a bill that would increase America's renewable fuel standard and increase ethanol production along with it.
Obama	0	A bill like this that's already passed the Senate twice would've provided us with 500,000 barrels a day of refined ethanol for use in gasoline and would save us $4 billion every year in imported oil and gasoline costs.
Obama	0	Just think of what this would do for our economy.
Obama	0	Farmers would earn more for their corn, businesses would invest more in the type of community-sized ethanol facilities that would grow the downstate economy, and over 200,000 jobs would be created.
Obama	0	We've got bipartisan support for this bill, so I'm pretty confident that this is the year we're finally going to get it done.
Obama	0	The other ethanol bill I've introduced would make it easier for more cars to be powered by cheaper, cleaner, ethanol-based fuel.
Obama	0	As most of you probably know, there's a fuel known as E85 that's made from 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.
Obama	0	It's a great alternative to gasoline, but the only problem is that we're in short supply of E85 fueling stations.
Obama	0	Down here in southern Illinois, you drive by miles and miles of corn fields that can produce ethanol, but only 3 E85 stations in all of southern Illinois, and not one in Carbondale.
Obama	0	So the bill I'm sponsoring would provide a tax credit of 50% to anyone who wants to build an E85 fuel station.
Obama	0	And to give consumers a good deal too, it'll provide a tax credit of 35 cents per gallon of E85 fuel.
Obama	0	We've talked for too long about energy independence in this country, and I think these proposals finally give us an opportunity to do something about it.
Obama	0	You've all been doing your part here at SIU, and it's high time for Washington to do our part.
Obama	0	I've always believed that the incredible story of progress that is America has been built by those who ask why, what if, and why not - questions asked by the very students at this college every day they choose to confront the challenges of this new century.
Obama	0	It is this fundamental character of the American spirit - the desire to move forward, look around the next corner, and reach for the unreachable - that put the first man on the moon, led to a cure for polio, and launched the technological revolution of the nineties.
Obama	0	And as the College of Agriculture looks ahead to its next fifty years, we'd do well to ask ourselves "What will they say about us at the 100th anniversary?"
Obama	0	As we face a new and different world that brings both great promise and great peril, what will we do move America towards a new and better day?
Obama	0	You won't find the answers from your professors - and certainly not from politicians.
Obama	0	You'll find them by continuing to ask yourselves those questions - why, what if, and why not.
Obama	0	And as you keep studying and researching here at school, remember that the answers you discover will not only have an impact where you live and learn, but across a world that is just waiting to hear from the next generation of dreamers.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	ABRAHAM LINCOLN PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM   TOPIC: Our Past, Our Future, Our Vision April 20, 2005 Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum Remarks by Senator Barack Obama Complete Text Let me congratulate all of those who have helped to make this wonderful vision a reality.
Obama	0	But we gather here today not to celebrate a building.
Obama	0	We gather to celebrate a man.
Obama	0	What is it that makes Lincoln such a seminal figure in our story?
Obama	0	How is it that this man, born in the backwoods of Kentucky, with little formal education, homely and awkward, a man given to depression and wracked with self-doubt, might come to represent so much of who we are as a people, and so much of what we aspire to be?
Obama	0	Some of it has to do with the trajectory of his life.
Obama	0	In his rise from poverty, his self-study and ultimate mastery of language and of law, in his capacity to overcome personal loss and remain determined in the face of repeated defeat - in all of this we see a fundamental element of the American character, a belief that we can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger dreams.
Obama	0	Some of it has to do with the sheer energy of the man, the railsplitter, ax-in-hand, looking out at a frontier of hope and possibility.
Obama	0	Lincoln believed deeply in the American spirit of innovation and exploration that accepts no limits to the heights to which our nation might reach.
Obama	0	In all of this - the repeated acts of self-creation, the insistence that with sweated brow and calloused hands and focused will we can recast the wilderness of the American landscape and the American heart into something better, something finer - in all of this Lincoln embodies our deepest myths.
Obama	0	It is a mythology that drives us still.
Obama	0	And yet what separates Lincoln from the other great men has to do with something else.
Obama	0	It's an issue of character that speaks to us, of moral resolve.
Obama	0	Lincoln was not a perfect man, nor a perfect president.
Obama	0	By modern standards, his condemnation of slavery might be considered tentative; his Emancipation Proclamation more a military document than a clarion call for justice.
Obama	0	He wasn't immune to political considerations; his temperament could be indecisive and morose.
Obama	0	And yet despite these imperfections, despite his fallibility...indeed, perhaps because of a painful self-awareness of his own failings, etched in every crease of his face and reflected in those haunted eyes...because of this essential humanity of his, when it came time to confront the greatest moral challenge this nation has ever faced, Lincoln did not flinch.
Obama	0	He did not equivocate or duck or pass the challenge on to future generations.
Obama	0	He did not demonize the fathers and sons who did battle on the other side, nor seek to diminish the terrible costs of his war.
Obama	0	In the midst of slavery's dark storm and the complexities of governing a house divided, he kept his moral compass pointed firm and true.
Obama	0	It serves us then to reflect on whether that element of Lincoln's character, and the American character - that aspect which makes tough choices, and speaks the truth when least convenient, and acts while still admitting doubt - remains with us today.
Obama	0	Lincoln once said that "character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow.
Obama	0	The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing."
Obama	0	At a time when image all too often trumps substance, when our politics all too often feeds rather than bridges division, when the prospects of a poor youth rising out of poverty seem of no consequence to the powerful, and when we evoke our common God to condemn those who do not think as we do, rather than to seek God's mercy for our own lack of understanding - at such a time it is helpful to remember this man who was the real thing.
Obama	0	Lincoln reminds us that our essential greatness is not the shadow of sophistication or popularity, or wealth or power or fleeting celebrity.
Obama	0	It is the tree that stands in the face of our doubts and fears and bigotries, and insists we can do better.
Obama	0	Today we come to celebrate not a building but a man.
Obama	0	And as that man called once upon the better angels of our nature, so is he calling still, across the ages, to summon some measure of that character, his character, in each of us, today.
Obama	0	AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE MEALS AND PHONE SERVICE TO WOUNDED VETERANS   TOPIC: Veterans April 14, 2005 Statement of Senator Barack Obama Amendment to Provide Meals and Phone Service to Wounded Veterans Complete Text Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to the fiscal year 2005 Emergency Supplemental, which I am pleased to announce is being cosponsored by Senators Corzine, Bingaman, and Graham.
Obama	0	This amendment would meet certain needs of our injured service members in recognition of the tremendous sacrifices they have made in defense of our country.
Obama	0	The other day I had the opportunity to visit some of our wounded heroes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
Obama	0	I know that many of my colleagues have made the same trip and I'd heard about their visits, but there is nothing that can fully prepare you for what you see when you take that first step into the Physical Therapy room.
Obama	0	These are kids in there.
Obama	0	Our kids.
Obama	0	The ones we watched grow up.
Obama	0	The ones we hoped would live lives that were happy, healthy, and safe.
Obama	0	These kids left their homes and families for a dangerous place halfway around the world.
Obama	0	After years of being protected by their parents, these kids risked their lives to protect us.
Obama	0	And now, some of them have come home from that war with scars that may change their lives forever - scars that may never heal.
Obama	0	And yet they sit there in that hospital, so full of hope and still so proud of their country.
Obama	0	These kids are the best of America.
Obama	0	They deserve our highest respect, and they deserve our help.
Obama	0	Recently, I learned that some of our most severely wounded soldiers are being forced to pay for their own meals and their own phone calls while being treated in medical hospitals.
Obama	0	Up until last year, there was a law on the books that prohibited soldiers from receiving both their basic subsistence allowance and free meals from the military.
Obama	0	Basically, this law allowed the government to charge our wounded heroes for food while they were recovering from their war injuries.
Obama	0	Thankfully, this body acted to change this law in 2003 so that wounded soldiers wouldn't have to pay for their meals.
Obama	0	But, we're dealing with a bureaucracy here, and as we all know, nothing is ever simple in a bureaucracy.
Obama	0	So now, because the Department of Defense doesn't consider getting physical therapy or rehabilitation services in a medical hospital as "being hospitalized," there are wounded veterans who still do not qualify for the free meals other veterans receive.
Obama	0	And after 90 days, even those classified as hospitalized on an outpatient status lose their free meals as well.
Obama	0	Also, while our soldiers in the field qualify for free phone service, injured service men and women who may be hospitalized hundreds or thousands of miles from home do not receive this benefit.
Obama	0	For soldiers whose family members aren't able to take off work and travel to a military hospital, hearing the familiar voice of a mom or dad or husband or wife on the other side of the phone can make all the difference in the world.
Obama	0	And yet, our government will not help pay for these calls.
Obama	0	And it will not help pay for those meals.
Obama	0	Think about that.
Obama	0	Think about the sacrifice these kids have made for their country, many of them literally risking life and sacrificing limb.
Obama	0	And now, at $8.10 a meal, they could end up with a $250 bill from the government that sent them to war every single month.
Obama	0	This is wrong, and we have a moral obligation to fix it.
Obama	0	The first amendment that I'm offering today will do this.
Obama	0	It will expand the group of "hospitalized" soldiers who cannot be charged for their meals to include those service members undergoing medical recuperation, therapy or otherwise on "medical hold."
Obama	0	The number of people affected by this amendment will be small.
Obama	0	Only about 4000 service members are estimated to fall under the category of "non-hospitalized."
Obama	0	The amendment is retroactive to January 1, 2005, in an effort to provide those injured service members who may have received bills for their meals with some relief from those costs.
Obama	0	The amendment will also extend free phone service to those injured service members who are hospitalized or otherwise undergoing medical recuperation or therapy.
Obama	0	I am proud that this amendement is supported by the American Legion, and I hope my colleagues will join them in that support.
Obama	0	I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.
Obama	0	These are our kids out there, and they're risking their lives for us.
Obama	0	When they come home with injuries, the government that asked these kids to serve should provide them with the best possible care and support.
Obama	0	This is a small price to pay for those who have sacrificed so much for their country.
Obama	0	I thank the Senior Senator from Alaska and my colleague from Mississippi for working with me on this issue.
Obama	0	I am hopeful we can reach an agreement on this.
Obama	0	THE NUCLEAR OPTION    TOPIC: Foreign Policy & Defense   Wednesday, April 13, 2005 Statement of Senator Barack Obama The Nuclear Option Washington, DC Complete Text Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to think about the implications the nuclear option would have on this chamber and this country.
Obama	0	I urge you to think not just about winning every debate, but about protecting free and democratic debate.
Obama	0	During my Senate campaign, I had the privilege and the opportunity to meet Americans from all walks of life and both ends of the political spectrum.
Obama	0	They told me about their lives, about their hopes, about the issues that mattered to them, and they also told me what they think about Washington.
Obama	0	Because you've all heard it yourselves, I know it won't surprise many of you to learn that a lot of people don't think much gets done around here about the issues they care most about.
Obama	0	They think the atmosphere has become too partisan, the arguments have become too nasty, and the political agendas have become too petty.
Obama	0	And while I haven't been here too long, I've noticed that partisan debate is sharp, and dissent is not always well-received.
Obama	0	Honest differences of opinion and principled compromise often seem to be the victim of a determination to score points against one's opponents.
Obama	0	But the American people sent us here to be their voice.
Obama	0	They understand that those voices can at times become loud and argumentative, but they also hope that we can disagree without being disagreeable.
Obama	0	And at the end of the day, they expect both parties to work together to get the people's business done.
Obama	0	What they don't expect is for one party - be it Republican or Democrat - to change the rules in the middle of the game so that they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet.
Obama	0	The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster - if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate - then the fighting and the bitterness and the gridlock will only get worse.
Obama	0	I understand that Republicans are getting a lot of pressure to do this from factions outside the chamber.
Obama	0	But we need to rise above an "ends justify the means" mentality because we're here to answer to the people - all of the people - not just the ones wearing our party label.
Obama	0	The fact is that both parties have worked together to confirm 95% of this President's judicial nominees.
Obama	0	The Senate has accepted 205 of his 214 selections.
Obama	0	In fact, we just confirmed another one judge this week by a vote of 95-0.
Obama	0	Overall, this is a better record than any President's had in the last 25 years.
Obama	0	For a President who received 51% of the vote and a Senate chamber made up of 55% of the President's party, I'd say that confirming 95% of your judicial nominations is a record I'd be pretty happy with.
Obama	0	Again, I urge my Republican colleagues not to go through with changing these rules.
Obama	0	In the long run, this is not a good result for either party.
Obama	0	One day Democrats will be in the majority again, and this rule change will be no fairer to a Republican minority than it is to a Democratic minority.
Obama	0	Mr. President, I sense that talk of the nuclear option is more about power than about fairness.
Obama	0	I believe some of my colleagues propose this rules change because they can get away with it rather than because they know it's good for our democracy.
Obama	0	Right now, we're faced with rising gas prices, skyrocketing tuition costs, a record number of uninsured Americans, and some of the most serious national security threats we've ever had, all while our bravest young men and women are risking their lives halfway around the world to keep us safe.
Obama	0	These are challenges we all want to meet and problems we all want to solve, even if we don't all agree how to do it.
Obama	0	But if the right of free and open debate is taken away from the minority party and the millions of Americans who asked us to be their voice, I fear that the already partisan atmosphere of Washington will be poisoned to the point where no one will be able to agree on anything.
Obama	0	That doesn't serve anyone's best interests, and it certainly isn't what the patriots who founded this democracy had in mind.
Obama	0	We owe the people who sent us here more than that.
Obama	0	We owe them much more.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	CONFIRMATION HEARING OF JOHN BOLTON   TOPIC: Confirmations   April 11, 2005 Opening Statement of Senator Barack Obama Confirmation Hearing of John Bolton    Mr. Chairman and Senator Biden, the position of United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations is one of the most important diplomatic positions in the entire U.S. government.
Obama	0	Some of the most distinguished Americans - Democrats and Republicans like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, George H.W.
Obama	0	Bush, and Henry Cabot Lodge - have served with honor in this position.
Obama	0	Yet, there is one man from my home state of Illinois whose experience as Permanent Representative is quite relevant today.
Obama	0	Adlai Stevenson served in this position during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Obama	0	And, as we all know, it was Stevenson's presentation to the U.N. Security Council that proved to the world that the Soviets were moving intermediate range missiles into Cuba.
Obama	0	Using charts and photos to build a compelling case, Stevenson declared to Soviet Ambassador Zorin that he was prepared to wait "until Hell freezes over" for Zorin's response to the U.S. charges.
Obama	0	What few people remember is that Stevenson's presentation came on the heels of what one might call an "intelligence failure."
Obama	0	A year earlier, Stevenson had been misled by the White House and the CIA into publicly stating that the United States was not behind the Bay of Pigs invasion.
Obama	0	Stevenson almost resigned over the incident.
Obama	0	This series of events is important to keep in mind today.
Obama	0	During the Cuban Missile Crisis, we were able to succeed diplomatically because of the stature and integrity of our Permanent Representative to the United Nations.
Obama	0	In fact, President Kennedy said that, "the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our greatest national assets."
Obama	0	As a result, Adlai Stevenson was able to get tough, isolate the Soviets, and convince the world we were right.
Obama	0	Today, we face a similar situation.
Obama	0	With the rest of the world questioning our intelligence capabilities, and nuclear proliferation threats from Iran to North Korea that may require action by the U.N. Security Council, we must be able to convince the world that we are right.
Obama	0	Now, more than ever, we need a credible messenger at the U.N.
Obama	0	Unfortunately, I have some serious reservations about whether Mr. Bolton is the right man for the job: First, senior U.S. intelligence officials have called into question Mr. Bolton's credibility on statements he's made about non-proliferation.
Obama	0	There are also accusations related to political pressure on intelligence analysts who did not agree with Mr. Bolton's statements.
Obama	0	Considering that he's the top arms control official at the State Department, this is troubling to say the least.
Obama	0	Second, Mr. Bolton's history of inflammatory statements about the U.N. would seem to make it more difficult for him to advance U.S. interests at the U.N.
Obama	0	I am concerned about whether Mr. Bolton even believes the U.N. is a viable institution and a useful instrument of U.S. foreign policy.
Obama	0	Saying that it wouldn't make a difference if you lop off ten floors of the UN building in New York isn't exactly the best way to earn people's respect and support - whatever the context.
Obama	0	Finally, Mr. Bolton appears to have an overly confrontational history with several member-states on the Security Council.
Obama	0	Like Adlai Stevenson, I believe there are times to be tough.
Obama	0	But statements like "I don't do carrots" coming from someone who wants to be our chief diplomat at the U.N. certainly give me pause.
Obama	0	Mr. Chairman, there is no question that we need someone in New York who is unafraid to shake things up and challenge the status quo.
Obama	0	But, we also need someone with the credibility, temperament, and diplomatic skill to work with other nations, form coalitions, and advance U.S. interests.
Obama	0	That is why I've invoked the memory of Adlai Stevenson here today: he was tough; he was credible; he was diplomatic.
Obama	0	Most importantly, he was effective.
Obama	0	Stevenson proved that we should not make compromises or trade-offs when selecting our Representative to the U.N.
Obama	0	I want to give Mr. Bolton a chance to speak on these issues, and so my mind is not made up yet.
Obama	0	I want to hear from him as to how he can be an effective and credible advocate for the U.S.
Obama	0	I look forward to hearing his testimony and answers to the Committee's questions.
Obama	0	AMERICAN LEGION LEGISLATIVE RALLY REMARKS BY SENATOR BARACK OBAMA   March 1, 2005 American Legion Legislative Rally Remarks by Senator Barack Obama  Thank you.
Obama	0	It's an honor to be here today with all of you Legionnaires.
Obama	0	Since joining the Veterans Affairs Committee last month, I've been holding town halls with veterans all over Illinois, and I can tell you that in the days ahead, there will be few issues I'll work harder on than ensuring that the brave men and women who serve our country receive the support they deserve and the benefits they've earned when they come home.
Obama	0	In the coming weeks, you'll hear a lot of debate over the veterans' budget that President Bush submitted to Congress.
Obama	0	You'll hear people talk about what we can afford and what adds up on paper, about where we can save money and what percentage increase or decrease we should give to this program or that program.
Obama	0	But I know those aren't the first things that came to your mind when you heard about this budget.
Obama	0	And they're not the first things that came to my mind either.
Obama	0	I thought about my grandfather, who signed up for duty in World War II the day after Pearl Harbor.
Obama	0	He marched across Europe in Patton's army, and when he came home, it was the education and opportunity offered by the GI Bill that allowed his family to build their own American Dream.
Obama	0	I thought about the hundreds of Illinois veterans I've met over the last few years.
Obama	0	We asked them to leave their homes, leave their families, and risk their lives in some far-off place to protect us.
Obama	0	And yet, somehow, we're still hearing stories like the one I heard from a veteran named Bill Allen, who told me that on a trip to Chicago, he actually saw homeless veterans fighting over access to the dumpsters.
Obama	0	That's what I thought about.
Obama	0	And finally, I thought about a young man named Seamus Ahern, who I met during the campaign at a V.F.W.
Obama	0	hall in East Moline, Illinois.
Obama	0	He told me about how he'd joined the Marines because he was so proud of this country, and he felt that as a young person in his early twenties he wanted to give something back.
Obama	0	He was getting shipped out to Iraq the following week, and as I listened to him explain why he?d enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of us might hope for in a child.
Obama	0	But then I asked myself: When Shamus comes home, will we serve him as well as he served us?
Obama	0	That's the question we should be asking ourselves when we talk about veterans' benefits and the veterans' budget.
Obama	0	And that's the standard we should meet.
Obama	0	But how do we meet that standard and serve our veterans when we have a budget that, when adjusted for inflation, has even less money for veterans than it did a year ago?
Obama	0	When we have less for health care, for hospitals, and for disability pay?
Obama	0	This budget tells our veterans that if you want increased funding for the VA, you'll have to pay for it yourself.
Obama	0	It's a budget that charges 2.2 million veterans a $250 enrollment fee just to enter into the health care program they were promised upon enlisting.
Obama	0	A budget that more than doubles veterans' prescription drug co-payments.
Obama	0	That will cut $351 million in funding for veterans' nursing homes, and will eliminate more than $100 million in state grants that are desperately needed by VA facilities across the country.
Obama	0	And this is a budget that tells all those veterans still waiting for help to keep waiting.
Obama	0	There are roughly 480,000 compensation and pension claims still unprocessed, but this budget only calls for 113 new employees to help deal with this backlog ?
Obama	0	not enough to make a dent.
Obama	0	In Chicago, veterans are waiting an average of 138 days just to start the sometimes decade-long process of getting their disability claim processed.
Obama	0	138 days.
Obama	0	How can we make our heroes wait this long?
Obama	0	As troops continue to come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, the numbers and the need will only increase.
Obama	0	We know that soldiers are already coming home with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and we know that a recent Army study showed that one in six soldiers in Iraq reported symptoms of major depression.
Obama	0	Some experts predict that more than 100,000 soldiers may need some kind of mental health treatment when they come home.
Obama	0	For tens of thousands of others, the wounds they suffered in battle will need care that could last a lifetime.
Obama	0	It is not only our patriotic duty to provide this care, it is our moral duty at the most fundamental level.
Obama	0	When our troops return from battle, we should welcome them with the promise of opportunity, not the threat of poverty.
Obama	0	Over half a century ago, it was American Legion National Commander Harry Colmery who first drafted the legislation longhand that would become the GI Bill of Rights ?
Obama	0	a bill that has since provided education and training for nearly 8 million Americans, housing for nearly 2 million families, and led to the creation of the great American middle-class.
Obama	0	That was a bill that told our heroes "When you come home, we're here for you, because we're all in this together."
Obama	0	Today, we shouldn't be scraping to find the bare minimum in benefits and health care for our veterans.
Obama	0	And with the largest deployment of troops since Vietnam fighting for freedom in an increasingly dangerous world, we should be talking about a GI Bill for the 21st Century.
Obama	0	Fortunately, my colleague, Congressman Rahm Emanuel, has just introduced such a bill.
Obama	0	It's called the Welcome Home Package, and it offers veterans the exact same health care they received during their time in the service, double the education benefit they receive now, and a $5,000 down payment on a home.
Obama	0	When veterans look to Congress for help, this is the kind of legislation they should hear about ?
Obama	0	not budget cuts and increased fees.
Obama	0	It's time to reassess our priorities.
Obama	0	A budget is more than just a series of numbers on a page; it is an embodiment of our values.
Obama	0	The President never hesitates to praise the service of our veterans and acknowledge the debt we owe them for their service, and I commend him for that.
Obama	0	Now I hope he will renew his commitment by increasing funding for the VA, and ensure that our veterans receive more than just words of praise, but also the health care and benefits they?ve earned.
Obama	0	George Washington once said: "the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by our nation."
Obama	0	Washington understood then what every veteran here knows now ?
Obama	0	that when we make the decision to send our troops to war, we also make the decision to care for them, to speak for them, and to think of them ?
Obama	0	always ?
Obama	0	when they come.
Obama	0	Thank you and God Bless you.
Obama	0	CURE KEYNOTE ADDRESS REMARKS OF BARACK OBAMA  Friday, March 11, 2005 CURE Keynote Address Complete Text     Thank you David for that warm introduction.
Obama	0	David is not only one of the most brilliant political minds in the business today, he is a loving husband, a committed father, and a dear friend who I've been honored to have by my side.
Obama	0	Thank you David for everything you do.
Obama	0	I also want to thank Susan Axelrod and the entire leadership of CURE for allowing me the honor of speaking here this evening.
Obama	0	As many of you know, Susan lives and breathes this organization, from the earliest hours of the morning until late at night, every day of her life.
Obama	0	And I have no doubt that if the rest of us are willing to offer just a fraction of her level of passion and commitment to this cause, one day we'll be gathered here to finally celebrate a cure.
Obama	0	Since I first learned about this organization from David and Susan, I've often thought about the simple act of hope that began its journey.
Obama	0	I've thought about three mothers, sitting around a kitchen table, sharing the pain and the helplessness that go along with watching the child you love, the child whose happiness you live for, struggle with a disease that mom and dad can't fix.
Obama	0	A disease that doesn't necessarily go away with the doctor's medicine, that isn't talked about most nights on the news, that isn't funded and recognized like a lot of the other diseases.
Obama	0	But then I also thought about how on that day, those three mothers said "no more."
Obama	0	Maybe it was the memory of the first time they saw a seizure take their child to that lonely place where they could no longer reach them.
Obama	0	Maybe they thought about the 2.5 million Americans who suffer from epilepsy, the tens of thousands who succumb to it, and the 181,000 more who will be diagnosed this year.
Obama	0	Or maybe as they sat around that kitchen table, three friends living similar experiences, they simply realized that there are some challenges in life you can't take on by yourself.
Obama	0	That there is power and strength in the ability of a community to make a difference.
Obama	0	And that as that community reaches out and grows and finds its voice, so grows the hope that it will someday find a cure.
Obama	0	Well, seven years, thirty research grants, one White House conference, and over $3 million in donations later, I can see tonight that the kitchen table has become a lot more crowded and that this community is on its way.
Obama	0	And yet despite all the progress, the question still weighing on your minds is, "how do we get all the way there?"
Obama	0	How do we get all the way there when, despite the fact that epilepsy affects more Americans than Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and cerebral palsy combined, it still receives far fewer federal research dollars than any of these diseases?
Obama	0	How do we get there when too many policy makers and too much of the public still think that epilepsy is, as Brendan Malone told us in the video, an "inconvenience," rather than a serious, and possibly deadly disease?
Obama	0	I think that we get there the same way that so many of you got us here - by continuing to share your stories and your children's stories with the faith that more and more Americans will open their hearts to listen.
Obama	0	With the faith that if there's a little boy who can't sit through a class without suffering the pain and uncomfortable stares that accompany a seizure, it matters to every mother, even if it's not her son.
Obama	0	That if there's a young woman who can't work and can't take care of herself and can't have children of her own because of the brain damage caused by epilepsy, it matters to every father, even if it's not his daughter.
Obama	0	Personally, I can't begin to imagine what a parent who has a child with epilepsy goes through on a daily basis.
Obama	0	But I know what it's like to be a parent.
Obama	0	And as a father with a little girl who suffers from asthma, I can understand the terror you feel when your child wakes you in the middle of the night gasping for air.
Obama	0	When you would rather stop breathing yourself if it meant that she could start breathing just a little easier.
Obama	0	In this way, your stories touch me as both a father and a friend, and I will leave here tonight having adopted your cause as my own, as so many have done before me.
Obama	0	I will go back to Washington and work with my colleague Rahm Emanuel and others to demand more federal funding for epilepsy research.
Obama	0	But I also believe that if each of us walks out of here and tells the story of the 2.5 million parents, brothers, sisters, daughters, and sons with epilepsy, it will touch others who may not understand this disease, because they are mothers and fathers and friends too.
Obama	0	And as they embrace our cause, we will expand this community of concern until there isn't any room left in this country not to listen.
Obama	0	This has been the story of CURE ever since its founding - the inspiring idea that those of you who have dedicated so much of yourselves to this cause are doing so knowing full well that a cure may not arrive in time to heal your loved ones.
Obama	0	And yet, you continue fighting with the hope that you may spare a nameless face the pain your families have known.
Obama	0	That kind of compassion is heroic, and it is the kind that will eventually defeat this disease.
Obama	0	We need this victory now more than ever because today, we face a new threat in the potential spread of epilepsy to thousands more Americans.
Obama	0	Just last week, USA Today reported that hundreds of U.S. soldiers are returning from Iraq with a condition known as traumatic brain injury, or TBI.
Obama	0	Even though new technology and better body armor are helping them survive bomb and rocket attacks, the blasts are still causing these soldiers brain damage.
Obama	0	As of January, 437 cases have been diagnosed in Army hospitals alone, and some doctors are saying that it could become the "signature wound of the Iraq war."
Obama	0	As some of you may know, TBI is the greatest risk factor for developing epilepsy.
Obama	0	In fact, a study of Vietnam vets showed that 51 percent of those who suffered TBI went on to develop the disease.
Obama	0	We have asked these brave men and women to leave their homes, leave their families, and fight for our freedom on the other side of the world.
Obama	0	And now we are finding out that when they come home, they may develop a life-threatening, debilitating disease that this country has not done nearly enough to treat.
Obama	0	We simply cannot tell our heroes that when it comes to dealing with TBI or epilepsy, they're on their own.
Obama	0	I know CURE won't, and I will go back to Washington and make sure the federal government won't either.
Obama	0	I plan to work with my colleagues in Congress to provide the VA with the funds to research TBI and epilepsy so we can learn more about the disease and develop better tools to care for our heroes.
Obama	0	These soldiers have moms and dads waiting for them at home, they are a part of our community, and we will speak for them.
Obama	0	I know that a lot of you have been struggling with epilepsy for a long time now, and that you've seen both good days and bad.
Obama	0	On the bad days, it may seem like salvation will never come, that parents and children will be suffering with this disease for decades to come.
Obama	0	But I think we find hope by remembering that we've been here before.
Obama	0	That there was a time when America watched helplessly as a mysterious disease left thousands - especially children - disabled for life.
Obama	0	And just as it seemed that no one was paying attention and nothing could be done, a community of compassion awoke and led a March of Dimes to find the cure for polio.
Obama	0	Organized with the help of Franklin Roosevelt and backed by the federal government, the March of Dimes galvanized a nation to conquer polio, dime by dime.
Obama	0	And while Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the discovery of a vaccine, he also knew that at its best, government can be used a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on our own.
Obama	0	And so the people began to care and the dimes piled up and the funding started to flow, and fifty years ago next month, Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine.
Obama	0	I know that we don't have a President with epilepsy, or a major celebrity spokesperson, but we do have a growing community that is on the march.
Obama	0	We have allies in government who know that we can defeat this disease if we work together.
Obama	0	And we have the hope that every parent has for their child.
Obama	0	The hope you have the first time you bring them to the doctor's office, and you just want them to walk out with some medicine and a lollipop.
Obama	0	The hope you have the first day you watch them get on the bus, when you want them to fit in with the rest of the kids and do well in school.
Obama	0	The hope you have the day of their first job, when you want them to call you and let you know how great it went.
Obama	0	The hope you have when they walk down the aisle, when you want nothing more than for them to find love and happiness in life.
Obama	0	These are hopes we hold not only for our own children, but for every parent and every child every where.
Obama	0	And if we leave here tonight determined to turn those hopes into action, into a sustained commitment to fight epilepsy that's more than just about one fundraiser or one benefit, we will find a cure and we will keep hope alive for millions of families for generations to come.
Obama	0	Thank you, and God Bless you.
Obama	0	REMARKS OF SENATOR OBAMA AT TECHNET   Tuesday, March 8, 2005 Remarks at TechNet Complete Text  Thank you John Doer.
Obama	0	It's great to be here with all of you today, and I'm honored that you've given me the opportunity to join this discussion about the role technology can play in our future and our children's future.
Obama	0	And before we begin, I'd just like to recognize your CEO, Rick White, who is leaving TechNet after years of inspired leadership and service to this organization and this country.
Obama	0	Thank you Rick.
Obama	0	We're here today because when it comes to the global economy, the rules of the game have changed.
Obama	0	This is a fact not only understood by a roomful of Silicon Valley CEOs, but by families I met all across Illinois during the campaign.
Obama	0	They know that when it comes to their jobs and their wages, they're not only competing with workers in Naperville and Carbondale, but in New Delhi and Calcutta.
Obama	0	What's more, they know that when it comes to the high-tech, high skill jobs of the future, their children are not only competing with children here in the United States, but with those on the other side of the globe who are increasingly being educated earlier, longer, and with a special emphasis on the math and science skills required for the industries of tomorrow.
Obama	0	These families tell me that they're anxious about their future.
Obama	0	They worry that they could become the first generation of Americans to see their children do worse than they did.
Obama	0	They remember that when we were all growing up, our parents knew that if they pushed us to study and work hard, the best universities would be open to us and we could get any job we wanted.
Obama	0	But today, parents in cities and towns all over America are losing that hope - they're losing the sense that their kids will be able to dream the American dream.
Obama	0	The rules of the game have changed.
Obama	0	And so we must change with them.
Obama	0	But in a country of innovators and optimists - a country that pioneered the first moon landing, discovered the cure for polio, and led the technological revolution of the nineties - I have no doubt that we can.
Obama	0	This is the great project for our time, and so it must become a larger part of the debate in our politics, our businesses, our schools and our homes.
Obama	0	The good news is that we have the resources, we have the brainpower, and we are still an economic and technological giant.
Obama	0	In Illinois alone we have 238,000 high-tech workers.
Obama	0	The University of Illinois at Champagne-Urbana is where Marc Andreesen developed Mosaic, the browser that made the World Wide Web what it is today.
Obama	0	And right now at Argonne National Laboratory, scientists are developing the technology for "grid computing" - which IBM and others believe represents the future of the IT industry.
Obama	0	All across America, world-class universities, first-rate research facilities and brilliant minds are on the cusp of discovering the next big idea that will lift up the quality of our lives, create millions of new jobs, and change our world.
Obama	0	We can take comfort in knowing that, but we can't take it for granted, because right now other countries are looking at places like Silicon Valley and North Carolina's Research Triangle and saying "we want that."
Obama	0	They're investing in better universities, expanding research budgets and venture capital, producing more science and engineering graduates, and passing innovation-friendly public policies.
Obama	0	None of us expect or want the government to lead the next technological revolution, but I believe that we can provide the spark that fuels America's innovation and competitiveness in the global economy.
Obama	0	I believe we can do better than cutting the budget for the National Science Foundation, as this year's budget has done for the first time.
Obama	0	We can do better than falling to 10th place in the world when it comes to providing people with access to Broadband.
Obama	0	We can do better when it comes to using technology to free ourselves from America's dangerous dependence on Mideast oil.
Obama	0	We can do better than burdening businesses with cases of class action abuse, and that's why I cast a tough vote in favor of reform the other week.
Obama	0	And we can do better, think bigger, and act bolder when it comes to education in this country.
Obama	0	The best part about Bill Gates' speech last week was when he said that our schools are in danger of becoming obsolete as tools to educate tomorrow's workers for tomorrow's jobs.
Obama	0	But schools are where our children's dreams begin, and so schools are where we must begin to make those dreams come true.
Obama	0	We shouldn't wait until high school either.
Obama	0	We have to start the way Jim Barksdale of Netscape did when he gave a big grant and a lot of hope to preschoolers in Mississippi.
Obama	0	We can't leave kids behind before they even enter the first grade, and that's why I'll continue to focus on early childhood education as a way to give them the best start in life.
Obama	0	We also know that some of the best ideas in education don't come from Washington, but from local schools all over America.
Obama	0	That's why charter schools are a great way for us to learn from experiments in Topeka and Springfield that schools in Chicago and L.A. can replicate in their own classrooms.
Obama	0	And because the success of your businesses depend on your ability to fill jobs with great minds, we need more corporate and private investment in our schools.
Obama	0	John Doer's work with the New Schools Venture Fund is leading the way on this front, and we should all commend him for that.
Obama	0	As parents and citizens, each of us has a stake in making sure that our schools are doing everything possible to give our kids the competitive edge they'll need in a 21st century economy.
Obama	0	The tests we have now are great ways to gather information about what works and what doesn't, but they're not enough.
Obama	0	I believe that to meet tomorrow's challenges, we should create a national network of academies to train 25,000 new teachers and get them into high-need rural and urban schools.
Obama	0	We should give local schools the latest technology training tools as John Chambers has done with the CISCO Networking Academy Program.
Obama	0	When I was at the University of Chicago, other faculty members and myself developed a program where we essentially adopted primary schools to help them learn how to use the technological opportunities they were being offered.
Obama	0	It's not enough just to set down a computer in a classroom and walk away - we must also train teachers and administrators on how to use that computer and its technology to find new and better ways of educating our children.
Obama	0	Finally, we should work to close the gap that is widening between America and the rest of the world when it comes to math and science graduates.
Obama	0	To do this, we must start by inspiring our children with a sense of purpose...by nurturing their imagination so that they may dream big and then work hard to reach those dreams.
Obama	0	Too often, our children spend hours playing Playstation without ever finding out how to build Playstation.
Obama	0	They watch television but never wonder how it's put together.
Obama	0	They surf web page after web page on the Internet, but are never taught how to design one.
Obama	0	The incredible story of progress that is America has always been built by those who ask why, what if, and why not.
Obama	0	Our schools must begin instilling that wonder in our children again so that their generation will unite around the next great project of our time, whether it be declaring America energy independent or launching the next great technological revolution.
Obama	0	Too often, the debate about education here in Washington degenerates to old arguments and stale ideas.
Obama	0	And so it's time to put aside partisan differences and just talk about what works for our kids and what will keep America competitive in this new century.
Obama	0	Those are goals we all have and hopes we all share.
Obama	0	Yes, the rules of the game have changed.
Obama	0	And now it's time for us to prove to the world that we can still play better than anyone.
Obama	0	The families I've met are ready to try.
Obama	0	Their kids are ready.
Obama	0	TechNet is ready.
Obama	0	And in the coming months, I will do my best to work with my colleagues and make sure our government is ready too.
Obama	0	I want to thank TechNet for doing your part to get this dialogue going, and now I'd like to take a few questions from the audience.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	OBAMA ON S.256, THE BANKRUPTCY ABUSE AND PREVENTION ACT OF 2005  Monday, February 28, 2005  Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama on S.256, the Bankruptcy Abuse and Prevention Act of 2005 Complete Text  Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to address this pending legislation.
Obama	0	This issue should force us to face a fundamental question about who we are as a country, how we progress as a society, and where our values lie as a people: How do we treat our fellow Americans who have fallen on hard times, and what is our responsibility to cushion those falls when they occur?
Obama	0	Proponents claim this bill is designed to curb the worst abuses of our bankruptcy system.
Obama	0	That's a worthy goal, and we can all agree that bankruptcy was never meant to serve as a Get Out of Jail Free Card, for use when you've foolishly gambled away all your savings and don't feel like taking responsibility for your actions.
Obama	0	Business owners and creditors deserve the money they're owed, and anyone who tries to scam the system just because they can should be stopped and forced to pay their debt.
Obama	0	But to accomplish that, this bill would take us from a system where judges weed out the abusers from the honest to a system where all the honest are presumed to be abusers.
Obama	0	Where declaring Chapter 7 bankruptcy is made prohibitively expensive for people who already have suffered financial devastation.
Obama	0	With this bill, it doesn't matter if you ran up your debt on a trip to Vegas or a trip to the Emergency Room, you're still treated the same under the law and you still face the possibility that you'll never get the chance to start over.
Obama	0	Now, it would be one thing if most people were abusing the system and falling into bankruptcy because they were irresponsible with their finances.
Obama	0	But we know that's not the case.
Obama	0	We know that most people fall into bankruptcy as a result of bad luck.
Obama	0	And we know that a recent Harvard study showed that nearly half of all bankruptcies occur because of an illness that ends up sticking families with medical bills they just can't keep up with.
Obama	0	Take the case of Suzanne Gibbons.
Obama	0	A few years back, Suzanne had a good job as a nurse and a home on Chicago's Northwest Side.
Obama	0	Then she suffered a stroke that left her hospitalized for five-days.
Obama	0	And even though she had health insurance through her job, it only covered $4,000 of her $53,000 hospital bill.
Obama	0	Because of her illness, she was soon forced to leave her full-time nursing job and take a temp job that paid less and didn't offer health insurance.
Obama	0	Then the collection agencies started coming after her for hospital bills that she just couldn't keep up with.
Obama	0	She lost her retirement savings, she lost her house, and eventually, she was forced to declare bankruptcy.
Obama	0	If this bill passes as written, Suzanne would be treated by the law the same as any scam artist who cheats the system.
Obama	0	The decision about whether or not she can file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy would never take into account the fact that she fell into financial despair because of her illness.
Obama	0	With all that debt, she would have had to hire a lawyer and pay hundreds of dollars more in increased paperwork.
Obama	0	And after all that, she still may have been told that she was ineligible for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
Obama	0	And so, as much as we'd like to believe that the face of this bankruptcy crisis is credit card addicts who spend their way into debt, the truth is that it's the face of people like Suzanne Gibbons.
Obama	0	It's the face of middle-class America.
Obama	0	Over the last thirty years bankruptcies have gone up 400% -- and we've had more than 2,100 in Illinois just last year.
Obama	0	We also know what else has gone up: the cost of child care and the cost of college, the cost home ownership and the cost of health care - which is now at a record high.
Obama	0	People are working harder and longer for less, and they're falling further and further behind.
Obama	0	And we're not talking about the poor or even just the working poor here.
Obama	0	As bankruptcy professor Elizabeth Warren has noted, these are middle-class families with two parents who both work at good-paying jobs that put a roof over their heads.
Obama	0	They're saving every extra penny they have so that their children can someday do better than they did.
Obama	0	But with just one illness, emergency, or divorce, those dreams can be wiped out.
Obama	0	This bill does a great job helping the credit card industry recover the profits they're losing, but what are we doing to help middle-class families recover the dreams they're losing?
Obama	0	This bill does a great job protecting credit card companies from the few bad apples who try to escape their debt, but what does it do to protect the American public from the credit card companies who try to take advantage of them?
Obama	0	Mr. President, the bankruptcy crisis this bill should address is not just the one facing credit card companies who are enjoying record profits.
Obama	0	We should be addressing middle-class families who are dealing with record hardships.
Obama	0	As Senator Dodd, Senator Feinstein, and others have pointed out, this bill also fails to deal with the aggressive marketing practices and hidden fees credit card companies have used to raise their profits and our debt.
Obama	0	Charging a penalty to consumers who make a late payment on a completely unrelated credit card is just one example of these tactics.
Obama	0	We need to end these practices so that we're making life easier not just for the credit card companies, but for honest, hardworking middle-class families.
Obama	0	And if we're going to crack down on bankruptcy abuse, we should make it clear that we intend to hold the wealthy and the powerful accountable too.
Obama	0	As it is now, this bill makes it easier for a company like Enron who just bilked their employees out of their life savings to declare bankruptcy than for the employees themselves.
Obama	0	In my own state, we even had a mining company by the name of Horizon declare bankruptcy and then refuse to pay its employees the health benefits it owed them.
Obama	0	The Mine Workers involved had provided a total of 100,000 years of service and dedication and sacrifice to this company.
Obama	0	They spent their lives working hard.
Obama	0	They did their part.
Obama	0	But Horizon didn't do its part, and it was allowed to hide behind bankruptcy laws to leave these workers without the care they had earned.
Obama	0	This is wrong.
Obama	0	It's wrong that this bill would make it harder for these unemployed workers to declare bankruptcy, while doing nothing to prevent the bankrupt company that put them there from shirking its responsibility entirely.
Obama	0	What kind of a message does it send when we tell hardworking, middle-class Americans, "You have to be more responsible with your finances, but the corporations you work for can be as irresponsible as they want with theirs"?
Obama	0	We must reform our bankruptcy code so that corporations keep their promises and meet their obligations to their workers.
Obama	0	And while I remain hopeful that our companies want to do the right thing for their workers, doing so should not be a choice - it should be a mandate.
Obama	0	Senator Rockefeller has two amendments to do this that I have co-sponsored and urge my colleagues to support.
Obama	0	One would increase the required payments of wages and employee benefit plans to $15,000 per individual from the current level of $4,925.
Obama	0	And it would also require companies that emerge from bankruptcy to immediately pay each retiree who lost health benefits an amount of cash equal to what a retiree would be expected to have to pay for COBRA coverage for 18 months.
Obama	0	The second amendment would prevent bankruptcy courts from dismissing companies' coal act obligations to pay their workers the benefits they promised them.
Obama	0	These companies made a deal to their mine workers, and they should be forced to honor that deal.
Obama	0	Mr. President, this bill gives us a rare chance to ask ourselves who we're here to protect - who we're here to stand up and speak out for.
Obama	0	We should curb bankruptcy abuse and to demand a measure of personal responsibility from people.
Obama	0	We all want that.
Obama	0	But there are also millions of middle-class families out there who are struggling to get by.
Obama	0	They work hard, they love their children, and they're willing to do anything to give them the best possible shot in life.
Obama	0	And in the ten minutes since I've been talking, about thirty of them have filed for bankruptcy.
Obama	0	We live in a rapidly changing world with an economy that's moving just as fast.
Obama	0	We can't always control this and we can't promise that the changes will always leave everyone better off.
Obama	0	But we can do better than one bankruptcy every nineteen seconds.
Obama	0	We can do better than forcing people to choose between the cost of health care and the cost of college.
Obama	0	We can do better than big corporations using bankruptcy laws to deny health care and benefits to their employees.
Obama	0	And we can give people the basic tools and protections they need to believe that in America, your circumstance is no limit to the success you may achieve and the dreams you may fulfill.
Obama	0	And so, while I cannot support this bill the way it is written, I do look forward to working with my colleagues in amending this bill so that we can still keep that promise alive.
Obama	0	Thank you.
Obama	0	JOHN LEWIS 65TH BIRTHDAY GALA  Monday, February 21, 2005 John Lewis's 65th Birthday Gala Compete Text   Thank you.
Obama	0	It's an honor to be here tonight to celebrate one of the most courageous and compassionate Americans of our time.
Obama	0	Happy Birthday John.
Obama	0	When I was first asked to speak here, I thought to myself, never in a million years would I have guessed that I'd be serving in Congress with John Lewis.
Obama	0	And then I thought, you know, there was once a time when John Lewis might never have guessed that he'd be serving in Congress.
Obama	0	And there was a time not long before that when people might never have guessed that someday, African-Americans would be able to go to the polls, pick up a ballot, make their voice heard, and elect that Congress.
Obama	0	But we can, and I'm here, because people like John Lewis believed.
Obama	0	Because people like John Lewis feared nothing and risked everything for those beliefs.
Obama	0	Because they were willing to spend sleepless nights in lonely jail cells, endure the searing pain of billy clubs cracked against their bones, and face down death simply so that all of us could share equally in the joys of life.
Obama	0	How far we've come because of your courage, John.
Obama	0	How far we've come from the days when the son of sharecroppers would huddle by the radio as the crackle of Dr. King's dreams filled his heart with hope.
Obama	0	He was often forced to leave school to work in the fields and the public library was off-limits to his kind, and yet young John Lewis sought knowledge.
Obama	0	His parents were never the type to complain or try to stir up any trouble, and yet their son sought justice.
Obama	0	And so he organized, even when so many tried to stop his efforts.
Obama	0	He spoke truths, even when they tried to silence his words.
Obama	0	And he marched, even when they tried to knock him down again and again and again.
Obama	0	The road John chose for himself was not easy.
Obama	0	But the road to change never is.
Obama	0	I think it's simple for us to look back forty years and think that it was all so clear then.
Obama	0	That while there may be room for moral ambiguity in the issues we debate today, civil rights was different.
Obama	0	That people generally knew what was right and what was wrong, who the good guys and the bad guys were.
Obama	0	But the moral certainties we now take for granted - that separate can never be equal, that the blessings of liberty enshrined in our Constitution belong to all of us, that our children should be able to go to school together and play together and grow up together - were anything but certain when John Lewis was a boy.
Obama	0	And so there was struggle and sacrifice, discipline and tremendous courage.
Obama	0	And there was the culmination of it all one Sunday afternoon on a bridge in Alabama.
Obama	0	I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day.
Obama	0	Not only John and Hosea Williams leading the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it.
Obama	0	Blacks and whites, teenagers and children, teachers and bankers and shopkeepers - a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom.
Obama	0	And I wonder, where did they find that kind of courage?
Obama	0	When you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gas...when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the Lord for salvation?
Obama	0	Truly, this is the audacity of hope.
Obama	0	But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day - after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them...after all that, they went back to march again.
Obama	0	They marched again.
Obama	0	They crossed the bridge.
Obama	0	They awakened a nation's conscience, and not five months later, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law.
Obama	0	And so it was, in a story as old as our beginnings and as timeless as our hopes, that change came about because the good people of a great nation willed it so.
Obama	0	Thank you, John, for going back.
Obama	0	Thank you for marching again.
Obama	0	Thank you for reminding us that in America, ordinary citizens can somehow find in their hearts the courage to do extraordinary things.
Obama	0	That in the face of the fiercest resistance and the most crushing oppression, one voice can be willing to stand up and say that's wrong and this is right and here's why.
Obama	0	And say it again.
Obama	0	And say it louder.
Obama	0	And keep saying it until other voices join the chorus to sing the songs that set us free.
Obama	0	Today, I'm sure you'll all agree that we have songs left to sing and bridges left to cross.
Obama	0	And if there's anything we can learn from this living saint sitting beside me, it is that change is never easy, but always possible.
Obama	0	That it comes not from violence or militancy or the kind of politics that pits us against each other and plays on our worst fears; but from great discipline and organization, from a strong message of hope, and from the courage to turn against the tide so that the tide eventually may be turned.
Obama	0	Today, we need that courage.
Obama	0	We need the courage to say that it's wrong that one out of every five children is born into poverty in the richest country on Earth.
Obama	0	And it's right to do whatever necessary to provide our children the care and the education they need to live up to their God-given potential.
Obama	0	It's wrong to tell hardworking families who are earning less and paying more in taxes that we can't do anything to help them buy their own home or send their kids to college or care for them when they're sick.
Obama	0	And it's right to expect that if you're willing to work hard in this country of American Dreamers, the sky is the limit on what you can achieve.
Obama	0	It's wrong to tell those brave men and women who are willing to fight and die for this country that when they come home, we may not have room for them at the VA hospitals or the benefits we promised them.
Obama	0	And it's right to always provide the very best care for the very best of America.
Obama	0	My friends, we have not come this far as a people and a nation because we believe that we're better off simply fending for ourselves.
Obama	0	We are here because we believe that all men are created equal, and that we are all connected to each other as one people.
Obama	0	And we need to say that more.
Obama	0	And say it again.
Obama	0	And keep saying it.
Obama	0	And where will our courage come from to speak these truths?
Obama	0	When we stand on our own Edmund Pettus Bridge, what hope will sustain us?
Obama	0	I believe it is the hope of knowing that people like John Lewis have stood on that same bridge and lived to cross it.
Obama	0	For me, this kind of hope often comes from a memory of a trip I took during the campaign.
Obama	0	About a week after the primary, Dick Durbin and I embarked on a nineteen city tour of Southern Illinois.
Obama	0	And one of the towns we went to was a place called Cairo, which, as many of you might know, achieved a certain notoriety during the late 60s and early 70s as having one of the worst racial climates in the country.
Obama	0	You had an active white citizen's council there, you had cross burnings, Jewish families were being harassed, you had segregated schools, race riots, you name it - it was going on in Cairo.
Obama	0	And we're riding down to Cairo and Dick Durbin turns to me and says, "Let me tell you about the first time I went to Cairo.
Obama	0	It was about 30 years ago.
Obama	0	I was 23 years old and Paul Simon, who was Lieutenant Governor at the time, sent me down there to investigate what could be done to improve the racial climate in Cairo."
Obama	0	And Dick tells me how he diligently goes down there and gets picked up by a local resident who takes him to his motel.
Obama	0	And as Dick's getting out of the car, the driver says "excuse me, let me just give you a piece of advice.
Obama	0	Don't use the phone in your motel room because the switchboard operator is a member of the white citizen's council, and they'll report on anything you do."
Obama	0	Well, this obviously makes Dick Durbin upset, but he's a brave young man, so he checks in to his room, unpacks his bags and a few minutes later he hears a knock on the door.
Obama	0	He opens up the door and there's a guy standing there who just stares at Dick for a second, and then says, "What the hell are you doing here?"
Obama	0	and walks away.
Obama	0	Well, now Dick is really feeling concerned and so am I because as he's telling me this story, we're pulling in to Cairo.
Obama	0	So I'm wondering what kind of reception we're going to get.
Obama	0	And we wind our way through the town and we go past the old courthouse, take a turn and suddenly we're in a big parking lot and about 300 people are standing there.
Obama	0	About a fourth of them are black and three fourths are white and they all are about the age where they would have been active participants in the epic struggle that had taken place thirty years earlier.
Obama	0	And as we pull closer, I see something.
Obama	0	All of these people are wearing these little buttons that say "Obama for U.S.
Obama	0	Senate."
Obama	0	And they start smiling.
Obama	0	And they start waving.
Obama	0	And Dick and I looked at each other and didn't have to say a thing.
Obama	0	Because if you told Dick thirty years ago that he - the son of Lithuania immigrants born into very modest means in east St. Louis - would be returning to Cairo as a sitting United States Senator, and that he would have in tow a black guy born in Hawaii with a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas named Barack Obama, no one would have believed it.
Obama	0	But it happened.
Obama	0	And it happened because John Lewis and scores of brave Americans stood on that bridge and lived to cross it.
Obama	0	You know, two weeks after Bloody Sunday, when the march finally reached Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to the crowd of thousands and said "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."
Obama	0	He's right, but you know what?
Obama	0	It doesn't bend on its own.
Obama	0	It bends because we help it bend that way.
Obama	0	Because people like John Lewis and Hosea Williams and Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks and thousands of ordinary Americans with extraordinary courage have helped bend it that way.
Obama	0	And as their examples call out to us from across the generations, we continue to progress as a people because they inspire us to take our own two hands and bend that arc.
Obama	0	Thank you John.
Obama	0	May God Bless you, and may God Bless these United States of America.
Churchill	0	I have come before you to-night for one reason.
Churchill	0	I think it is time that Birmingham should strike another blow in defence of the liberties of Britain.The Metropolis of the Midlands has always been a historic centre from which all the principal steps in the extension and consolidation of democratic government in our country have been driven forward.
Churchill	0	It was so in 1832, in 1867, and in 1885, and now, in 1910, Birmingham is not going to be unworthy of its sires [cries of “No”]; is not going feebly and pusillanimously to allow the rights which they won to be filched away from them.The democratic character of the British Constitution is at stake.
Churchill	0	Some of our friends of the opposite party will say, “How can that be true when all that the House of Lords have done is to invite the electors to pronounce?” It is true for this reason.
Churchill	0	The Tory party arc demanding two great and momentous changes.
Churchill	0	Each is of memorable importance, and both are violently reactionary.First, they ask the nation to agree to the establishment of a protective system, including taxes on bread and meat; and, secondly, they ask that the Lords shall be granted not merely the veto they have used so freely over legislation but a hereditary veto over finance as well.
Churchill	0	I say that both these claims affect the democratic character of our Constitution.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	The House of Lords have no right to touch finance.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Custom, authority, precedent, and usage all forbid it.
Churchill	0	The control of finance by the representative Assembly is the keystone of the constitutional fabric under which we have all dwelt so safely and peacefully all our lives.
Churchill	0	It is by the application of the power of the purse that we have moved forward, slowly and prosaically, no doubt, but without any violent overturning, and have grown from being a small island in the Northern seas to be the centre of a world-wide Empire.It is not merely a question of the rejection of the Budget that we have to discuss [A voice: “We pay taxes,” and a disturbance, during which a woman was removed from the gallery], but the claim of a hereditary Chamber over which you have no control, which may be civil to you if it likes, but which if it chooses to cut up rusty is altogether beyond the reach of your remonstrances the claims of that Assembly to make and unmake Governments.
Churchill	0	The recognition by the country of that claim means that the House of Lords must become the main source and origin of all political power in our country.
Churchill	0	The quarrel is one upon which we had believed the sword had been victoriously sheathed for nearly 300 years.Do not think that these constitutional doctrines are pressed upon you out of mere pedantry.
Churchill	0	They are matters of vital and striking importance to all of you every day.
Churchill	0	Upon your votes hangs your political status as citizens.
Churchill	0	[A voice: “What about the status of women?”] Some day I hope women will have votes too.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	But they will have to adopt another plan to get them.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	If you allow that power of finance upon which alone the reality and strength of the House of Commons depend to be taken away, or to be divided even in the smallest degree, you will have weakened the value of your votes.
Churchill	0	Your votes may remain, but they will be only votes to elect members to an inferior Assembly, much less powerful than now exists, and that involves an immense contraction and diminution in the democratic character of the government of the country.Underneath all political action there is usually a social cause, and there is a deep social cause underlying the present attack on representative Government.
Churchill	0	Workmen are beginning to use the electoral machinery for their own purposes.
Churchill	0	The House of Lords has had an increasingly poor opinion of the House of Commons for a very long time.
Churchill	0	It was bad enough when Catholics and Jews and Dissenters claimed and captured equal political rights.
Churchill	0	It was worse still when pushing, bustling manufacturers from Lancashire and the Midlands shoved their way into the House of Commons and took their seats on the benches by the side of the sons of peers and their nominees.
Churchill	0	But now that small tradesmen and school teachers and trade unionists and co-operators and working engineers and an actual navvy and even one or two avowed Socialists have begun to come into the House of Commons, the opinion of the House of Lords has, I am afraid, sunk to a very low ebb indeed.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.
Churchill	0	]But, gentlemen, you and I here to-night who try to look at the real truth of things see in this process, which is bringing new classes into the governing machinery year by year, the same old process by which we have always grown stronger, more stable, more generous, and more free.?
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.
Churchill	0	]I feel myself offended by the air of aristocratic insolence in which the House of Lords indulge.
Churchill	0	Lord Curzon [prolonged booing] — Lord Curzon quotes a great French agnostic and adopts his phrase: “All civilisations are the work of aristocracies.” [Ironical laughter.]
Churchill	0	It would be much more true to say that the upkeep of aristocracy has been the hard work of all civilisations.
Churchill	0	(Prolonged cheering.
Churchill	0	)You don’t need to be told that thirty years ago there was a Mayor of Birmingham who said with a force and terseness certainly never surpassed all and more than all the doctrines that have been put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and when I hear Lord Curzon say all civilisations are the work of aristocracies I only wish that the Chamberlain of 1885, that proud and famous citizen of Birmingham, were able to deal with these contemptible pretensions as they deserve.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]What does Lord Lansdowne say about old-age pensions?
Churchill	0	He says, “We allowed them to pass.” More than that, he said in a recent speech at Plymouth, “We have allowed a lot of the bills to pass: the Port of London, Labour Exchanges, Small Holdings, the Patents Bill.” We have allowed a lot of them to pass!
Churchill	0	We have given you a lot of rope, you miserable members of the House of Commons!
Churchill	0	Why, we have never thrown out a Budget before this year; we have actually allowed a Radical Government to go on governing the country for four whole years; we have allowed all this, and yet you complain, yet you unreasonable Radicals are not satisfied with all our generosity, all our magnanimity!
Churchill	0	[Laughter.
Churchill	0	]That is their point of view.
Churchill	0	Very often a man shows much more his real inner point of view in a single unguarded phrase which slips out straight from the mint of his mind than he does in the most carefully prepared diplomatic statement or most eloquent peroration.What does it mean—”We allowed them to pass?” It means that the hereditary institution which Lord Lansdowne leads regards all our liberties and political rights as enjoyed and enjoyable only so long as they choose to let us go on having them.
Churchill	0	But once we touch reality, once we touch their interests and privileges [here Churchill kicked the platform vigorously]: “Out!” [Cheers and laughter.
Churchill	0	]I come to you to-night because the need is urgent and the crisis grave, and I ask you all whether we are prepared to hold our liberties on their sufferance.
Churchill	0	[Cries of “No.”]  You have heard the saying, “Freedom broadens slowly down from precedent to precedent.” What we are confronted with now is, “Freedom narrows quickly up from privilege to privilege.” [Cheers.
Churchill	0	]I do not think that we can hold our rights upon the permission and amiable disposition of Lord Lansdowne and his majority.
Churchill	0	I do not recognise that they have any rights against representative persons and elected assemblies.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	The people have the right to vote, and as they vote so the action of the legislature and of the Government should follow.
Churchill	0	We are not a lot of savages and Hottentots in the depths of Africa.
Churchill	0	We are not children in the schools.
Churchill	0	We are the leading community in the civilised world.
Churchill	0	We have taught all nations to fight for freedom.
Churchill	0	We have taught all nations the principles and practice of representative government institutions.
Churchill	0	We require no tutelage.
Churchill	0	If Parliaments are too long, let them be shortened.
Churchill	0	The policy of the Government is that of five-year Parliaments.
Churchill	0	If you think some check or delay is needed upon hasty legislation to prevent anything being done in a single session which might afterwards be regretted, if you think some process of revision by another body differently constituted to the House of Commons is necessary, by all means let there be, within proper limits and under proper conditions of constitution, a Second Chamber.But I stand here to-night on a very simple plan.
Churchill	0	I ask you to stand for the effective supremacy of the House of Commons.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	Your first choice on Saturday is whether you will or will not vote for the supremacy of the House of Commons which you yourselves elect.
Churchill	0	Some people are afraid of the future if the working man gets what he asks.Your forefathers looked out on a world far stormier than any which confronts us now.
Churchill	0	It was darkened with threats of violence and revolution such as we have not known in England now for many years.
Churchill	0	But they pushed steadily ahead towards a broadening of the Constitution on democratic foundations, and we are to-day a richer, happier, and more contented people, enjoying the fruits of their courage and sagacity.Working men’s politics must bulk largely in the affairs of a community which has so many millions of educated working men.
Churchill	0	What would happen if they did not, if working class politics did not receive the attention which they deserve and require?
Churchill	0	An utter break would soon be Created between the governing forces and the great masses of the nation, and it might easily lead to a bloody struggle to restore the shattered balance and integrity of our national life.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]But let us look at the facts of to-day.
Churchill	0	Has democratic government in the last three years—has the attention paid to labour matters—injured industry or credit?
Churchill	0	Let the figures of the last three years be the answer.
Churchill	0	Take the three first complete years of this Government, the most Radical and democratic Government which has ever borne sway in our land [cheers] and compare them with the last three years of the last Conservative Administration.
Churchill	0	Oversea trade, imports and exports, in the last three years of a Conservative Administration amounted to £2,797.000,000.
Churchill	0	During three years of democratic and Liberal Administration that trade amounted to £3,271,000.000, an increase for the period of three years of £474,000,000.
Churchill	0	Take the bankers’ clearing-house returns not an accurate sign of actual prosperity, but an invaluable sign of business activity.
Churchill	0	The amounts cleared in the last three years of Conservative Government—a Government of stability and order [laughter]—were £32,900,000,000—gigantic figures, and we are only asking for a little in the Budget.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	In the first three years of Liberal Government the amount was £37,561,000,000 an excess during our Government over theirs of £4,500.000,000.
Churchill	0	That is leaving out the present year, a record year in respect of banking clearances.
Churchill	0	The grand total for the year is £13,500,000.000, an increase of £1,400,000,000 over last year.
Churchill	0	This is after the Budget [laughter], since the introduction of the Budget which you were told would ruin everything.The hereditary veto of the House of Lords not only over finance but over legislation must be swept away.
Churchill	0	The present agitation is not against the Peers as peers, but against the Peers as hereditary legislators.
Churchill	0	Nor does the Lords’ veto stand alone.
Churchill	0	It has to be considered in conjunction with the other tremendous change which is involved in a reversion to Protection.
Churchill	0	Protection is like dram drinking — it produces a transient exhilaration that is succeeded by other less satisfactory symptoms, and in the cheerless grey of the morning no remedy can be found for the fumes of the previous night’s debauch except another pull at the Protectionist bottle.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.]
Churchill	0	To repeat and increase the dose is the only cure to be suggested.
Churchill	0	It is easy to get into such habits.
Churchill	0	To get free again is a much more painful business.
Churchill	0	[“Hear, hear.”]I would repeat that to all those who ask “Why not give Tariff Reform a chance?” The choice is irrevocable, in your lifetime at any rate.
Churchill	0	Once the fateful step has been taken, retreat is impossible.
Churchill	0	You would have a great network of trusts woven together, joined together on the simple principle of “You scratch my back and I will scratch yours,” all trying to organise themselves to get advantages and favours from the Government, all sitting down to besiege the Government through their millionaire bosses, their political organisations, their multitudes of shareholders, through the working men whose interests would be associated with these selfish trade organisations.
Churchill	0	The whole force of this great network of tariff-fed trusts will be brought to bear on the representatives of the people in the House of Commons.
Churchill	0	If you have at the one end this vast organisation and at the other end the veto of the House of Lords, able to dismiss by a contemptuous gesture any Government, why, they will play battledore and shuttlecock* with your liberties.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.
Churchill	0	]*Not an original Churchillism, but an example of his comprehensive memory: Battledore and Shuttlecock was a racquet game that evolved into Badminton in the mid-1800s.The movement of the Conservative party towards these two great changes for which they seek authority from the nation is curiously timed.
Churchill	0	Their backwash meets in full ebb our onward tide.
Churchill	0	At the very moment when the Tories are attempting to extend the absolute veto of the House of Lords over finance as well as legislation, we have resolved to restrict it in legislation as well as in finance.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	At the very moment when they are forging new chains of monopoly for national industry, we are preparing to break the old chains which oppress the people’s land.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]Mr.
Churchill	0	Chamberlain, of whom I speak with all proper sympathy and respect, is appealing to Birmingham to be true to the traditions of its past.
Churchill	0	[Voice: “I hope we shall.”]  I am content with that.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I was reading again this morning pages in Martineau’s History of the Thirty Years’ Peace, in which the crisis of the great Reform Bill is described.
Churchill	0	The Lords had rejected the Reform Bill.
Churchill	0	It had been passed by the Commons and rejected by the Lords, and a deadlock was created from which it seemed there was no issue except by the creation of peers or civil war.
Churchill	0	There is reason to believe, writes the historian, that what passed at Birmingham immediately determined the issue of this mighty contention.
Churchill	0	A famous meeting of the Birmingham Political Union was held, at which over 150,000 persons were present.
Churchill	0	While the Scots Greys in the Birmingham Barracks were sharpening their swords and  serving out ball ad cartridge, and the Duke of Wellington was preparing to suppress the people by force of arms, the men of Birmingham assembled to the number of 150,000. and rolled out the tremendous hymn of right and freedom:God is our guide!
Churchill	0	From field, from wave.From plough, from anvil, and from loom.We come our country’s rights to save.And speak the tyrant faction’s doom.And.
Churchill	0	hark, we raise from sea to seaThe sacred watchword—Liberty!
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	Let Birmingham be true to the traditions of its past.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Let Birmingham be true, and “it must follow as the night the day, thou can’st not then be false to any man.” [Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	We are met together at a time when great exertions and a high constancy are required from all who cherish and sustain the Liberal cause.
Churchill	0	Difficulties surround us and dangers threaten from this side and from that.
Churchill	0	Exultant enemies are gathering: weak friends are nervous or disheartened.
Churchill	0	Voices are raised in counsels, both equally unwise, of impatience or of lassitude.
Churchill	0	From such a situation you may emerge triumphant, but to do that there will have to be, in leaders and in followers, shrewd clear plans of action, true stout-hearted comradeship, and unwearying determination.
Churchill	0	[Cheers]You know the position which has been created by the action of the House of Lords.
Churchill	0	Two great political parties divide all England between them in their conflicts.
Churchill	0	Each commands a powerful organisation; each is backed by numbers; each has its functions, its aspirations, and its sources of strength; and to and fro they swing in their struggles with varying fortunes from year to year, and from election to election—and from their struggles, strange as it may appear, over a long period of years, a steady stream of progress is born.Now, it is discovered that one of these parties possesses an unfair weapon, that one of these parties, after it is beaten at an election, after it is deprived of the support and confidence of the country, after it is destitute of a majority in the representative Assembly, when it sits in the shades of Opposition without responsibility, or representative authority, under the frown, so to speak, of the Constitution, nevertheless possesses a weapon with which it can harass, vex, impede, affront, humiliate, and finally destroy the most serious labours of the other.When it is realised that the party which possesses this prodigious and unfair advantage is, in the main, the party of the rich against the poor, of the classes and their dependents against the masses, of the lucky, the wealthy, the happy, and the strong against the left-out and the shut-out millions of the weak and poor, you will see how  serious the constitutional situation has become.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]A period of supreme effort lies before you.
Churchill	0	The election with which this Parliament will close, and towards which we are moving, is one which is different in notable features from any other which we have known.
Churchill	0	Looking back over the politics of the last thirty years, we hardly ever see a Conservative Opposition approaching an election without a programme—on paper at any rate—of social and democratic reform.There was Lord Beaconsfield, with his policy of “Health and the laws of health.” There was the Tory democracy of Lord Randolph Churchill in 1885 and 1886, with large far-reaching plans of Liberal and democratic reform, of a generous policy to Ireland, of retrenchment and reduction of expenditure upon naval and military armaments—all promises to the people, and for the sake of which he resigned rather than play them false.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Then you have the elections of 1892 and 1895.
Churchill	0	In each the Conservative party, whether in office or Opposition, was.
Churchill	0	under the powerful influence of Mr. Chamberlain, committed to most extensive social programmes, of what we should call Liberal and Radical reforms, like the Workmen’s Compensation Act and old-age pensions, part of which were carried out by them and part by others.But what social legislation, what plans of reform do the Conservative party offer now to the working people of England if they will return them to power’ I have studied very carefully the speeches of their leaders—if you can call them leaders.
Churchill	0	I have listened frequently to their  contributions to our debates in Parliament, and I have failed to discover a single plan of social reform or reconstruction which they have invented, which they are attached to, or which they have proclaimed.Upon the grim and sombre problems of the Poor Law they have no policy whatever; upon unemployment no policy whatever; for the evils of intemperance no policy whatever, except to make sure of the public-house vote; upon the question of the land, monopolised as it is in the hands of a few, denied to so many, so much of it fooled away for foxes and pheasants, no policy whatever.
Churchill	0	In other directions where they have a policy, it is worse than no policy.
Churchill	0	For the distresses of the Irish, for the relation between the Irish and British peoples, no policy whatever; for Scotland the Lords’ veto; for Wales a Church repugnant to the conscience of the overwhelming majority of the Welsh people, crammed down their throats at their own expense.
Churchill	0	No, I say that never in modern history has the Conservative party approached an election so utterly devoid not only of any published plan, but of any apparent intention or even wish to remedy or to mitigate the grievances, the gross and cruel injustices for the redress of which appeals have so long and so earnestly been made by important classes of their fellow-countrymen.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Yet we are told they are confident of victory [laughter]; they are persuaded that the country has already forgotten the follies and even the crimes of the late Administration, and that the general contempt and disgust in which they Were dismissed from power has already passed away.
Churchill	0	They are already busy making their Cabinet—who is to be put in and what is not less important who is to be put out.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.]
Churchill	0	Lists of selection and lists of proscription are being framed.
Churchill	0	The two factions into which they are divided—the Balfouritcs and the Tariff “Reformers”—are each acutely conscious of one another’s infirmities, and through their respective organs they have succeeded in proving to their apparent satisfaction what most of us have known and some of us have said for a long time past—that they are an uncommon poor lot all round.
Churchill	0	It would be bad enough if a party so destitute, according to its own statement, of political merit, so devoid of new and needful political ideas, were to return untaught, unchastened.
Churchill	0	and unrepentant to the place of power.
Churchill	0	It would be bad enough if they were to return with the intention of doing nothing but repeating and renewing our experiences under Mr. Balfour’s late Administration—of dragging through empty sessions, of sneering at every philanthropic enthusiasm, of flinging a sop from time to time to the brewers or the barons or the landed classes.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	That would be bad enough; but those would not be the consequences which would follow from the Tory triumph.
Churchill	0	Consequences far more grave, immeasurably more disastrous would follow.
Churchill	0	We are not offered an alternative policy of progress; we are not confronted even with a policy of stand-still; we are confronted with an organised policy of constructive reaction.
Churchill	0	We are not to go on.
Churchill	0	We are not even to hold our own.
Churchill	0	We are to march back into those shades from which we had hoped British civilisation and British science had finally emerged.
Churchill	0	Not for many years have the working people of this country been menaced with such an aggressive attack.If the Conservative party win the election, they have made it perfectly clear that it is their intention to impose a complete protective tariff, and to raise the money for ambitious armaments and colonial projects by taxing the poor.
Churchill	0	They have declared, with a frankness which is at any rate remarkable, that they will immediately proceed to put a tax on bread, a tax on meat, a tax on timber, and an innumerable schedule of taxes on all unmanufactured articles imported into the United Kingdom; that is to say that they will take by all these taxes a large sum of money from the pockets of the wage-earners by making them pay more for the food they eat, the houses they live in, and the comforts and conveniences which they require in their homes; and that a great part of this large sum of money will be divided between the landlords and the manufacturers in the shape of increased profits, and even that part of it which does reach the Exchequer is to be given back to these same classes in the shape of reductions in income tax and in direct taxation.Do not allow yourself to be drawn from this plain view of what is called the Tariff “Reform” movement by ingenious sophistries which have often been exposed, by appeals to sentiment of a cheap and false character, or by delusions about taxing the foreigner.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Such treacle is scarcely fit to catch flies with [laughter]—and if you face the policy with which we are now threatened by the Conservative party fairly and searchingly, you will see that, stripped of its disguises and stripped of its ornaments, it is nothing less than a deliberate attempt on the part of important sections of the propertied classes to transfer their existing burdens to the shoulders of the masses of the people, and to gain greater profits for the investment of their capital by charging higher prices.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]It is very natural that a party nourishing such designs should be apprehensive of criticism and of opposition, but I must say I have never heard of a party which was in such a jumpy, nervous state as our opponents are at this present time.
Churchill	0	If one is led in the course of a speech, as I sometimes am [laughter and cheers], to speak a little firmly and bluntly about the Conservative Tariff “Reformers,” they become almost speechless with indignation.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	They are always in a state of incipient political apoplexy, while as for the so-called Liberal Unionists, whenever they are criticised they run off whining and complain that it is unchivalrous to attack them while Mr. Chamberlain is disabled.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.]
Churchill	0	Sorry I am that he is out of the battle, not only on personal but on public grounds.
Churchill	0	His fiercest opponents would welcome his re-entry into the political arena, if only for the fact that we should then have a man to deal with and someone whose statement of the case for his side would be clear and bold, whose speeches would be worth reading and worth answering, instead of the melancholy marionettes whom the wire-pullers of the Tariff Reform League are accustomed to exhibit on provincial platforms.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.
Churchill	0	]But I hope you will not let these pretexts or complaints move you or prevent you from calling a spade a spade, a tax a tax, a protective tariff a gigantic dodge to cheat the poor, or the Liberal Unionist party the most illiberal thing on record.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	But if the Tariff “Reformers” are so touchy and intolerant that they resent the slightest attack or criticism from their opponents as if it were sacrilege, that is nothing to the fury which they exhibit when any of their friends on the Conservative side begin to ask a few questions.Whatever we may think of the Tariff “Reform” proposals which are now being urged upon us, no one can deny that they raise some of the gravest and most momentous social and economic issues which can possibly be brought before the public, and that they involve consequences of the utmost complexity and importance not only to the working classes, but to all concerned in the trade and commerce of our country.
Churchill	0	One would have thought, at least, that matters of such gravity and such novelty should be considered fairly on their merits.
Churchill	0	One would have thought, at least, that conscientious scruples, honest doubts, or differences of view would be accorded some measure of respect.But what does Mr. Austen Chamberlain say?
Churchill	0	I refer to him because I am told he is a very important person.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	He tells us that no hesitation will be tolerated from Unionist members of Parliament in regard to any tariff reform proposals which may in a future Parliament be submitted by whoever may be the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Churchill	0	No hesitation will be tolerated—not opposition, not criticism, not dissent, but no hesitation will be tolerated.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	There is to be no hesitation about a tax on bread, no hesitation will be tolerated about a tax on meat, no hesitation about a tax on timber, butter, cheese, eggs, about a tax on every conceivable article of convenience or of comfort used by the working classes of this country.The members of the Unionist party are to go to the next Parliament, not as honest gentlemen, free to use their minds and intelligences according to the view which they may take at the time of what best suits the public interest.
Churchill	0	No; they are to go as the pledged, tied-up delegates of a caucus, forced to swallow without hesitation details of a tariff which they have not even seen, denied the right which every self-respecting man should claim—which no self-respecting man can surrender—to give their vote on grand and cardinal issues according to their faith and their conscience; and in order that those who would refuse to be bound by these dishonouring conditions may be smelt out and excluded from the House of Commons, a secret society of nameless but probably interested busy-bodies is hard at work in all the dirtiest sewers of political intrigue.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.]
Churchill	0	Such are the methods by which this great and noble policy which is to raise our taxation from the foreigner, to abolish unemployment, and to consolidate the British Empire is being advanced.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]But, after all, these methods are an inseparable part of the process of carrying a Protectionist tariff.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Every interest that is on the side of the new taxation expects to be paid for its trouble and support, and to be paid promptly.
Churchill	0	The whole question resolves itself into a matter of “business is business,” and the predatory interests which have landed themselves together to finance and organise the tariff campaign cannot be expected to put up with the conscientious scruples and reasonable hesitations of members of Parliament or what they would consider any nonsense of that sort.
Churchill	0	It will be a cash transaction throughout with large profits and quick delivery.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.]
Churchill	0	Every would-be monopolist in the country is going to have his own association to run his own particular trade.
Churchill	0	Every constituency will be forced to join in the scramble, and to secure special favours at the expense of the common-wealth for its special branches of industry.
Churchill	0	All the elections of the future will turn on tariffs.
Churchill	0	If the first set of tariffs were framed with some desire to benefit the trade of the country, mistaken though it might be, the second set of tariffs would be framed only for the purpose of enabling a political party to pay its debts to particular sections of its supporters.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Why, you can see the thing beginning already.
Churchill	0	That egregious “Tariff Commission” has been dividing all the loot among themselves, before the battle has been won—dividing the lion’s skin while the beast lives [laughter and cheers]—and I was reading only the other day that the Conservatives of Norwood have decided that they could not support their member any longer, because, forsooth, he would not pledge himself to vote for a special tax on foreign imported chairs and window panes.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	No hesitation can be tolerated in regard to a special tax on chairs and window panes.It is the same in every country.
Churchill	0	I received a report last week at the Board of Trade upon the subject of American tariff revision—and tariff reform in the United States, remember, means a reduction and not an increase of duties in which it was stated that the people in Kansas and Missouri, where there were large mining communities who thought their interests would be affected by the tariff alterations on zinc ore, were singing in chapels a hymn, the refrain of which was:So now we humbly pray that we be saved from ruin’s brink.We will accept whate’er must be, but, Lord, remember zinc.Such is the great conspiracy with which the British democracy is now confronted, a three-fold peril, an attempt to place the main burden of taxation upon the shoulders of wage-earners and not on income-drawers, a disastrous blow at the prosperity, the freedom, the flexibility, and the expansive power of British industry, and a deadly injury to the purity of English public life.
Churchill	0	These will be the consequences, momentous and long enduring, of a tariff victory at the general election; and remember it has been said that it takes ten years to carry a tariff, but it takes a hundred years to abolish it.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Did I not tell you that this would be an election in which the stakes would be high?
Churchill	0	Yes, for our part, let us, too, be plain and clear.
Churchill	0	The Conservative party tell us if they win the victory they will screw a Protective tariff on our necks.
Churchill	0	What do we say?
Churchill	0	What of the House of Lords?
Churchill	0	We say that if we win we will smash to pieces the veto of the House of Lords.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	If we should obtain a majority at the next election—and I have good hopes that if we act with wisdom and with union, and, above all, with courage, we shall undoubtedly obtain an effective majority [cheers]—the prize we shall claim as the result of that victory will be a final change in the relations of the two Houses of Parliament, of such a character as to enable the House of Commons to make its will supreme within the lifetime of a single Parliament, and except upon that basis, or for the express purpose of effecting that change, we will not accept any responsibility for the conduct of affairs.I have spoken to you of the constitutional and economic issues which divide great parties, and which will be brought to the test when the electors are next appealed to.
Churchill	0	But there is another issue which must not be overlooked.
Churchill	0	I mean the social issue.Do not let us in our zeal for the great causes which are at stake in the political and economic field forget the crying, humble needs of the neglected millions of our population.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	We have taken a great step already.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I must say that he is rather a sour kind of man who can find nothing to notice in the Old-age Pensions Act except its little flaws and petty defects.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	How can anybody suppose that such a tremendous departure into ground hitherto entirely unexplored could be taken without here and there some queer cases, some odd cases and hard cases occurring, which of course can easily be put right by a small “mopping up” bill?
Churchill	0	I think you will feel, on the contrary, that the establishment of the pensions system, which sprang into being in a single day, is a marvellous and impressive example of the power which British Governments possess and the mighty machinery which they can set in motion.Without a hitch, without a pause, perfectly smoothly, perfectly simply, punctual to the minute, regular as clockwork, nearly 600,000 aged persons, scattered throughout the length and breadth of the three kingdoms, are being paid their pensions every week, through agencies which are not dishonouring or disqualifying to their citizenship in any way, nor repugnant or wounding to their feelings.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	That is a wonderful and beneficent achievement, a good job well worth some risk and sweat to finish.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	No; in spite of Socialistic sneer and Tory jeer and glorious beer, and all the rest of it, I say it is a noble and inspiring event for which this Parliament will be justly honoured by generations unborn.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]I said just now that a Tory tariff victory meant marching backwards, but  there are some things they cannot undo.
Churchill	0	It is quite true that the Conservative party, through its responsible leaders, promised old-age pensions to the people to win the general election of 1895, and that they broke their promise, although they had ten years of power.
Churchill	0	It is quite true that Mr. Chamberlain offered old-age pensions again to the people at the outset of his tariff campaign in 1903, and that the Conservative party forced that great man at the height of his power to cut old-age pensions out of his tariff programme, and to write a letter to say that he had done so.
Churchill	0	It is quite true that the Conservative party would have destroyed the Old-age Pensions Bill in the House of Commons if they had had the power, and would have destroyed it in the House of Lords if they had had the pluck.
Churchill	0	But the work is done; the pensions are safe.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Governments come and governments go.
Churchill	0	We may be driven from power.
Churchill	0	We may desire to be released from responsibility; our places may be filled by the representatives of wealth and privilege, by the delegates of the Tariff Reform League, by the nominees of the liquor trade.
Churchill	0	Much of our work may be cut short, much may be overturned But there are some things which Tory reaction will not dare to touch, and, like the settlement and reconciliation of South Africa, so the Old-age Pensions Act will live and grow and ripen as the years roll by far beyond the reach of party warfare and far above the changing moods of faction.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]If I thought that this great social measure exhausted our strength or completed our design, I should cheerfully join myself with those ardent spirits who wish for an immediate dissolution.
Churchill	0	But the Old-age Pensions Act must not be the end of the chapter; it must be the beginning of a chapter of social legislation.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	There are many political injustices in this country, and many absurd, oppressive, or obsolete practices.
Churchill	0	But the main aspirations of the British people are at this present time social rather than political.They see around them on every side, and almost every day spectacles of confusion and misery which they cannot reconcile with any conception of humanity or justice.
Churchill	0	They see that this suffering is to a large extent due to lack of organisation, to the absence of good comprehensive arrangements.
Churchill	0	They see that there are in the modern State a score of misfortunes that can happen to a man without his being in fault in any way, and without his being able to guard against them in any way.
Churchill	0	They see men and women falling constantly from a stairway which has no banisters upon which all jostle together without any proper regulation of the traffic, and that when they fall they are often broken, hopelessly and for ever.
Churchill	0	They see, on the other hand, the mighty power of science backed by wealth and power to introduce order, to provide safeguards, to prevent accidents, or at least to mitigate their consequences.They see that much has been done in other countries.
Churchill	0	They know that this country is the richest in the world.
Churchill	0	They wonder why so little has been done here.
Churchill	0	They demand that more shall be done; and in my sincere judgment the British democracy will not give their hearts to any party that is not able and willing to set up that larger fuller more elaborate, more thorough social organisation, without which our country and its people will inevitably sink through sorrow to disaster, and our name and fame fade upon the pages of history.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Now I say that we have done some of that work, and we are going to do more.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	In moving forward in this great struggle which is approaching, we are going to carry our social policy along with us.
Churchill	0	We are not going to fight alone upon the political and constitutional issue, nor alone upon the defence of Free Trade.
Churchill	0	We are going, fearless of the consequences, confident of our faith, to place before the nation a wide, comprehensive, interdependent scheme of social organisation; to place it before the people not merely in the speeches or placards of a party programme, but, by a massive series of legislative proposals and administrative acts.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	If we are interrupted or impeded in our march, the nation will know how to deal with those who stand in the path of vital and necessary reforms.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	And I am confident that in the day of battle the victory will be to the earnest and to the persevering, and then again will be heard the doleful wail of Tory rout and ruin, and the loud and resounding acclamations with which the triumphant armies of democracy will march once again into the central place of power.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	This speech deserves particular attention for it was made during an important period of Churchill’s career and reflects his transition from concentration on foreign affairs to social problems.
Churchill	0	— RRJThis is a great meeting – [hear, hear] – and it augurs well for our cause.
Churchill	0	[Applause.]
Churchill	0	I am very sorry that there is no more room in the hall, because I have seen outside a great many gentlemen – [a Voice – “Why did you not keep the women out?”] – who are electors, and who earnestly desired to be present, but I think the great gathering which is assembled here, which fills this spacious building, is a sign that the Liberal cause has behind it the driving power that is necessary for victory.
Churchill	0	[Applause.]
Churchill	0	And, gentlemen, this election is one of special and peculiar importance.
Churchill	0	We meet together to take a decision which will be judged by the whole country.[Applause.]
Churchill	0	You will have many votes to cast in your lives, but I think it is no exaggeration to say that the vote which you will cast on Saturday will be probably the most important vote which as citizens of Dundee you will have to record.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	Don’t let it be wasted.
Churchill	0	Don’t let it be misapplied.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	Let it go to support the good old cause and strengthen the hands of the Government now doing good work.
Churchill	0	Let it be a solid vote a vote which makes its effect felt, not only on the politics of the day but on the whole politics of this island in which we live for the year or two years to come.A new Government has come into being under a Prime Minster who, like his predecessor whose loss we all profoundly deplore, and whose many virtues all parties have joined to celebrate – a new Prime Minister has come into power, tied to Scotland by strong and intimate bonds.
Churchill	0	Give him a fair chance.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	Give the Government which he has brought into being the opportunity of handling the great machinery of State.
Churchill	0	Be assured that, if you do, they will employ it for the greatest good of the greatest number.
Churchill	0	I am well satisfied at what has taken place in the last four or five days since I have been in Dundee.
Churchill	0	I see a great concentration of forces throughout the constituency.
Churchill	0	I see the opportunity of retrieving, and more than retrieving, the injury which has been done to the cause of progress and reform by elections in other parts of our land.
Churchill	0	[Applause.
Churchill	0	]Ah, but, gentlemen, a very sad thing has happened; an awful thing has happened – [a Voice – “Ringing the bell”] – the Liberal party has gone in for Home Rule.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	The “Scotsman” is shocked, the “Times” is speechless, and takes three columns to express its speechlessness in; the “Spectator,” that staid old weekly, has wobbled back to where it never should have wobbled from [applause and laughter]?the Ulster Unionists declare that the Government has forfeited all the confidence that they never had in it – [laughter] – and thousands of people who never under any circumstances voted Liberal before are saying that under no circumstances will they ever vote Liberal again.
Churchill	0	And I am supposed to be responsible for this revolution in our policy.Why, gentlemen, the statements I have made on the Irish question are the logical and inevitable conclusion of the resolution which was passed by the House of Commons, in which every member of the Government voted, which was carried by an enormous majority – more than 200 – a month or five weeks ago – a resolution which, after explaining the plain and lamentable evils which can be traced to the existing system of government in Ireland, affirmed that the remedy for these evils would be found in a representative body with an Executive responsible to it, subject to The supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament [Cheers.]
Churchill	0	The Irish question at the present time occupies a vastly different position to what it did in the year 1886.
Churchill	0	Ever since 1880 the attention of Parliament has been devoted constantly to Ireland, and the attention of Parliament, when devoted constantly to one object, is rarely fruitless.
Churchill	0	The 25 or 26 years that have passed have seen great changes in Ireland, and I think that time has largely vindicated the action which Mr. Gladstone took in 1886.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	We have seen a great scheme of local government, which Lord Salisbury said would be more disastrous than Home Rule itself, actually put into force.
Churchill	0	We have seen the land policy in Ireland, the scheme of land purchase which in the year 1886 did more to injure the Home Rule Bill than anything else – we have seen that policy actually carried, not to a complete conclusion, but carried into practical effect by a Unionist Administration.These are great events, and their consequences, I think, ought to encourage us to move forward – [hear, hear] not to lead us to move back.
Churchill	0	They have produced results in Ireland which are good and beneficent results, and the Irish question no longer presents itself in the tragic guise of the early eighties.
Churchill	0	They have produced an effect on England too.
Churchill	0	All over our country people have seen Bills which they were told beforehand would be ruinous to the unity and integrity of the United Kingdom – Land Bills and Local Government Bills passed into law, and so far from the dire consequences which were apprehended from these measures, they have found – you here have found – that great good has resulted from that legislation.
Churchill	0	People are encouraged by what has taken place to exert themselves to make a step forward in the future, and I think if we need or look for any further encouragement we should find it in the great success, the great and undisputed triumph which under the mercy of Heaven has attended our policy in South Africa.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	It has resulted in bringing into the circle of the British Empire a grand and martial race, which a foolish policy might easily have estranged for ever.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Ladies and gentlemen, the Irish polity finds its fellow nowhere in the world.
Churchill	0	It is a Government responsible neither to King nor people.
Churchill	0	It is not a democratic Government, not an autocratic Government, nor even an oligarchical Government.
Churchill	0	It is a Government overridden by 41 administrative Boards whose functions overlap one another and sometimes conflict with one another.
Churchill	0	Some are fed with money from the Consolidated Fund, some are supplied by vote of the House of Commons, some are supplied from savings from the Irish Development grant.
Churchill	0	Some of these Boards are under the Viceroy, some under the Chief Secretary, some under Treasury control, and some are under no control at all.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.
Churchill	0	]You have an administration resulting from that system costly, inefficient, unhandy beyond all description.
Churchill	0	You have a mighty staff of officials and police; a people desperately poor; you have taxation which rises automatically with every increase in the expenditure of this vast and wealthy island.
Churchill	0	You have a population which dwindles year by year – terribly and tragically dwindles.
Churchill	0	Add to all this a loyalist caste.
Churchill	0	What an old man of the sea that is to get on the back of any country!
Churchill	0	– a class of people apart from the feelings of the mass of those in the land in which they live looking for their support, not to the people but to external force derived from across the sea.
Churchill	0	You have in effect in Ireland at the present time almost exactly the same situation which would have grown up in South Africaif we had not had the wit and the nerve to prevent it by bold and daring treatment of the question.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	Take the whole of this situation as I have described it.
Churchill	0	Thrust it into the arena of British politics to be the centre of contending factions, thrust it into our turbulent arena here at home, and the panorama of Irish Government is complete.With these facts before us, upon the authority of men like Lord Dunraven, SirJoseph West Ridgeway, Sir Anthony MacDonnell, Lord Dudley, and others who have served the Crown in Ireland – is it wonderful that we should refuse to turn our eyes away from the vision of that other Ireland, that Ireland free to control her own destiny in all that properly concerns herself; free to devote the native genius of her people to the purposes of her own self-culture, the vision of that other Ireland which Mr. Gladstone had reserved as the culminating achievement of his long and glorious career?
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Is it wonderful that we should refuse to turn our eyes away from that?
Churchill	0	No, I say that the desire and the aim of making a national settlement with Ireland on lines which would enable the people of that country to manage their own purely local affairs is not an aim that can be separated from the general march of the Liberal army.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]If I come forward on your platform here at Dundee it is on the clear understanding that I do not preclude myself from doing something to try to reconcile Ireland to England on a basis of freedom and justice.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I said just now that this was an important election.
Churchill	0	Yes, the effect upon His Majesty’s Government and upon the Liberal party for good or ill from this election cannot fail to be great and far-reaching.
Churchill	0	There are strong forces against us.
Churchill	0	Do not underrate the growing strength of the Tory reaction now in progress in many of the constituencies in England.
Churchill	0	I say it earnestly to those who are members of the Labour   party here today – do not underrate the storm which is gathering over your heads as well as ours.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear, and cheers.]
Churchill	0	But I am not afraid of the forces which are against us.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	With your support we shall overwhelm them – with your support we shall beat them down.
Churchill	0	Ah, but we must have that support.
Churchill	0	– [Cheers, and a voice – “2300.”]It is not the enemy in front that I fear, but the division which too often makes itself manifest in progressive ranks – it is that division, that dispersion of forces, that internecine struggle in the moments of great emergency, in the moments when the issue hangs in the balance – it is that division which, I fear, may weaken our efforts and may perhaps deprive us of success otherwise within our grasp.There are cross-currents in this election.
Churchill	0	You cannot be unconscious of that.
Churchill	0	They flow this way and that way, and they disturb the clear issue which we should like to establish between the general bodies of those whose desire it is to move forward on the lines of modern civilization and those who wish to revert to the old and barbarous prejudices and contentions of the past to their fiscal systems and to their methods of government and administration, and to their Jingo foreign policies across the seas, from which we hoped we had shaken ourselves clear.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]I want tonight to speak about three cross-currents, and let me first say a word about Socialism.
Churchill	0	There are a great many Socialists whose opinions and whose views I have the greatest respect for – [hear, hear] – men some of whom I know well, and whose friendship I have the honour to enjoy.
Churchill	0	A good many of those gentlemen who have these delightful, rosy views of a great and brilliant future to the world are so remote from hard facts of daily life and of ordinary politics that I am not very sure that they will bring any useful or effective influence to bear upon the immediate course of events.
Churchill	0	I am dealing rather with those of violent and extreme views who call themselves Socialists in the next few observations I shall venture with your indulgence to address to you.To the revolutionary Socialist I do not appeal as the Liberal candidate for Dundee.
Churchill	0	I recognise that they are perfectly right in voting against me and voting against the Liberals, because Liberalism is not Socialism, and never will be.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]There is a great gulf fixed.
Churchill	0	It is not only a gulf of method, it is a gulf of principle.
Churchill	0	There are many steps we have to take which our Socialist opponents or friends, whichever they like to call themselves, will have to take with us; but there are immense differences of principle and of political philosophy between the views we put forward and the views they put forward.Liberalism has its own history and its own tradition.
Churchill	0	Socialism has its own formulas and its own aims.
Churchill	0	Socialism seeks to pull down wealth; Liberalism seeks to raise up poverty.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	Socialism would destroy private interests; Liberalism would preserve private interests in the only way in which they can be safely and justly preserved, namely, by reconciling them with public right.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Socialism would kill enterprise; Liberalism would rescue enterprise from the trammels of privilege and preference.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Socialism assails the pre-eminence of the individual; Liberalism seeks, and shall seek more in the future, to build up a minimum standard for the mass.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Socialism exalts the rule; Liberalism exalts the man.
Churchill	0	Socialism attacks capital; Liberalism attacks monopoly.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	These are the great distinctions which I draw, and which, I think, you will think I am right in drawing at this election between our philosophies and our ideals.
Churchill	0	Don’t think that Liberalism is a faith that is played out; that it is a philosophy to which there is no expanding future.
Churchill	0	As long as the world rolls round Liberalism will have its part to play – a grand, beneficent, and ameliorating part to play – in relation to men and States.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Ah, gentlemen, I don’t want to embark on bitter or harsh controversy, but I think the exalted ideal of the Socialists – a universal brotherhood, owning all things in common – is not always supported by the evidence of their practice.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	They put before us a creed of universal self-sacrifice.
Churchill	0	They preach it in the language of spite and envy, of hatred, and all uncharitableness.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	They tell us that we should dwell together in unity and comradeship.
Churchill	0	They are themselves split into twenty obscure factions, who hate and abuse each other more than they hate and abuse us.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear, and laughter.]
Churchill	0	They wish to reconstruct the world.
Churchill	0	They begin by leaving out human nature.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	Consider how barren a philosophy is the creed of absolute Collectivism.
Churchill	0	Equality of reward, irrespective of service rendered!
Churchill	0	It is expressed in other ways.
Churchill	0	You know the phrase – “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.” [Laughter.]
Churchill	0	How nice that sounds.
Churchill	0	Let me put it another way – “You shall work according to your fancy; you shall be paid according to your appetite.” [Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Although I have tried my very best to understand these propositions, I have never been able to imagine the mechanical heart in the Socialist world which is to replace the ordinary human heart that palpitates in our breasts.
Churchill	0	What motive is to induce the men, not for a day, or an hour, or a year, but for all their lives, to make a supreme sacrifice of their individuality?
Churchill	0	What motive is to induce the Scotsmen who spread all over the world and make their way by various paths to eminence and power in every land and climate to make the great and supreme sacrifice of their individuality?
Churchill	0	I have heard of loyalty to a Sovereign.
Churchill	0	We have heard of love of country.
Churchill	0	Ah, but it is to be a great cosmopolitan, republic.
Churchill	0	We have heard of love of family and wives and children.
Churchill	0	These are the mere weaknesses of the bad era in which we live.
Churchill	0	We have heard of faith in a world beyond this when all its transitory pleasures and perils shall have passed away, a hope that carries serene consolation to the heart of men.
Churchill	0	Ah, but they deny its existence.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	And what then are we to make this sacrifice for?
Churchill	0	It is for the sake of society.And what is society?
Churchill	0	I will tell you what society is.
Churchill	0	Translated into concrete terms, Socialistic “society” is a set of disagreeable individuals who obtained a majority for their caucus at some recent election, and whose officials in consequence would look on humanity through innumerable grills and pigeon-holes and across innumerable counters, and say to them, “Tickets, please.” [Laughter.]
Churchill	0	Truly this grey old world has never seen so grim a joke.
Churchill	0	[Applause.]
Churchill	0	Now, ladies and gentlemen, no man can be either a collectivist or an individualist.
Churchill	0	He must be both; everybody must be both a collectivist and an individualist.
Churchill	0	For certain of our affairs we must have our arrangements in common.
Churchill	0	Others we must have sacredly individual and to ourselves.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]We have many good things in common.
Churchill	0	You have the police, the army, the navy, and officials – why, a President of the Board of Trade you have in common.
Churchill	0	[Applause.]
Churchill	0	But we don’t eat in common; we eat individually.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	And we don’t ask the ladies to marry us in common.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.
Churchill	0	]And you will find the truth lies in these matters, as it always lies in difficult matters, midway between extreme formulae.
Churchill	0	It is in the nice adjustment of the respective ideas of collectivism and individualism that the problem of the world and the solution of that problem lie in the years to come.
Churchill	0	[Applause.]
Churchill	0	But I have no hesitation in saying that I am on the side of those who think that a greater collective element should be introduced into the State and municipalities.
Churchill	0	I should like to see the State undertaking new functions, particularly stepping forward into those spheres of activity which are governed by an element of monopoly.
Churchill	0	[Applause.]
Churchill	0	Your tramways and so on; your great public works, which are of a monopolistic and privileged character there I see a wide field for State enterprise to embark upon.
Churchill	0	But when we are told to exalt and admire a philosophy which destroys individualism and seeks to replace it by collectivism, I say that is a monstrous and imbecile conception which can find no real foothold in the brains and hearts – and the hearts are as trustworthy as the brains – in the hearts of sensible people.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.
Churchill	0	]I make my respectful acknowledgement to those here who are strong supporters of the Socialistic creed for the courtesy and patience with which they have listened to some observations to which they may not possibly agree.
Churchill	0	But I pass over the convinced Socialists, who, I admit, if they feel inclined, are justified in throwing away their votes on Saturday next – [laughter] – and I come to the Labour influence – the Labour element – the Trades Union element in our midst.
Churchill	0	There I have one or two words to say of a rather straight character, if you don’t object, and which, I hope, will be taken in good part, and will be studied and examined seriously.
Churchill	0	[Applause.]
Churchill	0	Now, Labour in Britainis not Socialism.
Churchill	0	It is quite true that the Socialistic element has imposed a complexion on Labour, rather against its will, and has been largely supported in its actions by funds almost entirely supplied by Trade Unions.
Churchill	0	But Trade Unions are not Socialistic.
Churchill	0	They are the antithesis of Socialism.
Churchill	0	They are undoubtedly individualistic organisations, more in the character of the old Guilds, and much more in the direction of the culture of the individual, than they are in that of the smooth and bloodless uniformity of the masses.Now, the Trade Unions are the most respectable and the most powerful element in the labour world.
Churchill	0	They are the bulwarks of our industrial system.
Churchill	0	They are the necessary guard-rails and bulwarks of a highly-competitive industrial system, and I have the right, as a member of His Majesty’s Government, to speak with good confidence to Trade Unionists, because we have done more for Trade Unionists than any other Government that has ever been.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	We have given them a charter.By the judicial decisions of 10 years Trade Unions had been displaced from the position which they had been intended to occupy by a Liberal Administration in 1870, and under a Conservative Administration in 1874 and 1876.
Churchill	0	We have given them back that position in the Trades Disputes Bill, and I do not doubt we have been attacked and penalised in the country by those who disapprove of that measure inconsequence of what we have done.
Churchill	0	And I say to the Trade Unionists, many of whom support the Government on all occasions – all of whom support the Government on 99 occasions out of 100, according to Mr. Shackleton, one of the most respected leaders of the Labour party – it is to the Trade Union element in Labour that I now venture to address myself.
Churchill	0	How stands the case of the Trades Unionists?
Churchill	0	Do they really believe – I put this question to them fairly – do they really believe that there is no difference whatever between a Tory and a Liberal Government?
Churchill	0	[A Voice- “None.”] One gentlemen in this great gathering believes that there is no difference between a Tory and a Liberal Government.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.
Churchill	0	]Now, his cure is simple.
Churchill	0	He has only to listen to Sir George Baxter.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	The Unionist candidate is quite capable of telling him of the difference between a Tory and a Liberal Government.
Churchill	0	Do Trade Unionists really desire the downfall of the existing Liberal Government?
Churchill	0	Would they really like to send a message of encouragement to the House of Lords-for that is what it comes to-to reject and mutilate Liberal and Radical legislation-and Labour legislation now before Parliament?
Churchill	0	Would they really send such a message of encouragement to the House of Lords as this – “House of Lords, you were right in your estimate of public opinion when you denied the extension of the Provision of Meals to School Children Bill to Scotland, when you threw out the Scottish Land Valuation Bill, when you threw out the Scottish Small Holders Bill – when you did all this you were right.” Do you wish to send that message to the House of Lords?
Churchill	0	[Cries of “No.”] But that will be the consequence of every vote subtracted from the Liberal majority.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.
Churchill	0	]Well, it may be said, what we think about is not so much politics as Labour representation.
Churchill	0	Let me look at that?
Churchill	0	Is their claim really a just one at the present moment?
Churchill	0	[“No,” and cheers.]
Churchill	0	After all, 9000 Radical and Liberal votes were cast for my esteemed and respected friend, your late member, Mr. Edmund Robertson.
Churchill	0	It is no longer a question of whether the Labourist element in this city should find effective representation in the House of Commons.
Churchill	0	They have representation in the very capable and well qualified member, Mr. Wilkie.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	It is no longer a question whether they should have representation, but it is a question of whether they will deny to the great majority of the citizens of this important city of Dundee the right to return a representative of their own.
Churchill	0	[Great cheering.]
Churchill	0	When I am told that the campaign on which they are now embarked is destined to further the cause of Labour representation I should like to say – Ask Labour representatives who sit for double-barrelled constituencies in England or Scotland whether they really think the cause of Labour representation is advanced or retarded by so wanton and so reckless an escapade as what we are now witnessing.Why, gentlemen, let me return to the general current of events.
Churchill	0	What is the Government doing at present, and what has it done in its brief existence?
Churchill	0	Within the limits under which it works, and under the present authority of the House of Lords, what has it done and what is it doing for Trade Unionists?
Churchill	0	It has passed the Trades Disputes Act.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	The Workmen’s Compensation Act has extended the benefits of compensation to six million persons not affected by previous legislation.
Churchill	0	The qualification of Justices of the Peace – the citizens’ Privy Councillorship, as I call it – [laughter and cheers] – has been reduced so as to make it more easy for persons not possessed of this world’s goods to qualify to take their places on the civic Bench.
Churchill	0	You know the land legislation for England, which is designed to secure to the suitable man who wants a small parcel of land to cultivate for his own profit and advantage – it secures to that man that he shall not be prevented from obtaining it by feudal legislation, by old legal formalities or class prejudice.
Churchill	0	And is the Licensing Bill not well worth a good blow struck, and struck now while the iron is hot?
Churchill	0	[Great cheers.
Churchill	0	]Then there is the Mines Eight Hours Bill, a measure that has been advocated by the miners for 20 years, and justified by the highest medical testimony on humanitarian and hygienic grounds.
Churchill	0	It is costing us votes and support.
Churchill	0	It is costing us bye-elections, yet it is being driven through.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	Have we not a right to claim the support of The Trades Unionists who are associated with the miners?
Churchill	0	Don’t they feel that this measure is hanging in the balance, not in the House of Commons?
Churchill	0	No, we shall run it through the House of Commons – [cheers] – but it is hanging in the balance in the House of Lords, which attaches to bye-elections an importance which in their arrogant assertion entitles them to mutilate or reject legislation even although it comes to them by the majority of a Parliament elected on a suffrage of six millions.
Churchill	0	Then there is the question of old age pensions, a question that has been much misused and mishandled in the past, and one which ought not to be used for the purpose of obtaining votes.[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]It was taken up by us in fulfilment of pledges given by our opponents to win the election of 1895, and after the lapse of 13 years of toil and stress the Liberal party is able to take it up, and will implement it in an effective fashion.
Churchill	0	Now, is there one of all these subjects which does not command – which ought not to command – the support of Trade Unionists and responsible Labour leaders?
Churchill	0	The Government is fighting for these measures.
Churchill	0	The Government is risking its life and power for these and similar objects.
Churchill	0	The Tory party is opposing it on every point.
Churchill	0	The Tory party is gaining popularity – [“No, no”] – from the interests which are affected by the passing of such measures of social reform.
Churchill	0	The House of Lords is the weapon of the Tory party.
Churchill	0	With that weapon they can make a Liberal Government look ridiculous.
Churchill	0	Are the Labour leaders, are the Trade Unionists, confronted as they are with the menace of reaction, deliberately to throw in their lot with the House of Lords?
Churchill	0	I don’t think they will, in their consciences and in their hearts, when they apply their minds to the existing situation.
Churchill	0	No!
Churchill	0	I say the record I have read out to you of useful legislation in the existence of the present Government is a record which deserves and will, I believe, command the support of the great masses of the labouring classes of our country.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]But I say, in all seriousness, that if the Liberal Government is on the one hand confronted by the House of Lords, fortified by sporadic bye-elections, and on the other hand is attacked, abused, derided by those for whom it is fighting, then that Government, whatever its hopes, whatever its energies, whatever its strength, will be weakened, will perhaps succumb, and will be replaced by another Government.
Churchill	0	And by what other Government will it be replaced?
Churchill	0	The only possible result of such division of the progressive forces – the wanton division of the progressive forces as I see at this election, and as I saw at the Manchester election, where a candidate who had no chance whatever was put in the field simply in order to queer the pitch, simply in order to distract a few votes to give the Tory a chance.
Churchill	0	There can be no other result, I say, from such a division of progressive forces than to instal a Tory and Conservative Government in power.Liberalism will not be killed.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Liberalism is a quickening spirit – it is immortal.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	It will live on through all the days, be they good days or be they evil days.
Churchill	0	No, I believe it will even burn stronger and brighter and more helpful in evil days than in good – [cheers] just like your harbour lights which shine out across the waters, and which on a calm night gleam with soft refulgence, but through the storm flash a message of life to those who toil on the rough waters.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	But it takes a great party to govern Great Britain – no clique, no faction, no cabal, can govern the 40 millions of people who live in this island.
Churchill	0	It takes a great concentration of forces to make a governing instrument.You have now got a Radical and democratic governing instrument, and if this Administration is broken that instrument will be shattered.
Churchill	0	It has been re-created painfully and laboriously after 20 years of courage and fidelity.
Churchill	0	It has come into being – it is there.
Churchill	0	It is now at work in legislation and in the influence which it can exercise throughout the whole world, making even our opponents talk our language [laughter] – making all parties in the State think of social reform, and concern themselves with social and domestic affairs.
Churchill	0	I say, beware of how you injure that instrument – that great instrument as Mr. Gladstone called it – or weaken it at a moment when I think the masses of this country have great need of it.
Churchill	0	Why, what would happen if this present Government were to perish?
Churchill	0	On its tomb would be written – “Beware of social reform.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	The working classes – the labour forces will not support a Government engaged in social reform.
Churchill	0	Every social reform will cost you votes.
Churchill	0	Beware of social reform.
Churchill	0	Learn to think Imperially.” [Great laughter and tremendous cheering.
Churchill	0	]An inconclusive verdict from Dundee, the home of Scottish Radicalism – [hear, hear] an inconclusive or, still more, a disastrous verdict – [loud cries of “No” and “Never”] would carry a message of despair to every one in all parts of our island and in our sister island who is working for the essential influences and truths of Liberalism and progress.
Churchill	0	Down, down, down would fall the high hopes and elevated aspirations of the social reformer.
Churchill	0	The constructive plans now forming in so many nimble brains would melt into air -the light which had begun to gleam over the mountains would fade and die.
Churchill	0	The old regime would be reinstated, reinstalled; the Balfours and the Chamberlains, the Arnold-Forsters and the Lansdownes, and the Cecils will return.
Churchill	0	Like the Bourbons they will have learned nothing and will have forgotten nothing.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	We shall step out of the period of adventurous hope in which we have lived for a brief spell – we shall step back to the period of obstinate and prejudiced negations.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	For Ireland ten years of resolute government; for England dear food and cheaper gin – [great laughter] – and for Scotland – the superior wisdom of the House of Lords.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	Is that the work you want to do, men of Dundee?
Churchill	0	[Loud cries of “No, no.”] Is that the work to which you will put your precious franchises – your votes which have been won for you by so much exertion and struggle in the past?
Churchill	0	Is that the work you want to do on Saturday?
Churchill	0	No, I think not.
Churchill	0	I have a great confidence that the message you will send will be to encourage different work to that.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear, and cheers.
Churchill	0	]I am confident that this city which has of its own free will plunged into the very centre of national politics will grasp the opportunity now presented – that its command will not be back but forward-[loud cheers] that its counsel will be not timidity but courage, and that it will aim not at dividing but at rallying the progressive forces, not at dissipating but at combining the energies of reform.
Churchill	0	That will be the message which you will send in tones which no man can make [cheers] – so that a keen, strong northern air shall sweep across our land to nerve and brace the hearts of men, to encourage the weak, to fortify the strong, to uplift the generous, to correct the proud.
Churchill	0	When an action has been joined for a long time, and the lines are locked in fierce conflict, and stragglers are coming in and the wounded drifting away, when the reserves begin to waver here and there, it is on such an occasion that Scottish regiments have so often won distinction; it is on these occasions that you have seen some valiant brigade march straight forward into the battle smoke, into the confusion of the battlefield, right into the heart of the fight.
Churchill	0	That is what you have to do at this moment.
Churchill	0	“Scotland to the front.”Now I turn my argument to the other side of the field, to the other quarter, from which we in this hall [for I think we are all pretty well agreed] are subject to attack – I turn in my appeal from Trade Unionists, from the Labour men, who ought in all fairness to recognise the work this Government is doing and back them in their sore struggle – I turn to the rich and the powerful, the Unionist and the Conservative elements, who nevertheless upon Free Trade, upon temperance, and upon other questions of moral enlightenment, feel a considerable sympathy with the Liberal party – I turn to those who say “We like Free Trade and we are Liberals at heart, but this Government is too Radical, we don’t like its Radical measures, why can’t they let well alone, what do they mean by introducing all these measures, all these Bills, which disturb credit and trade and interfere with the course of business and cause so many class struggles in the country”?
Churchill	0	– I turn to those who say that, who say we are too Radical in this and in that, and that we are moving too quickly, and I say to them – Look at this political situation, not as party men, but as Britons; look at it in the light of history, look at it in the light of philosophy, and look at it in the light of broadminded Christian charity.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Why is it that life and property are more secure in Britain than in any other country in the world?
Churchill	0	Why is it that our credit is so high and that our commerce stretches so far?
Churchill	0	Is it because of the repressive laws which we impose?
Churchill	0	Why, gentlemen, there are laws far more severe than any prevailing in this country or that have prevailed here for many years now in force in great States in Europe, and yet there is no security of life and property for all these repressive laws.[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Is it because of the House of Lords that life and property is secure?
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	Why, orders of aristocracy more powerful, much more homogeneous, of greater privileges, acting with much greater energy than our aristocracy, have been swept away in other countries until not a vestige, or scarce a vestige, of their existence remains.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	Is it because of the British Constitution that life and property are so secure?
Churchill	0	Why, the British Constitution is mainly British common-sense.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	There were never 40 millions of people dwelling together who had less of an arbitrary and rigid Constitution than we have here.The Constitution of France, the Constitution of Germany, the Constitution of the United States, are far more rigid, far more fortified against popular movements, than the Constitution under which we in these islands have moved steadily forward abreast of the centuries to a better state than any other country.
Churchill	0	I will tell those wealthy and powerful people what the secret of the security of life and property in Britain is.
Churchill	0	The security arises from the continuation of that very class struggle which they lament and of which they complain, which goes on ceaselessly in our country, which goes on tirelessly, with perpetual friction, a struggle between class and class in this country, which never sinks into lethargy, and never breaks into violence, but which from year to year makes a steady and constant advance.
Churchill	0	It is on that class struggle that the security of life and property in our country is fundamentally reposed.We are always changing; like nature we change a great deal, although we change always very slowly.
Churchill	0	We always change, and consequently we are always reaching a higher level after each change, but yet with the harmony of our life unbroken and unimpaired.
Churchill	0	And I say also to those persons here, to whom I now make my appeal – wealthy men, men of light and leading have never been all on one side in our country.
Churchill	0	There have always been men of power and position who have sacrificed and exerted themselves in the popular cause, and that is why there is so little class hatred in our land in spite of all the squalor and misery which we see around us There, gentlemen, lies the true evolution of democracy.
Churchill	0	That is how we have preserved the golden thread of historical continuity when so many other nations have lost it for ever.
Churchill	0	That is the only way in which your island life as you know it, and love it, can be preserved in all its grace and in all its freedom, can be elevated, expanded, and illumined for those who will occupy our places when our share in the world’s work is done.
Churchill	0	[Applause.
Churchill	0	]And I appeal to the leaders of industry and of learning in this city to range themselves on the side of a policy which will vigilantly seek the welfare of the masses, and which will strictly refuse to profit to their detriment, and, in spite of the violence of extremists, in spite of the harshness of controversy which hard conditions produces, in spite of the forces which may seem to those gentlemen ungrateful, I ask them to pursue and preserve in their crusade – for it is a crusade – of social progress and advance.[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Cologne Cathedral took 600 years to build.
Churchill	0	Generations of architects and children lived and died while the work was still in progress.
Churchill	0	Still the work went on.
Churchill	0	Sometimes a generation built wrongly, and the next generation had to unbuild, and the next generation had to build again.
Churchill	0	Still the work went on through all the centuries till at last there stood forth to the world a mighty monument of beauty and of truth to command the admiration and inspire the reverence of mankind.So let it be with the British Commonwealth.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Let us build wisely, let us build surely, let us build faithfully, let us build not for the moment, but for the years that are to come, and so establish here below what we hope to find above – a house of many mansions, where there shall be room for all.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	This speech, which lasted for more than one and a half hours, was described by The Times as “one of the most powerful and brilliant he has made.” —RRJWe are met to consider a very momentous question – whether the name of the great Free-trade Hall is to be altered, and whether the statue of Sir Robert Peel is to be pulled down and replaced by the statue of Sir Howard Vincent.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	All last week the House of Commons was engaged in discussing this matter, and although our debate was robbed of some of its animation through the regrettable absence of the two principal protagonists of Protection, I do not think any Free-trader can feel much dissatisfaction either with the course of the debate or with its result.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Only a month ago the Chancellor of the Exchequer [laughter], I think it more complimentary if I allude to him by his title than by his name [laughter], told the electors of Stalybridge that although the Unionist Free-traders might make a great splash in the autumn campaign in the country they would be put in their proper places as soon as Parliament met.
Churchill	0	But what happened!
Churchill	0	We went to Parliament to find the great Protectionist party-the party that was sweeping the country, only the country did not know it [laughter], and what did we find!
Churchill	0	We found that Tariff Reformers whose eloquence had been so much praised, whose rhetoric was so convincing, were such powerful orators that when they rose to address the House of Commons the members hurried out of the Chamber by the nearest way.[Laughter.
Churchill	0	]We found a number of very respectable gentlemen, with unsettled convictions [laughter] and still more unsettled constituencies [great laughter and cheers], looking extremely foolish, and extremely ashamed of themselves and of the Government [laughter], but perfectly prepared to back the Government up through thick and thin.
Churchill	0	We found Ministers alternately prostrating themselves before the opposing deities of Free Trade and Protection, at one moment proudly and even arrogantly demanding a mandate for tariff reform in the name of the Empire, and the next moment trying to wheedle a few Unionist Free-traders into their lobby by explaining, after all, that all they wanted to do was to resume our liberty of negotiation subject to the consent of the House of Commons in each particular case.Well, Mr. Chairman, it would not be at all surprising if there were a good many people who, having read those debates last week, came to the conclusion that the battle was already won [hear, hear], and I dare say there are some here tonight who will wonder whether it is really worth while for us to call into being the formidable political machinery of the Free Trade League.
Churchill	0	I confess that I am myself not able to share in this optimism.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	It is quite true that so far as verbal assurances are concerned the Government have pitched Mr. Chamberlain and his policy overboard.
Churchill	0	But I am bound to say I find it difficult to believe in the honesty of His Majesty’s Government.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I think we have got to look at the signs of the weather for ourselves.
Churchill	0	I observe that the Chamberlainite press – that powerful press, that well-organised, well-drilled organisation of newspapers – appears perfectly content with the Government attitude.
Churchill	0	I notice that Mr. Chaplin gives the Government his vote.
Churchill	0	I notice that the tariff reformers walk about the House of Commons trying to look like the accomplished whist players the “Times” says they are, and I don’t forget – I don’t think any of us can forget – the manœvres, not to use a harsher word, by which the Free Trade Ministers were ejected from the Government.
Churchill	0	We cannot forget that Mr. Austen Chamberlain is still at the Exchequer, and that Mr. Walter Long is still at the Local Government Board.Although we are told that the Government is opposed to Protection, to preferential tariffs, to food taxes, to a 10 per cent duty, and to retaliation except with the consent of Parliament – although we are told all this, I notice that this same Government is using the whole force of its organization to procure the return for South Birmingham of Lord Morpeth, who has declared himself in favour of all these things to which the Government say that they are opposed.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Our duty as Free-traders is plain.
Churchill	0	We are not concerned with the shifts and manœuvres of an embarrassed Administration.
Churchill	0	We do not believe that our principles are safe in the hands of the present Administration [hear, hear], and we feel that the time has come when we have got to make our own arrangements for defending those principles.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	The Free Trade League, which is inaugurating its campaign to-night, is the lineal successor of the famous Anti-Corn Law League.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.
Churchill	0	]It is outside party; it is above party.
Churchill	0	We mean to make it worth while for both political parties to be true to Free Trade [cheers], and we mean to make it distinctly not worth while if we can for any candidate who wants to go to the House of Commons, whether Labour or Liberal or Conservative, to go in for Protection.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	In directing the operations of the League it will be found that the Unionist party is divided into three parts.
Churchill	0	First, there are the “whole-hoggers,” so-called, I suppose, because they wish to tax everything except bacon.
Churchill	0	[Loud laughter.]
Churchill	0	Secondly, there are the Unionist Free-traders, who wish to tax nothing except for revenue.
Churchill	0	Both these groups are perfectly easy to understand; you know in a moment whether you agree with them or not.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	And then there is the third part of the party-a much larger part than either of those two I have mentioned, – consisting of gentlemen who say, from various reasons, that they are loyal to the great policy of Sheffield, whatever that may be.
Churchill	0	I think we may call these people the “Sheffield Shufflers” [loud laughter] be cause it is quite clear that they are ready to support any policy, and to fight and shout for any formula, however meaningless, however dishonest, which they think will put off a general election.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	You ought to make it impossible if you can for any candidate within your sphere of influence to be returned to the next House of Commons who is not perfectly clear in his determination to do his best to resist Protection and Protectionist tendencies.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I think you ought to do your best to succour and give cordial support to all those who in their different ways have made exertions and sacrifices for the cause of Free Trade.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	It is a very remarkable thing that no less than 27 Unionist members, in spite of the confusion into which our politics have been thrown and the uncertainty of the issue, have taken their political existence and fortunes in both hands and given a straight vote on Monday last.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	The Liberal party will, I think, make an error in statecraft and in foresight if it compels those gentlemen definitely to change their political character and individuality.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	I think that the Liberal party should whole heartedly support those who-I am not speaking for myself [laughter], I dare say I shall be all right [renewed laughter and cheers] have made great sacrifices for a principle vital to Liberalism [cheers], just as the Conservative party were ready to take the LiberalUnionists in 1886, and if that course be followed, other difficulties and differences will in the course of time, by the irresistible pressure of circumstances, be smoothed away, and the cause of Free Trade be greatly strengthened.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]This controversy comes home with particular force to a Lancashire representative.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	We have only to travel about in a train through the County Palatine and look out at the window to be impressed with the artificial position which it occupies.
Churchill	0	You see all these crowded cities and townships containing many hundreds and thousands of people, a great multitude crowded together upon a soil not sufficiently fertile to maintain one-tenth of their number.
Churchill	0	We know that these people are absolutely dependent for the food they eat and the raw material of their industry upon over-sea trade [cheers] the like of which the world has never seen in this or any other country, in this or any other age, and I confess I feel the gravest anxiety when I see the reckless hands of politicians struggling for political mastery, laid upon all that delicate and stupendous structure, of such vast consequences to as many thousands of very poor people.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Now how will these new proposals affect some of the special interests of Lancashire?
Churchill	0	Let us take the first one that occurs – shipping.
Churchill	0	Shipping is the legitimate child of insular position and unrestricted trade.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	If I may express it in the terms of the sportingNewspaper – “Rule, Britannia, by Free Imports out of Island, is the pedigree.” [Laughter.]
Churchill	0	The history of British shipping, under the combined influence of free imports here and hostile tariffs abroad, is one of the most marvelous and impressive stories in the commercial history of the world.
Churchill	0	In thirty years, as the Duke of Devonshire at Liverpool [cheers], well, I am quite prepared to wait while you cheer the name of the Duke of Devonshire [cheers], in thirty years our shipping has doubled, and we now own half the whole shipping in the world.
Churchill	0	We carry more than one-half of the imports into every country in the world, and we build annually as many ships as all the rest of the world put together.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I submit to you respectfully that the localisation of the shipping trade and the shipbuilding trade in these islands is a factor to be considered not only in our monetary wealth and our commercial prosperity, but is also a factor in our Imperial security.
Churchill	0	[Editor’s Note: Churchill showed how the multiplication of duties would injure the British shipping industry.]
Churchill	0	After all, why do so many ships come to our ports?
Churchill	0	Why are we doing entrepot trade worth nearly sixty millions a year?
Churchill	0	Why should sixty million pounds worth of goods be brought to this country, unloaded by British labour, warehoused, loaded up again, and sent away in British ships to their final destination?
Churchill	0	Why should this process take place here?
Churchill	0	Other harbours are as wide and deep as ours, other climes are just as genial [loud laughter], other skies are just as bright and just as blue [laughter], and why should the world’s shipping labour in the chops of the Channel and toil up the dreary reaches of the Mersey?
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	I think it might happen to be because our harbours are freer than the harbours of any other nation [loud cheers], because the perverted ingenuity of man has not been occupied in obstructing the fair-ways of fiscal stake-nets and tariff mudbars.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	That is our one great advantage, and when we have thrown it away what is it that Mr. Chamberlain has got to offer us in its place?Another important source of Lancashire wealth is the manufacture of machinery and the high-grade manufacture of iron and steel of all kinds.
Churchill	0	You will see for yourselves without any elaboration how necessary a supply of cheap steel is to all those who are engaged in the manufacture of machinery.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	But Mr. Chamberlain proposes to shut out the cheap steel that comes in from abroad, and mind you, the cheap steel that comes in from abroad not only comes in itself cheap but it reduces the price of the steel at home, and if you shut out the supplies of cheap steel from abroad you cannot fail to hinder our trade in machinery.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	And observe that in the iron and steel trade much the most profitable part is the trade in machinery, because it is in the complicated manufactures of iron and steel that labour is most generously rewarded and most varied, and it is in the higher-grade industries that it is most important for an old country like ours to obtain and maintain commercial leadership.
Churchill	0	[[Hear, hear.
Churchill	0	]I come to cotton, and I come to cotton with much trepidation, because I know there are sitting on this platform the greatest authorities in the world.
Churchill	0	I hope they will understand that when I talk about cotton I am not offering them information; I am not presuming to lay down the law to them.
Churchill	0	I am only doing my best to state the Lancashirecase against Protection.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	At the beginning of this controversy the representatives of the cotton trade-masters and men alike declared against the new proposals.
Churchill	0	The representative authority of that meeting has been challenged – I think myself unsuccessfully challenged – [hear, hear], but although its authority has been challenged the wisdom of their declaration has never been impugned.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I take it we all agree that the prosperity of the cotton trade depends upon four main and vital conditions – first, upon an abundant and unfluctuating supply of the raw material [hear, hear]; – second, on the cheapness of production [hear, hear]; – third, on the maintenance of our great Free Trade markets in India and in China; and fourth, on the continuance of industrial peace.
Churchill	0	[“Hear, hear,” and cheers.]
Churchill	0	As to the first, the supply of raw material might be checked by an import duty, or by an export duty, if the United States were to amend their Constitution – and they have amended it several times-by an export duty on the other side.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	But no tariff duty, retaliatory, protective, reciprocal, whatever you like, which can be invented will increase the area of ground under cotton, will ensure good harvests, will reduce freights, will protect the cotton crops from the ravages of devastating germs or of Yankee speculators [laughter] and other pestilential vermin.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.]
Churchill	0	All the other conditions on which the cotton trade depends are adversely affected by the new proposals.Take the case of cheapness of production.
Churchill	0	That, it is agreed, is vital to our trade, because in the first place the Lancashire trade is exposed to severe and nicely calculated competition in the foreign and neutral markets which it serves.
Churchill	0	It is vital, in the second place, because our customers in India and China are very poor people, and if the cotton costs more they will buy less.
Churchill	0	Now, I submit this point to the operatives who are here tonight, that the only basis of cheap production, the only foundation on which it can healthily stand, is the foundation of cheap living and cheap food.
Churchill	0	Supposing that by putting taxes on food, on clothing, on houses; supposing that by some process of that kind you increase the cost of living, supposing you make a sovereign purchase less than it purchases now, supposing you can only buy for a pound what you can now buy for fifteen shillings, one or two things must follow.
Churchill	0	Either the operatives live worse or they get a rise of wages.Now, when wages grow as part of a natural increase and expansion of prosperity, then a rise is a benefit to all.
Churchill	0	But if wages are suddenly jumped up without any corresponding increase in wealth, a shock might easily be administered to this great industry which might result in disaster.
Churchill	0	I have consulted with some of those best qualified to give an opinion on this matter, and I am bound to tell you that I see no prospect of any increase in wages coming to the cotton operatives as a result of Mr. Chamberlain’s proposals.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	When Mr. Chamberlain’s taxes are in force-if ever they are in force?
Churchill	0	[Many voices: Never!]
Churchill	0	Well that depends on you.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	There must immediately begin an agitation for the rise in wages which has been promised contingent on the increased cost of living.
Churchill	0	In the majority of cases this agitation would be resisted by the employer, and although I know that Lancashiremen, whether they are masters or whether they are operatives or trade-union leaders, are distinguished in this country for good sense and moderation and fair dealing [hear, hear]; nevertheless we cannot look forward without the gravest anxiety to a prolonged period of industrial agitation and conflict which must inevitably attend every process of trying to make the increase of wages correspond to the increased cost of living.
Churchill	0	And let me remind any trade unionist who happens to be here of one rather important point.
Churchill	0	At the very time when the working classes are invited to assume new burdens of a serious character upon the understanding that their wages will be raised, at that very moment the trade unionists, owing to recent judicial decisions, are in many ways under disabilities in regard to those steps which they would naturally wish to take to secure the rise in wages that is promised.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Well, there is another way in which the cost of production will be raised.
Churchill	0	Once you have shut out the foreign stuff, the producers at home will very naturally put their heads together.
Churchill	0	They will say, “We have got rid of the German and the Frenchman and the American.
Churchill	0	Don’t let us be such fools as to cut each other’s throats,” and they will make the great combination which inevitably follows in the wake of a high protective tariff.
Churchill	0	Now we see perfectly well how the Protectionist manufacturer thinks he is going to gain.
Churchill	0	He sees it very well too.
Churchill	0	People are shocked when I suggest that these great producers have joined the Tariff Commission because it is their interest to do so.
Churchill	0	They tell me that the landlords are in favour of Mr. Chamberlain’s proposals because they wish to consolidate the Empire at two shillings a quarter [great laughter and cheers], and they say that the Protectionist manufacturers are in favour of Mr. Chamberlain’s proposals because they love the working man.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	They love the working man, and they love to see him work.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.]
Churchill	0	We are often told that Free-traders talk too much about the consumer and always forget about the producer.
Churchill	0	Well, it is quite true that the greatest manufacturer is a great producer; but he is also a great consumer.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	The greater the scale of his business, the greater the scale of his consumption.
Churchill	0	The bigger the mill he has, the more it costs to run, and I should like anyone who is familiar with the working of some great mill to try and turn over in his mind how much the cost of production in that mill would be increased if everything in the mill – the building, the machinery, the oil, and the can in which the oil is kept [laughter], the lamps by which the building is lighted, the paper on which the accounts are kept, and the spectacles which the senior partner wears [laughter], – if everything big or little from one end of the land to the other that you can think of was increased by 10 per cent, or more than 10 per cent, how much would the cost of production in a mill be increased?
Churchill	0	I think if all this increased cost of production is to be compensated by the increased profits of the proprietors of the mill, they will have to charge the public a pretty figure merely to get back the extra cost of production, not considering at all any extra profits, as the result of the new duties.The cotton trade, as everybody knows inside Lancashire – and I hope some of the tariff reformers will find it out soon – [laughter], is mainly an export trade.
Churchill	0	If you raise the cost of production India and China will not be able to buy so much.
Churchill	0	Their demand will fall off, and not only will their demand fall off but other inferior kinds of cotton goods will come in to take the place of the more expensive goods we make.
Churchill	0	And in consequence of this the cotton spinner will have to pay the higher prices which are the result of the protective duties, but will not be able to exact those higher profits which are the compensation for them.So I say that the manufacturer will lose in three ways, and he will lose in an unmeasured degree.
Churchill	0	He will lose as a great consumer through having to pay more for all he uses; he will lose as a competitor in neutral markets by not being able to compete so well with his rivals; and he will lose because people at home and abroad will not have so much money to spend on the things he makes.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	I think there is a fourth way in which he may lose.
Churchill	0	Here and there no doubt individuals will make great fortunes, and we shall grow a Rockefeller or a Pierpont Morgan on our own.
Churchill	0	But the small producer is very likely to lose and to be absorbed, as many have been in America and Germany, in some great and greedy combine, and instead of being an independent producer standing on his own legs he will find himself a salaried servant of some great syndicate.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.
Churchill	0	]If the small manufacturer is likely to be disturbed how about the working man?
Churchill	0	At the present when a man has a quarrel with his employer he may go elsewhere.
Churchill	0	But once your great universal combination is made, like the great steel trust in the United States – when that combination was made any man who quarreled with Charley Schwabe, or whoever was the ruffian in charge [loud laughter], – found every steel-works in the country shut against him.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	I have often heard it said that the old economists did not foresee modern conditions.
Churchill	0	Quite true; they did not know how strong their case was, and I say that this danger of great combinations is alone sufficient to make the case for Free Trade today stronger than it ever was.How are we going to find out the point beyond which combination becomes unhealthy?
Churchill	0	I do not attempt to speak with certainty.
Churchill	0	I will only tell you my belief.
Churchill	0	My belief is that no combination or hardly any combination which can grow up in a Free Trade country under natural conditions can be seriously injurious to the public welfare.
Churchill	0	But the combinations which grow up in great protected countries, where they have bribed the Legislature, obtain the right to fleece the public, to charge their own people what they like.
Churchill	0	The monopolies and combinations which grow up on an illicit tariff advantage – these are the combinations which are injurious [Cheers.]
Churchill	0	We have experienced in Lancashire in the last two years the dangers and the vexations of a limited and a localised supply of cotton.
Churchill	0	We have to get nearly all our cotton from the United States, and when there is a shortage, a bad crop there, all kinds of gamblers and speculators are able to come in and deprive thousands of hard-working people of the legitimate fruits of their industry.
Churchill	0	[Editor’s Note: Turning to the remedy for this, Churchill continued]: We must vary and multiply the source of cotton supply.
Churchill	0	When we talk about Empire cotton we are not talking mere sentiment, but common sense as well.
Churchill	0	A well-considered and thrifty policy of railway development in West Africa and the Soudan would do far more to help Lancashire trade than Mr. Chamberlain’s food taxes or Mr. Balfour’s tariff wars.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]It is the theory of the Protectionist that imports are an evil.
Churchill	0	He thinks that if you shut out the foreign imported manufactured goods you will make these goods yourselves, in addition to the goods which you make now, including those goods which we make to exchange for the foreign goods that come in.
Churchill	0	If a man can believe that he can believe anything.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	We Free-traders say it is not true.
Churchill	0	To think you can make a man richer by putting on a tax is like a man thinking that he can stand in a bucket and lift himself up by the handle.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.
Churchill	0	]But supposing it were true; what a curious position we should be in.
Churchill	0	What a mistake it would have been to have built the Manchester Ship Canal.
Churchill	0	Here is this great work, built what for?
Churchill	0	To facilitate dumping [cheers], to pour a stream of foreign imports into the heart of industrial Britain.
Churchill	0	But that is not the only curious reflection that would occur to one if the Protectionists were right in their theory.
Churchill	0	If it be true that imports are an evil, and that by shutting them out you could acquire great wealth, then I say that is just as true for Ireland as it is for England, for India as it is for Australia.
Churchill	0	Now, Mr. Chamberlain said at Greenock – I have abbreviated the passage a little, but I have not altered the sense – that since 1882 the imports of foreign manufactures had increased on the balance by 52 millions, and he calculated that if these had been shut out, and made at home instead, we should have gained 26 million in wages alone, provided constant employment at 30s a week for 330,000 people with their families that is, for more than one and a half million persons altogether.
Churchill	0	It seems easy, doesn’t it?
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	And Mr. Bonar Law [laughter], the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade in this Free Trade Administration [laughter], went even further, and, as often happens to people who go further, he fared worse.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	He said, speaking at the Constitutional Club, that there was an import of 150 millions of manufactured goods, representing a loss in wages of 70 or 80 millions, and he thought “that a large part of that sum could, by a stroke of the pen, be secured to the British workman without any loss at all corresponding to the advantages that the country would gain by the change.”All this is very interesting.
Churchill	0	Suppose these gentlemen-and they are very distinguished persons, and the whole of this great agitation depends on what they say [laughter], suppose they are right (I admit it is a great effort of imagination), suppose that by a stroke of the pen all this vast wealth can really be secured for Britain, then I say the plan holds good everywhere else too.
Churchill	0	I say it is just as true for Indiaas for Canada, if it be true that foreign goods displace British labour, it is not less true that British goods displace Indian labour.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	If it be economically wise for Englandto shut out foreign imported manufactures, it must be economically wise for India to shut out British imported manufactures.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]The condition of India is of vast importance in Lancashire.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	It is important to us that her markets should be free, and that her people should be prosperous and contented.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	But that is not all.
Churchill	0	India, as your chairman has reminded you, is a great trust.
Churchill	0	We owe a duty to the land and the people of Hindustan.
Churchill	0	[Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	The lives, the liberties, the progress towards civilization – towards a better and a happier state of life of 300,000,000 of human souls, is confided to our care; and the priceless possession of India, with its traditions of immemorial antiquity and its unmeasured possibilities for the future – the possession of India raises the authority of these small islands, more than all our colonies and dependencies, above the level of the greatest empires of the present or the past.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]But on what does our rule in India depend?
Churchill	0	Does it depend on force or terror, or simply on the superior knowledge of the governors whom we place in charge?
Churchill	0	No, our rule in Indiadoes not depend on thirty thousand civilians and seventy thousand soldiers.
Churchill	0	It could not endure a day – certainly not a month – unless it were founded on the belief which the people of India have acquired that our motives are lofty and disinterested.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	British justice is the foundation of the British domination in India.
Churchill	0	Destroy that and the whole stately edifice of our power and dominion, which has been built up by the labour and toil of so many generations, will come clattering to the ground.
Churchill	0	We have prevented India from imposing tariffs against us.
Churchill	0	When, a few years ago, Indiadesired to put a revenue duty upon cotton, Lancashire insisted that there should be a countervailing Excise.
Churchill	0	Every Lancashire member was pledged to work and speak for it.
Churchill	0	Every constituency, or almost every constituency, passed resolutions in favour of that.
Churchill	0	We were told it was the keystone of our Free Trade policy, that if no Excise duty had been put on the English producer would have reaped a protective advantage.
Churchill	0	And we showed that we were sincere, because we practised at home what we preached abroad.
Churchill	0	Where will British justice be if in the days when Mr. Bonar Law’s theory is proved right, when it is proved that by a stroke of the pen India could get wealth, when it is proved that by shutting out twenty millions of imported Lancashire manufactured goods India could save ten millions a year in wages – which would keep goodness knows how many Indian families [laughter], what are we to say in those days, and where will British justice be, if while we protect ourselves and admit that Protection is right for ourselves, we refuse to allow India to employ the advantages of this new theory?Ever since I have had anything to do with Lancashire it has been impressed upon me by my constituents, by my friends in Oldham [laughter], by my friends on the Conservative committees in Oldham, that it was my duty to work for two things – the removal of duties upon our imports of cotton into India and the preservation of “the open door” in China.
Churchill	0	I was able to work for that because I was a Free-trader and believed it was good for all parties – for the Indian as well as for us, for the Chinese as well as for us.
Churchill	0	[(Hear, hear.]
Churchill	0	Very well, but now it turns out that a great many of those gentlemen who were urging me to do this were lifelong Protectionists, and they agree with Mr. Bonar Law, and all the time that they were urging their representative to vote for making India Free Trade they knew Free Trade was a very bad thing for India, depriving India of goodness knows how much in wages and employment for I don’t know how many starving hundreds, and all the time they were fighting for the open door in China secretly in their hearts they were longing for the shut door here.
Churchill	0	Can anybody wonder that Lord George Hamilton [cheers], who has been responsible for imposing these Free-trade principles upon India, refused to become a party to such cynical humbug as that [cheers], and withdrew with dignity and honour to a private station.Here we are, in the dawn of the twentieth century, in spite of the drain of a costly war, in spite of our easy-going methods, in spite of the profuse and profligate expenditure, in spite of the luxury of our wealthy classes [hear, hear], here we are in the dawn of the twentieth century not inferior in wealth, power, contentment, and in fame to any nation on the face of the globe.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	But what is the conclusion to which these reflections lead us?
Churchill	0	Surely it is full of encouragement and inspiration.
Churchill	0	Large views always triumph over small ideas.
Churchill	0	Broad economic principles always in the end defeat the sharp devices of expediency; science is better than sleight of hand; justice outwits intrigues; free imports can contend with hostile tariffs; honesty is, in fact, the policy that pays the best.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	It is the fashion nowadays to sneer at the Manchester school; and no abuse, however ribald, is considered bad enough for Mr. Cobden.
Churchill	0	But I dare say there are some people tonight who will think that it is about time that the philanthropic, peaceful, progressive, socialising doctrines which were prescribed by Mr. Cobden and Mr.
Churchill	0	Bright [cheers] were a little more considered by the statesmen who govern our land.
Churchill	0	[“Hear, hear” and cheers.]
Churchill	0	No one will pretend that these doctrines were a complete revelation of human policy; but it was Mr. Cobden’s work to lay a great and valuable stone in the long stairway of human achievement.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	We may differ widely – we probably do – in this great hall tonight as to how far, how fast, or in what direction our next advance is to be made, but on one point we are all united – we are not going back one inch.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]I move “That this meeting affirms its unshaken belief in the principles of Free Trade adopted more than fifty years ago, and expresses its conviction that Free Trade is now more than ever necessary for the well-being of the United Kingdom.”
Churchill	0	Churchill reiterated his Liverpool speech in Oxford on 25 April, and in letters to The Times on 30 April and 2 May.
Churchill	0	On 13 May, in a crowded House of Commons, he delivered an assault on Brodrick which, as he later wrote, “marked a definitive divergence of thought and sympathy from all those who thronged the benches around me.” The speech had been meticulously prepared and learned by heart, as Churchill had sent the text in advance to The Morning Post.
Churchill	0	It was a dangerous move, as there was no guarantee that he would be called by the Speaker.—Sir Robert Rhodes JamesI find myself differing on this occasion from the right Hon.
Churchill	0	Baronet the Member for the Forest of Dean [Sir Charles Dilke], and although we are on different sides of the House, I regret that I do not differ from him in the right way at all.
Churchill	0	He is very anxious to increase the cost of the Army.
Churchill	0	[Sir Charles Dilke: No.
Churchill	0	]I have put the words down.
Churchill	0	I understand he is anxious to increase the cost of the Army in some respects, and he has delivered a speech which is of very great weight, coming as it does from one who is justly entitled to be considered a military expert.
Churchill	0	I think that the right hon.
Churchill	0	Baronet is also a remarkable instance of a very peculiar phenomenon.
Churchill	0	I have always noticed that whenever a Radical takes to Imperialism he catches it in a very acute form.
Churchill	0	That, perhaps, explains the vigorous manner in which the right hon.
Churchill	0	Baronet has defended further military expenditure at this juncture.I have no doubt the House has been powerfully impressed by the speech delivered on this side by my right hon.
Churchill	0	friend the Chief Secretary for Ireland.
Churchill	0	I think we may congratulate ourselves on the return of the Chief Secretary to the theatre of war, in which he had previously earned such a distinguished reputation.
Churchill	0	We have heard from him a very illuminating and comprehensive speech on the Army question, and I for one have always regarded it as rather unfair that my right hon.
Churchill	0	friend, who more than any other Minister was responsible for encouraging the nation to embark on this course of military expenditure, should escape into the secluded tranquility of the Irish Office and leave to the Secretary for War the duty of facing the storm that this expenditure has excited and is arousing.But I cannot follow my right hon.
Churchill	0	friend on this occasion as I have followed him in the past, and as I hope to follow him in the future.
Churchill	0	I wish to complain very respectfully, but most urgently, that the Army Estimates involved by the scheme lately explained by the Secretary of State for War are much too high, and ought to be reduced, if not this year, certainly at the conclusion of the South African campaign.I regard it as a grave mistake in Imperial policy to spend thirty millions a year on the Army.
Churchill	0	I hold that the continued increase in Army expenditure cannot be viewed by supporters of the Government without the greatest alarm and apprehension, and by Members who represent working class constituencies without extreme dislike.
Churchill	0	I desire to urge considerations of economy on His Majesty’s Government, and as a practical step that the number of soldiers which they propose to keep ready for expeditionary purposes should be substantially reduced.First of all I exclude altogether from this discussion the cost of the South African War.
Churchill	0	Once you are so unfortunate as to be drawn into a war, no price is too great to pay for an early and victorious peace.
Churchill	0	All economy of soldiers or supplies is the worst extravagance in war.
Churchill	0	I am concerned only with the Estimates for the ordinary service of the year, which are increasing at such a rate that it is impossible to view them without alarm.
Churchill	0	Does the House realise what British expenditure on armaments amounts to?
Churchill	0	See how our Army Estimates have grown—seventeen millions in 1894, eighteen in 1897, nineteen in 1899,twenty-four in 1900, and finally in the present year no less than twenty-nine millions eight hundred thousand.
Churchill	0	Indeed we are moving rapidly, but in what direction?
Churchill	0	Sir, I see in this accelerating increase the momentum of a falling body and a downward course.
Churchill	0	I do not wish to reproach the Secretary of State for War for the enormous sEstimates now presented.
Churchill	0	He is not to blame.
Churchill	0	The Secretary of State for War does not usually direct, or even powerfully influence, the policy of a Government.
Churchill	0	He is concerned with his own Department, and it is his business to get all he can for that Department.
Churchill	0	I must say the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman appears to have done his work remarkably well.
Churchill	0	Indeed, if the capacity of a War Minister may be measured in anyway by the amount of money he can obtain from his colleagues for military purposes, the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman will most certainly go down to history as the greatest War Minister this country has ever had.
Churchill	0	I think this House ought to take a wider view of our Imperial responsibilities than is perhaps possible from the windows of the War Office.If I might be allowed to revive a half-forgotten episode—it is half-forgotten because it has passed into that period of twilight which intervenes between the bright glare of newspaper controversy and the calm rays of the lamp of history—I would recall that once on a time a Conservative and Unionist Administration came into power supported by a large majority, nearly as powerful, and much more cohesive, than that which now supports His Majesty’s Government, and when the time came round to consider the Estimates the usual struggle took place between the great spending Departments and the Treasury.
Churchill	0	I say “usual”; at least it used to be so.
Churchill	0	I do not know whether it is so now.The Government of the day threw their weight on the side of the great spending Departments, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer [Lord Randolph Churchill, WSC’s father] resigned.
Churchill	0	The controversy was bitter, the struggle uncertain, but in the end the Government triumphed, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer went down for ever, and with him, as it now seems, there fell also the cause of retrenchment and economy, so that the very memory thereof seems to have perished, and the words themselves have a curiously old-fashioned ring about them.I suppose that was a lesson which Chancellors of the Exchequer were not likely to forget in a hurry.
Churchill	0	I should like, if I might be permitted, to read the passage, which appears extremely relevant to the question now before the House.
Churchill	0	Writing from the Carlton Club on the 22nd of December, 1886, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in resigning his office, wrote to Lord Salisbury, who had pointed out the desperate state of Europeand the possibilities of immediate war, very much in the same way as he has done recently.
Churchill	0	The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied as follows:“The great question of public expenditure is not so technical or departmental as might be supposed by a superficial critic.
Churchill	0	Foreign policy and free expenditure upon armaments act and react upon one another.”That has been said before in this debate, and it is what the Chief Secretary for Ireland called a hackneyed tag.
Churchill	0	I think, with as much reason, you might also call the Ten Commandments a hackneyed tag.“A wise foreign policy [Lord Randolph Churchill continued] will extricate Englandfrom Continental struggles and keep her outside of German, Russian, French, or Austrian disputes.
Churchill	0	I have for some time observed a tendency in the Government attitude to pursue a different line of action, which I have not been able to modify or check.
Churchill	0	This tendency is certain to be accentuated if large Estimates are presented to and voted by Parliament.
Churchill	0	The possession of a very sharp sword offers a temptation which becomes irresistible to demonstrate the efficiency of the weapon in a practical manner.
Churchill	0	I remember the vulnerable and scattered character of the Empire, the universality of our commerce, the peaceful tendencies of our democratic electorate, the hard times, the pressure of competition, and the high taxation now imposed: and with these facts vividly before me I decline to be a party to encouraging the military and militant circle of the War Office and Admiralty to join in the high and desperate stakes which other nations seem to be forced to risk.”Wise words, Sir, stand the test of time, and I am very glad the House has allowed me, after an interval of fifteen years, to lift again the tattered flag I found lying on a stricken field.
Churchill	0	[Other versions of this speech read “…tattered flag of retrenchment and economy.” Our version is from the official biography.
Churchill	0	]But what was the amount of the annual Estimates on which this desperate battle was fought?
Churchill	0	It may be difficult for the House to realise it, though it is within the memory of so many hon.
Churchill	0	Members.
Churchill	0	“The Estimates for the year,” said the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in resigning, “for the two services amount to no less than £31,000,000, and I cannot consent to that.” What are the Estimates we are asked to vote now?
Churchill	0	We are now asked to vote, quite irrespective of the drain of a costly war still in progress, something more than fifty-nine millions for the ordinary service of the year.This incident which I have been bringing to the mind of the House did not happen a century ago.
Churchill	0	It is quite recent history.
Churchill	0	The Leader of the House was already a famous Minister, the present Chancellor had already been Leader of the House, Lord Salisbury was already Prime Minister, when thirty-one millions was considered by theTreasury a demand which ought to be resisted tooth and nail.
Churchill	0	What has happened in the meanwhile to explain this astonishing increase?
Churchill	0	Has the wealth of the country doubled?
Churchill	0	Has the population of the Empire doubled?
Churchill	0	Have the armies of Europedoubled?
Churchill	0	Is the commercial competition of foreign nations so much reduced?
Churchill	0	Are we become the undisputed master in the markets of the world?
Churchill	0	Is there no poverty at home?
Churchill	0	Has the English Channeldried up, and are we no longer an island?
Churchill	0	Is the revenue so easily raised that we do not know how to spend it?
Churchill	0	Are the Treasury buildings pulled down, and all our financiers fled?
Churchill	0	What has happened to explain this extraordinary change?
Churchill	0	During the few weeks I have been a Member of this House I have heard hon.
Churchill	0	Members advocate many causes, but no voice is raised in the cause of economy.
Churchill	0	The Financial Secretary to the War Office, who above all should keep some eye on the purse strings, speaking the other night at some dinner, boasted that he was not animated by any niggardly spirit of economy.
Churchill	0	Not one voice is raised for reduced expenditure and lightening the public burden, if I may except, in order to be quite correct, the protests raised and the cries for economy from the Irish benches—economy of money, not economy of time—and even through the Irish protests for economy, I am sorry to say, there ran the melancholy dirge, “and how much is Irelandgoing to get out of it?”How can this tendency to extravagant expenditure be checked?
Churchill	0	The Opposition can do nothing.
Churchill	0	Of course, we shall outvote them.
Churchill	0	The House has no control whatever over Supply.
Churchill	0	The Treasury can do nothing against the great spending Departments, and in view of the fate that befell the last Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was obdurate, can we wonder that the present distinguished occupant of that office has been compelled to bow before the storm?
Churchill	0	The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave an extraordinary reason for not objecting to, but supporting, this military expenditure.
Churchill	0	He said it had been demanded, that it was popular.
Churchill	0	Expenditure always is popular; the only unpopular part about it is the raising of the money to pay the expenditure.
Churchill	0	But if that is an extraordinary reason, it is nothing to that put forward by my right hon.
Churchill	0	friend to-night, who asked pathetically, “What are we to do with our generals?” When they come home from South Africa with no more worlds to conquer they must keep their hands in, and they must be provided with an army, even if it does cost thirty millions a year, to enable them to keep their hands in, and to save them from getting out of practice.
Churchill	0	I am, I know, a very young man, but I confess I never heard anything like that before.
Churchill	0	I had always been led to believe that the generals existed for the Army, and not the Army for the generals.The phrase “happy-go-lucky self indulgence,” which was used by my hon.
Churchill	0	friend, seems to me to come in very appropriately somewhere about here.
Churchill	0	My right hon.
Churchill	0	friend is content to arm me with a blunderbuss.
Churchill	0	Well, a blunderbuss is a traditional weapon with which the British householder defends himself from those who seek to plunder him.
Churchill	0	Though it is a very antiquated and obsolete weapon, yet at close quarters, at about the range at which my right hon.
Churchill	0	friend is sitting now, it has been found very effective.I stand here to plead the cause of economy.
Churchill	0	I think it is about time that a voice was heard from this side of the House pleading that unpopular cause; that someone not on the bench opposite, but a Conservative by tradition, whose fortunes are linked indissolubly to the Tory party, who knows something of the majesty and power of Britain beyond the seas, upon whom rests no taint of cosmopolitanism, should stand forward and say what he can to protest against the policy of daily increasing the public burden.
Churchill	0	If such a one is to stand forward in such a cause, then, I say it humbly, but with I hope becoming pride, no one has a better right than I have, for this is a cause I have inherited, and a cause for which the late Lord Randolph Churchill made the greatest sacrifice of any Minister of modern times.Now, bearing all that in mind, I come to the scheme of the Secretary of State.
Churchill	0	I do not propose to consider that scheme in detail, that would be an interminable labour.
Churchill	0	When the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman introduced the scheme—in a speech of surpassing clearness—it looked genuine, but in the weeks that have passed since he disclosed it to the House it has been sadly knocked about, crushed in the press, and exploded in the magazines, and has excited nothing but doubt in the country.
Churchill	0	The number of Amendments on the Paper shows the feeling of the House, and I know what some of the soldiers say about it.
Churchill	0	I do not feel equal to repeating their expressions here-but I shall be delighted to inform any hon.
Churchill	0	Member desiring information privately.
Churchill	0	It is no good mincing matters.This is not the best scheme that could be devised.
Churchill	0	I do not say that it does not contain any wise and ingenious provisions, nor that it will not give strength to the Army.
Churchill	0	Material strength is expected even in this country to follow great expenditure of money.
Churchill	0	But if the truth must be told, although this scheme involves an expenditure of nearly £30,000,000 a year, with further increases in prospect, it nevertheless leaves most of  the great questions connected with Army reform almost entirely untouched.
Churchill	0	But what could be expected?
Churchill	0	The ordinary duties of a Minister are, I have always understood, sufficiently arduous.The War Office is a particularly hard job even in peace time.
Churchill	0	But we are at war.
Churchill	0	Not only has the Secretary of State to defend in this House every act of military policy big or little, but he has also to see—I hope it will not escape his attention—that an Army of more than two hundred thousand men actively engaged with the enemy lacks nothing that wealth or science can produce.
Churchill	0	Now that ought to be enough for the energy even of the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman.
Churchill	0	Why, Sir, the labours of Hercules are nothing  to it.But all this is not enough for the insatiable industry of the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman.
Churchill	0	He must, forsooth, rearrange the internal mechanism of the War Office.
Churchill	0	He must take his engines to pieces while the ship is beating up under full steam against the gale.
Churchill	0	That is not all.
Churchill	0	No; in the few moments of leisure that fall to a public man in this country he must thoroughly reorganise and reform the whole system of the Army.
Churchill	0	Who can wonder that he has increased the quantity of his output only to the detriment of the quality, as happens to literary men?
Churchill	0	I had put down an Amendment, which it will not be in order now to move, which to my mind possesses advantages over that we are now discussing.
Churchill	0	In the first place, it removed the question from the party sphere in which it now lies, and in which it must now be decided.
Churchill	0	In the second place, it provided the Government with a means of retreat from the very uncomfortable position in which they have managed to get themselves.
Churchill	0	I do not expect hon.
Churchill	0	members on this side will agree with me, and I recognise that I am putting considerable strain upon their forbearance by the view I take of this matter, but I ask them for their indulgence while I state my view.
Churchill	0	My view is that we should have gone on with ordinary reforms which do not involve a large increase of expenditure, either of money or men, the better selection and promotion of officers, a question which the Secretary of State  has shown himself willing to carry out with unflinching courage, the provision of better arms and the gradual adoption of new military material and weapons.
Churchill	0	What is called in The Times this morning the “grandiose”—that is the word for which I have been looking—the grandiose portion of the scheme should be postponed until such time as the South African war has assumed its true proportions in our eyes, and the men now in South Africa best qualified to do so have come home to give their attention to the reorganisation of the Army, and until those managing the War Office are relieved from the high pressure at which they are now working.That is a tale that has not been unfolded, and this question is now before the House on party lines.
Churchill	0	I confess I am unable to support the resolution of the Government; but the Amendment of the Leader of the Opposition does not attract me any more.
Churchill	0	His differences are differences of detail, not of principle.
Churchill	0	My objections are objections of principle.
Churchill	0	I hold it is unwise to have no regard to the fact that in this reform we are diverting national resources from their proper channels of development.
Churchill	0	It may be argued that if other nations increase their armed force so must we.
Churchill	0	If you look into the tangled mass of figures on this subject you will find that while other nations during the last fifteen years have been increasing their navies we have been increasing our expenditure on our Army, which is not after all our most important weapon.I am pleading the cause of economy first of all.
Churchill	0	But I have got two strings to my bow, or perhaps I should say two barrels to  my blunderbuss.
Churchill	0	Failing economy, let us have wise expenditure.
Churchill	0	My contention is that we are spending too much money on armaments, and so may impair our industries; but that if the money has to be spent, then it would be better to spend it on the Fleet than on the Army.Of course we must have an Army, not only as a training school for our garrisons abroad, but because it would be unhealthy, and even immoral, for the people of Great Britain to live sleek, timid, and secure, protected by a circle of ironclad ships.
Churchill	0	It would have been a pleasant task to examine some of the wise and ingenious provisions which the scheme of the Secretary of State for War contains.But I have assumed a more melancholy duty to-night, one, perhaps, which would be more fittingly discharged by some hon.
Churchill	0	Member on the other side of the House.
Churchill	0	I contend that to spend thirty millions a year on the British Army is an unwise policy, against which the House must protest.
Churchill	0	Sir, at the last election I placarded “Army Reform” as large as anyone.
Churchill	0	I am pledged to the hilt to Army reform.But what is Army reform?
Churchill	0	I take it to be one of two things.
Churchill	0	Either it means the same efficiency at a reduced cost, or increased efficiency for the same cost.
Churchill	0	Perhaps it might mean greatly increased efficiency for a slightly increased cost.
Churchill	0	But the one thing it certainly does not mean is a larger number of Regular soldiers.
Churchill	0	That is not Army reform, but Army increase.In the last four years the present Ministers have added no fewer than fifty-seven thousand men to the Regular standing Army.
Churchill	0	A further increase—disguised in various ways—is contemplated in the present scheme.
Churchill	0	Sir, it is against this Army increase that I protest, first in the interests of economy, secondly in the interests of the Fleet.
Churchill	0	I complain of the increase in Regular soldiers, and particularly of the provision of the three army corps which are to be kept ready for expeditionary purposes.
Churchill	0	I contend that they ought to be reduced by two army corps, on the ground that one is quite enough to fight savages, and three are not enough even to begin to fight Europeans.I hope the House will let me elaborate this.
Churchill	0	The enormous and varied frontiers of the Empire, and our many points of contact with barbarous peoples, will surely in the future, as in the past, draw us into frequent little wars.
Churchill	0	Our military system must therefore be adapted for dealing with these minor emergencies smoothly and conveniently.
Churchill	0	But we must not expect to meet the great civilized Powers in this easy fashion.
Churchill	0	We must not regard war with a modern Power as a kind of game in which we may take a hand, and with good luck and good management may play adroitly for an evening and come safe home with our winnings.
Churchill	0	It is not that, and I rejoice that it cannot be that.
Churchill	0	A European war cannot be anything but a cruel, heartrending struggle, which, if we are ever to enjoy the bitter fruits of victory, must demand, perhaps for several years, the whole manhood of the nation, the entire suspension of peaceful industries, and the concentrating to one end of every vital energy in the community.I have frequently been astonished since I have been in this House to hear with what composure and how glibly Members, and even Ministers, talk of a European war.
Churchill	0	I will not expatiate on the horrors of war, but there has been a great change which the House should not omit to notice.
Churchill	0	In former days, when wars arose from individual causes, from the policy of a Minister or the passion of a King, when they were fought by small regular armies of professional soldiers, and when their course was retarded by the difficulties of communication and supply, and often suspended by the winter season, it was possible to limit the liabilities of the combatants.
Churchill	0	But now, when mighty populations are impelled on each other, each individual severally embittered and inflamed—when the resources of science and civilization sweep away everything that might mitigate their fury—a European war can only end in the ruin of the vanquished and the scarcely less fatal commercial dislocation and exhaustion of the conquerors.Democracy is more vindictive than Cabinets.
Churchill	0	The wars of peoples will be more terrible than those of kings.“Why, then,” it may be said,” surely we must neglect nothing to make ourselves secure.
Churchill	0	Let us vote this thirty millions without more ado.” If this vast expenditure on the Army were going to make us absolutely secure?
Churchill	0	Much though I hate unproductive expenditure, I would not complain.
Churchill	0	But it will do no such thing.
Churchill	0	The Secretary for War knows—none better thanhe—that it will not make us secure, and that if we went to war with any great Power his three army corps would scarcely serve as a vanguard.If we are hated, they will not make us loved.
Churchill	0	They are a broken reed to trust to.
Churchill	0	If we are in danger, they will not make us safe.
Churchill	0	They are enough to irritate; they are not enough to overawe.
Churchill	0	They cannot make us invulnerable, but they may very likely make us venturesome.A prudent man insures his house against fire.
Churchill	0	We are often told this military expenditure is an insurance premium.
Churchill	0	Well, there is no doubt about the premium; we are paying that all right.
Churchill	0	But I would respectfully remind the House that the premium has been put up during the last five years, and is in fact so high now that, so far as I can calculate, in order to make our insurance policy a good bargain we should have to have a war equal to the Boer war every fifteen years.
Churchill	0	But do we get the insurance?
Churchill	0	In putting our trust in an army are we not investing in a shaky concern?
Churchill	0	In a firm that could not meet its obligations when called on?It may be said that it is not a mere question of pounds, shillings, and pence, but that it is a question of the honour and security of the Empire.
Churchill	0	I do not agree.
Churchill	0	The honour and security of the British Empiredo not depend, and can never depend, on the British Army.
Churchill	0	The Admiralty is the only Office strong enough to insure the British Empire; and it can only be strong enough to do so because it has hitherto enjoyed the preferential monopoly of the sea.Moreover, the provision of these three army corps, ready to embark and attack anybody anywhere, is undoubtedly most provocative to the other Powers.
Churchill	0	No other nation makes, or has ever made, such a provision.
Churchill	0	And what of its effect on us?
Churchill	0	It is quite true that foreign nations possess gigantic armies and have lived at peace for thirty years.
Churchill	0	Foreign nations know what war is.
Churchill	0	There is scarcely a capital in Europewhich has not been taken in the last one hundred years, and it is the lively realisation of the awful consequences of war which maintains the peace of Europe.We do not know what war is.
Churchill	0	We have had a glimpse of it in South Africa.
Churchill	0	Even in miniature it is hideous and appalling; but, for all our experience, war to us does not mean what it means to the Frenchman, or the German, or the Austrian.
Churchill	0	Are we not arming ourselves with their weapons without being under their restraints?
Churchill	0	What I fear is that these three costly and beautiful army corps, which are to be kept ready—almost at a moment’s notice—for foreign war will develop in the country, if they need developing, feelings of pride and power, which will not only be founded in actual military superiority, but only on the appearance of it.
Churchill	0	And in these days, when popular newspapers, appealing with authority to countless readers, are prepared almost every morning to urge us into war against one or other—and sometimes several—of the Great Powers of the earth, surely we ought not to make it seem so easy, and even attractive, to embark on such terrible enterprises, or to think that with the land forces at our disposal we may safely intermeddle in the European game?What is our weapon, then?
Churchill	0	The only weapon with which we can expect to cope with great nations is the Navy.
Churchill	0	This is what the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant calls “trust to luck and the Navy” policy.
Churchill	0	I confess I do trust the Navy.
Churchill	0	This new distrust of the Navy, a kind of shrinking from our natural element, the blue water on which we have ruled so long, is the most painful symptom of the military hydrophobia with which we are afflicted.
Churchill	0	Without a supreme Navy, whatever military arrangements we may make, whether for foreign expeditions orhome defence, must be utterly vain and futile.
Churchill	0	With such a Navy we may hold any antagonist at arm’s length and feed ourselves in the meantime, until, if we find it necessary, we can turn every city in the country into an arsenal, and the whole male population into an army.
Churchill	0	Sir, the superiority of the Navy is vital to our national existence.
Churchill	0	That has been said before.
Churchill	0	No one will deny that or thank me for repeating the obvious.
Churchill	0	Yet this tremendous Army expenditure directly challenges the principle, and those who advocate it are false to the principle they so loudly proclaim.
Churchill	0	For the main reason that enables us to maintain the finest Navy in the world is that whereas every European Power has to support a vast Army first of all, we in this fortunate, happy island, relieved by our insular position of a double burden, may turn our undivided efforts and attention to the Fleet.Why should we sacrifice a game in which we are sure to win to play a game in which we are bound to lose?
Churchill	0	For the same rule most certainly has a converse application, and just as foreign Powers by reason of their pressing land responsibilities must be inferior to us at sea, so we, whatever our effort, whatever our expenditure, by reason of our paramount sea responsibilities must be inferior to them on land.
Churchill	0	And surely to adopt the double policy of equal effort both on Army and Navy, spending thirty millions on each, is to combine the disadvantages and dangers of all courses without the advantages or security of any, and to run the risk of crashing to the ground between two stools, with a Navy uselessly weak and a Army uselessly strong.We are told we have “commitments”—not a very cheerful expression—in three continents, and that it is in consequence of these “commitments” that we must keep three army corps ready for immediate expeditionary purposes.
Churchill	0	On what principle are there to be three rather than two or eight?
Churchill	0	I had hoped that the formulation of some definite principle governing our military needs would be a prominent feature of any scheme of Army reform submitted to the nation.
Churchill	0	I suppose the principle on which the army corps have been selected is, one continent, one army corps.
Churchill	0	Well, Sir, I should like to look into that.In the first place there is Asia.
Churchill	0	What is our danger there?
Churchill	0	Of course, it is an Anglo-Russian war on the frontier of India.
Churchill	0	But if anyone takes Lord Salisbury’s advice—and sometimes he gives very good advice—to use large scale maps of Central Asia, they will see that any Russian enterprise against India would either have to be made with a small force, in which case our Indian Army would be sufficient to resist it, or else railways would have to be built, just as Lord Kitchener had to build a railway to Khartoum, to feed the great invading forces in the barren lands through which they must march, in which case we should have plenty of time to levy and train as many British troops as we might think fit.Then we have a”commitment” in North America—a “commitment” which is growing more able to take care of itself every day—not a “commitment” about which we need feel much anxiety.
Churchill	0	Sir, we must not, however, shrink from the responsibility.
Churchill	0	Of course, the danger which might assail us in this quarter of the globe would only be a war with the great friendly commercial nation to the southward.
Churchill	0	Evil would be the counsellors, dark would be the day when we embarked on that most foolish, futile, and fatal of all wars—a war with the United States.
Churchill	0	But if such a fit of madness should attack the Anglo-Saxon family, then I say both nations, having long enjoyed a glorious immunity from the curse of militarism, would be similarly placed, and no decisive events could be looked for until the war had been in progress for a year or two and enormous armies had been raised by both sides, and in this war, as in any other war of this kind, your three army corps would be merely the first few drops of the thunder shower.We shall be told “the lesson of the South African War must not be forgotten.” “We must profit by our experience in South Africa, and be prepared next time for all eventualities.” The present scheme of Army increase is justified mainly on the ground of our experience in South Africa.
Churchill	0	“We must be ready next time,” says “the man in the street.” Not for worlds woul I speak disrespectfully of “the man in the street”; but, Sir, in the first place, I cannot help hoping “next time” may be a long way off.I trust the Government do not contemplate fighting these wars in South Africaseptennially.
Churchill	0	I trust they will finish this one in such a style that future recurrence will be utterly impossible, and that an end will be made once and for all of dangers from within that continent.
Churchill	0	Dangers from without can never exist in that quarter so long as we preserve our naval supremacy.
Churchill	0	Once that is lost, such dangers would be dwarfed by greater catastrophes at home.
Churchill	0	But I will not look only to the future.I have no hesitation in asserting that even if this scheme had been carried into effect five years ago, and we had had our three expeditionary army corps ready for foreign service in October 1899, even then the course of the South African War would not have been materially different.
Churchill	0	You would have had your three army corps ready, but would the possession of those three army corps have told the Intelligence officers and the general staff, and the Committee of National Defence that more than one army corps was needed?
Churchill	0	And even if they had advised that three army corps should be sent forthwith, that would not have been enough, for, as we know to our cost, not three army corps were needed, but six.
Churchill	0	See what inadequate security this scheme provides—if we are to embark on land enterprises against civilised peoples.
Churchill	0	The Boers were the smallest of all civilized nations.
Churchill	0	Yet this precious Army scheme, in spite of the thirty millions a year it is to cost, does not provide half the troops needed to conquer them; and if the scheme were carried into effect—as many people think it cannot be carried into effect—and the South African War were to begin over again, you would again have to call on Volunteers, Yeomanry, and Militia to alter their original contract with the State and serve beyond the seas.
Churchill	0	Yes, against this, the smallest of all civilised nations, we should have to fall back in these emergencies on the power of unrestricted sea communication, the wealth of a commercial country, and the patriotic and warlike impulses of a people not wearied of the military yoke.The armies of Europe are bigger than those of the Boers, and cheaper than our own.
Churchill	0	France, in this present year, for an expenditure of twenty-eight millions, can mobilise twenty army corps.
Churchill	0	Germany, for twenty-six millions, gets twenty-two army corps.
Churchill	0	Russia, for thirty-two millions, can set on foot, including twenty-three regular army corps, a total force estimated at over three millions of men.
Churchill	0	And what can Great Britain do?
Churchill	0	Taught by the experience of the South African War, rich in her commerce and the generosity of her people, guided by the unfailing instinct of the War Office, Great Britain would be defended, after this scheme has been carried into effect, by no fewer than three trained army corps and three partly trained army corps; and for this she must pay two millions a year more than France, four millions a year more than Germany, and within two millions of the total cost of the whole great Russian army.But in spite of every explanatory circumstance, after every allowance has been made, one great truth glows and glares in our faces, veil it how we may: standing armies, which abound on the European continent, are not indigenous to the British soil; they do not flourish in our climate, they are not suited to our national character, and though with artificial care and at a huge and disproportionate cost we may cultivate and preserve them, they will after all only be poor, stunted, sickly plants of foreign origin.The Empire which has grown up around these islands is essentially commercial and marine.
Churchill	0	The whole course of our history, the geography of the country, all the evidences of the present situation, proclaim beyond a doubt that our power and prosperity alike and together depend on the economic command of markets and the naval command of the sea; and from the highest sentimental reasons, not less than from the most ordinary practical considerations, we must avoid a servile imitation of the clanking military empires of the European continent, by which we cannot obtain the military predominance and security which is desired, but only impair and vitiate the natural sources of our strength and vigour.There is a  higher reason still.
Churchill	0	There is amoral force—the Divine foundation of earthly power—which, as the human race advances, will more and more strengthen and protect those who enjoy it; which would have protected the Boers better than all their cannon and brave commandos if instead of being ignorant, aggressive, and corrupt, they had enjoyed that high moral reputation which protected us in the dark days of the war from European interference—for, in spite of every calumny and lie uttered or printed, the truth comes to the top, and it is known alike by peoples and by rulers that on the whole British influence is healthy and kindly, and makes for the general happiness and welfare of mankind.And we shall make a fatal bargain if we allow the moral force which this country has so long exerted, to become diminished, or perhaps even destroyed for the sake of the costly, trumpery, dangerous military playthings on which the Secretary of State for War has set his heart.
Churchill	0	After his Oldham victory, Churchill went on an extended lecture tour in Britain, the United States and Canada.
Churchill	0	He returned on February 10 exhausted, but with the knowledge that he had acquired, through his lecture fees and royalties from his books, nearly £10,000.Churchill’s maiden speech was made on February 18th immediately after an inflammatory speech by David Lloyd George.
Churchill	0	“He had a moderately phrased amendment on the Order paper,” Churchill wrote in My Early Life, “but whether he would move it was not certain.” As Lloyd George continued, Churchill related that “a sense of alarm and even despair crept across me.
Churchill	0	Then Mr. Thomas Gibson-Bowles whispered to me, ‘You might say instead of making his violent speech without moving his moderate amendment, he had better have moved his moderate amendment without making his violent speech.’ Manna in the wilderness was not more welcome.
Churchill	0	It fell only just in time.
Churchill	0	“(My Early Life, 364).In the course of the speech Churchill said.
Churchill	0	“If I were a Boer.
Churchill	0	I hope I should be fighting in the field.
Churchill	0	” Joseph Chamberlain muttered back, “That’s the way to throw away seats.” The speech was successful; immediately afterwards he met Lloyd George for the first time.—Sir Robert Rhodes JamesChurchill Centre Note: Churchill in his autobiography was too modest.
Churchill	0	He demonstrated at least twice in this Maiden Speech in response to interruptions—one to his mention of the controversial Sir Alfred Milner, once in regard to Irish nationalism—that he was fast on his feet and able to respond with humor and clear knowledge of the issues.It has been suggested to me that it might perhaps have been better, upon the whole, if the hon.
Churchill	0	Member, instead of making his speech without moving his Amendment, had moved his Amendment without making his speech.I would not complain of any remarks of the hon.
Churchill	0	Member were I called upon to do so.
Churchill	0	In my opinion, based upon the experience of the most famous men whose names have adorned the records of the House, no national emergency short, let us say, of the actual invasion of this country itself ought in any way to restrict or prevent the entire freedom of Parliamentary discussion.
Churchill	0	Moreover, I do not believe that the Boers would attach particular importance to the utterances of the hon.
Churchill	0	Member.
Churchill	0	No people in the world received so much verbal sympathy and so little practical support as the Boers.
Churchill	0	If I were a Boer fighting in the field-and if I were a Boer I hope I should be fighting in the field—I would not allow myself to be taken in by any message of sympathy, not even if it were signed by a hundred hon.
Churchill	0	Members.The hon.
Churchill	0	Member dwelt at great length upon the question of farm burning.
Churchill	0	I do not propose to discuss the ethics of farm burning now; but hon.
Churchill	0	Members should, I think, cast their eyes back to the fact that no considerations of humanity prevented the German army from throwing its shells into dwelling houses in Paris, and starving the inhabitants of that great city to the extent that they had to live upon rats and like atrocious foods in order to compel the garrison to surrender.
Churchill	0	I venture to think His Majesty’s Government would not have been justified in restricting their commanders in the field from any methods of warfare which are justified by precedents set by European and American generals during the last fifty or sixty years.I do not agree very fully with the charges of treachery on the one side and barbarity on the other.
Churchill	0	From what I saw of the war—and I sometimes saw something of it—I believe that as compared with other wars, especially those in which a civil population took part, this war in South Africa has been on the whole carried on with unusual humanity and generosity.
Churchill	0	The hon.
Churchill	0	Member for Carnarvon Boroughs has drawn attention to the case of one general officer, and although I deprecate debates upon the characters of individual general officers who are serving the country at this moment, because I know personally General Bruce Hamilton, whom the hon.
Churchill	0	Member with admirable feeling described as General Brute Hamilton, I feel unable to address the House without offering my humble testimony to the fact that in all His Majesty’s Army there are few men with better feeling, more kindness of heart, or with higher courage than General Bruce Hamilton.There is a point of difference which has been raised by the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition upon the question of the policy to be pursued in South Africa after this war has been brought to a conclusion.
Churchill	0	So far as I have been able to make out the difference between the Government and the Opposition on this question is that whereas His Majesty’s Government propose that when hostilities are brought to a conclusion there shall be an interval of civil government before full representative rights are extended to the peoples of these countries, on the other hand the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition believes that these representative institutions will be more quickly obtained if the military government be prolonged as a temporary measure and no interval of civil government be interposed.
Churchill	0	I hope I am not misinterpreting the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman in any way.
Churchill	0	If I am, I trust he will not hesitate to correct me, because I should be very sorry in any way to misstate his views.If that is the situation, I will respectfully ask the House to allow me to examine these alternative propositions.
Churchill	0	I do not wish myself to lay down the law, or thrust my views upon hon.
Churchill	0	Members.
Churchill	0	I have travelled a good deal about South Africa during the last ten months under varying circumstances, and I should like to lay before the House some of the considerations which have been very forcibly borne in upon me during that period.In the first place I would like to look back to the original cause for which we went to war.
Churchill	0	We went to war—I mean of course we were gone to war with—in connection with the extension of the franchise.
Churchill	0	We began negotiations with the Boers in order to extend the franchise to the people of the Transvaal.
Churchill	0	When I say the people of the Transvaal, I mean the whole people of the Transvaal, and not necessarily those who arrived there first.At that time there were nearly two and a half times as many British and non-Dutch as there were Boers, but during the few weeks before the outbreak of the war every train was crowded with British subjects who were endeavouring to escape from the approaching conflict, and so it was that the Uitlanders were scattered all over the world.
Churchill	0	It seems to me that when the war is over we ought not to forget the original object with which we undertook the negotiations which led to the war.If I may lay down anything I would ask the House to establish the principle that they ought not to extend any representative institutions to the people of the Transvaal until such time as the population has regained its ordinary level.
Churchill	0	What could be more dangerous, ridiculous or futile, than to throw the responsible government of a ruined country on that remnant of the population, that particular section of the population, which is actively hostile to the fundamental institutions of the State?
Churchill	0	I think there ought to be no doubt and no difference of opinion on the point that between the firing of the last shot and the casting of the first vote there must be an appreciable interval that must be filled by a government of some kind or another.I invite the House to consider which form of government—civil government or military government—is most likely to be conducive to the restoration of the banished prosperity of the country and most likely to encourage the return of the population now scattered far and wide.
Churchill	0	I understand that there are hon.
Churchill	0	Members who are in hopes that representative institutions may directly follow military government, but I think they cannot realise thoroughly how very irksome such military government is.I have the greatest respect for British officers, and when I hear them attacked, as some hon.
Churchill	0	Members have done in their speeches, it makes me very sorry, and very angry too.
Churchill	0	Although I regard British officers in the field of war, and in dealing with native races, as the best officers in the world, I do not believe that either their training or their habits of thought qualify them to exercise arbitrary authority over civil populations of European race.I have often myself been very much ashamed to see respectable old Boer farmers—the Boer is a curious combination of the squire and the peasant, and under the rough coat of the farmer there are very often to be found the instincts of the squire—I have been ashamed to see such men ordered about peremptorily by young subaltern officers, as if they were private soldiers.
Churchill	0	I do not hesitate to say that as long as you have anything like direct military government there will be no revival of trade, no return of the Uitlander population, no influx of immigrants from other parts of the world—nothing but despair and discontent on the part of the Boer population, and growing resentment on the part of our own British settlers.If there was a system of civil government on the other hand, which I think we have an absolute moral right to establish if only from the fact that this country through the Imperial Exchequer will have to provide the money—if you had a civil government under such an administrator as Sir Alfred Milner—[Cries of “Hear, hear,” and “Oh”]—it is not for me to eulogise that distinguished administrator, I am sure he enjoys the confidence of the whole of the Conservative party, and there are a great many Members on the other side of the House who do not find it convenient in their own minds to disregard Sir Alfred Milner’s deliberate opinion on South African affairs.As soon as it is known that there is in the Transvaal a government under which property and liberty are secure, so soon as it is known that in these countries one can live freely and safely, there would be a rush of immigrants from all parts of the world to develop the country and to profit by the great revival of trade which usually follows war of all kinds.
Churchill	0	If I may judge by my own experience there are many Members of this House who have received letters from their constituents asking whether it was advisable to go out to South Africa.
Churchill	0	When this policy of immigration is well advanced we shall again have the great majority of the people of the Transvaal firmly attached and devoted to the Imperial connection, and when you can extend representative institutions to them you will find them reposing securely upon the broad basis of the consent of the governed, while the rights of the minority will be effectively protected and preserved by the tactful and judicious intervention of the Imperial authority.
Churchill	0	May I say that it was this prospect of a loyal and Anglicised Transvaal turning of the scale in our favour in South Africa, which must have been the original “good hope” from which the Cape has taken its name.It is not for me to criticise the proposals which come from such a distinguished authority as the Leader of the Opposition, but I find it impossible not to say that in comparing these two alternative plans one with the other I must proclaim my strong preference for the course His Majesty’s Government propose to adopt.
Churchill	0	I pass now from the question of the ultimate settlement of the two late Republics to the immediate necessities of the situation.
Churchill	0	What ought to be the present policy of the Government?
Churchill	0	I take it that there is a pretty general consensus of opinion in this House that it ought to be to make it easy and honourable for the Boers to surrender, and painful and perilous for them to continue in the field.
Churchill	0	Let the Government proceed on both those lines concurrently and at full speed.
Churchill	0	I sympathise very heartily with my hon.
Churchill	0	friend the senior Member for Oldham, who, in a speech delivered last year, showed great anxiety that everything should be done to make the Boers understand exactly what terms were offered to them, and I earnestly hope that the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Colonial Secretary will leave nothing undone to bring home to those brave and unhappy men who are fighting in the field that whenever they are prepared to recognise that their small independence must be merged in the larger liberties of the British Empire, there will be a full guarantee for the security of their property and religion, an assurance of equal rights, a promise of representative institutions, and last of all, but not least of all, what the British Army would most readily accord to a brave and enduring foe—all the honours of war.
Churchill	0	I hope the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman will not allow himself to be discouraged by any rebuffs which his envoys may meet with, but will persevere in endeavouring to bring before these people the conditions on which at any moment they may obtain peace and the friendship of Great Britain.Of course, we can only promise, and it rests with the Boers whether they will accept our conditions.
Churchill	0	They may refuse the generous terms offered them, and stand or fall by their old cry, “Death or independence!” [Irish Nationalist cheers.]
Churchill	0	I do not see anything to rejoice at in that prospect, because if it be so, the war will enter upon a very sad and gloomy phase.
Churchill	0	If the Boers remain deaf to the voice of reason, and blind to the hand of friendship, if they refuse all overtures and disdain all terms, then, while we cannot help admiring their determination and endurance, we can only hope that our own race, in the pursuit of what they feel to be a righteous cause, will show determination as strong and endurance as lasting.It is wonderful that hon.
Churchill	0	Members who form the Irish party should find it in their hearts to speak and act as they do in regard to a war in which so much has been accomplished by the courage, the sacrifices, and, above all, by the military capacity of Irishmen.
Churchill	0	There is a practical reason, which I trust hon.
Churchill	0	Members will not think it presumptuous in me to bring to their notice, is that they would be well advised cordially to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government in bringing the war to a speedy conclusion, because they must know that no Irish question or agitation can possibly take any hold on the imagination of the people of Great Britain so long as all our thoughts are with the soldiers who are fighting in South Africa.What are the military measures we ought to take?
Churchill	0	I have no doubt that other opportunities will be presented to the House to discuss them, but so far as I have been able to understand the whispers I have heard in the air there are, on the whole, considerable signs of possible improvement in the South African situation.
Churchill	0	There are appearances that the Boers are weakening, and that the desperate and feverish efforts they have made so long cannot be indefinitely sustained.
Churchill	0	If that be so, now is the time for the Government and the Army to redouble their efforts.
Churchill	0	It is incumbent on Members like myself, who represent large working class constituencies, to bring home to the Government the fact that the country does not want to count the cost of the war until it is won.I think we all rejoiced to see the announcement in the papers that 30,000 more mounted men were being despatched to South Africa.
Churchill	0	I cannot help noticing with intense satisfaction that, not content with sending large numbers of men, the Secretary of State for War has found some excellent Indian officers, prominent among whom is Sir Bindon Blood, who will go out to South Africa and bring their knowledge of guerilla warfare on the Indian frontier to bear on the peculiar kind of warfare—I will not call it guerilla warfare—now going on in South Africa.
Churchill	0	I shall always indulge the hope that, great as these preparations are, they will not be all, and that some fine afternoon the Secretary of State for War will come down to the House with a brand-new scheme, not only for sending all the reinforcements necessary for keeping the Army up to a fixed standard of 250,000 men, in spite of the losses by battle and disease, but also for increasing it by a regular monthly quota of 2,000 or 3,000 men, so that the Boers will be compelled, with ever-diminishing resources, to make head against ever increasing difficulties, and will not only be exposed to the beating of the waves, but to the force of the rising tide.Some hon.
Churchill	0	Members have seen fit, either in this place or elsewhere, to stigmatise this war as a war of greed.
Churchill	0	I regret that I feel bound to repudiate that pleasant suggestion.
Churchill	0	If there were persons who rejoiced in this war, and went out with hopes of excitement or the lust of conflict, they have had enough and more than enough to-day.
Churchill	0	If, as the hon.
Churchill	0	Member for Northampton has several times suggested, certain capitalists spent money in bringing on this war in the hope that it would increase the value of their mining properties, they know now that they made an uncommonly bad bargain.
Churchill	0	With the mass of the nation, with the whole people of the country, this war from beginning to end has only been a war of duty.
Churchill	0	They believe, and they have shown in the most remarkable manner that they believe, that His Majesty’s Government and the Colonial Secretary have throughout been actuated by the same high and patriotic motives.
Churchill	0	They know that no other inspiration could sustain and animate the Regulars and Volunteers, who through all these hard months have had to bear the brunt of the public contention.
Churchill	0	They may indeed have to regret, as I myself have, the loss of a great many good friends in the war.
Churchill	0	We cannot help feeling sorry for many of the incidents of the war, but for all that I do not find it possible on reflection to accuse the general policy which led to the war, we have no cause to be ashamed of anything that has passed during the war, nor have we any right to be doleful or lugubrious.
Churchill	0	I think if any hon.
Churchill	0	Members are feeling unhappy about the state of affairs in South Africa I would recommend them a receipt from which I myself derived much exhilaration.
Churchill	0	Let them look to the other great dependencies and colonies of the British Empire and see what the effect of the war has been there.
Churchill	0	Whatever we may have lost in doubtful friends in Cape Colony we have gained ten times, or perhaps twenty times, over in Canada and Australia, where the people-down to the humblest farmer in the most distant provinces, have by their effective participation in the conflict been able to realise, as they never could realise before, that they belong to the Empire, and that the Empire belongs to them.I cannot sit down without saying how very grateful I am for the kindness and patience with which the House has heard me, and which have been extended to me, I well know, not on my own account, but because of a certain splendid memory which many hon.
Churchill	0	Members still preserve.
Churchill	0	(Constituency Address)Events have fallen out as I warned you they would unless all the Conservative forces gave Mr. Baldwin the same support as they did in 1924.
Churchill	0	A Socialist Government is now in control of our affairs.
Churchill	0	They are in office, but fortunately they are not in power.
Churchill	0	We are to have another spell of Socialist minority rule.
Churchill	0	The Conservative party, although sadly depleted, is strong enough to be an effective check upon the Socialist Administration.The Liberal party has dismally failed.
Churchill	0	Its wrecking tactics have done an immense amount of harm to everyone except the Socialists, and have done no good to Liberals and Liberalism.
Churchill	0	Their outlook is forlorn.
Churchill	0	By running five hundred candidates and sabotaging at least forty or fifty seats, they have, I believe, gained a dozen more members in the House of Commons.
Churchill	0	It reminds me of a phrase of John Ruskin’s “A wreckers’ handful of coin gathered from the beach to which they had lured an argosy.”However, all this is in the past and we have to look to the future, and I am glad that in the House of Commons there is a fairly substantial anti-Socialist majority.
Churchill	0	However bitterly this majority may be divided it nevertheless constitutes a safeguard for the fundamental interests and liberties of our country.
Churchill	0	This is the explanation of the composure with which the nation has accepted Mr. MacDonald and his colleagues.
Churchill	0	But the situation is nevertheless precarious and might at any time become dangerous.The Socialist Party has gained office by making promises they could not fulfil, which probably their leaders had no intention to try to fulfil.
Churchill	0	As long as the Socialists govern the country in a sensible manner and try to do their duty at home and abroad in the general interest of the British people, no one will grudge them the valuable educational experience which official responsibility confers.
Churchill	0	Mr. MacDonald has appealed for two years of peace and quiet in order to allow the revival of trade and industry to continue.
Churchill	0	No one, least of all those would have just laid down the burden, would be anxious to deprive him of his opportunity.
Churchill	0	The Socialist Ministers have therefore only to follow the well-tried principles of social and economic progress, to seek peace abroad and maintain order and freedom at home to enjoy a considerable reign.Whether they will do so or will be allowed to do so depends not upon the Conservative party or the Liberal party but entirely upon their own extreme supporters.
Churchill	0	As long as the Socialist Government drop all this nonsense about Socialism, nationalisation of industry, fantastic expenditure and taxation, wild schemes for “monkeying” with the currency and credit systems on which we depend, and as long as they do not give away the rights and interests of Britain to foreign countries or endanger the safety and unity of the Empire, everyone will be glad that they should have their turn and a fair chance to see if they can make things go a little better.
Churchill	0	But, on the other hand, if they are forced by their wild men into extreme courses or even into foolish and disastrous experiments it will be our duty to resist them with the utmost vigour and complete fearlessness.I wish to make it perfectly clear that I consider that the late Government was a very good Government, and that our late Prime Minister and present leader, Mr. Baldwin, has rendered immense services to the country by his calm, steady, and recuperative period of power, and also by his manly, dignified, and straightforward example on all occasions, whether in good fortune or bad.
Churchill	0	Whatever our difficulties or dangers may be, we face them united under a leader who claims confidence because he represents the soundest principles of British government and the best traditions of British public life.
Churchill	0	Do not let us waste time and energy in carping and recriminations, but press forward tirelessly and earnestly with the task for a far greater and more decisive struggle with the Socialist menace, which, believe me, will be the next great political issue.There are two points upon which we ought to require special assurance at the present time.
Churchill	0	The first is about the Safeguarding and McKenna duties.
Churchill	0	* We must know and we must know without delay what the Government is going to do.
Churchill	0	This is no time to bring political spite and partisanship into British industry.
Churchill	0	We cannot afford to disturb, damage, and discourage important industries by making their affairs mere pawns in the party game.
Churchill	0	As Chancellor of the Exchequer I have borne a direct responsibility for the imposition or reimposition of these duties.
Churchill	0	To remove them would be a needless, wanton, and entirely superfluous act.But whatever is going to be done we had better know it at once.
Churchill	0	In ordinary questions of finance the Chancellor of the Exchequer is always entitled to reserve himself before the Budget, but the removal of the McKenna and Safeguarding duties are not matters of finance.
Churchill	0	They are pure politics.
Churchill	0	The new Government knows perfectly well what they are going to do about them, and we ought to be told without delay.
Churchill	0	I hope you will approve of my supporting Mr. Baldwin in raising this matter at the earliest opportunity.The second question which seems to require urgent attention affects the safety and power of the country and the whole life and cohesion of the British Empire.
Churchill	0	I mean, of course, the maintenance of the British navy at the minimum strength necessary to enable us to guarantee the security of our food supplies and our trade and to preserve the necessary contact with the widespread Dominions and possessions of the British Crown.
Churchill	0	I am very glad to have recovered my full freedom of speech upon this grave subject, with which in one form or another I have been almost ceaselessly concerned during the last twenty years.At the Washington Conference of 1921 we agreed with the United States to abandon altogether that supremacy at sea which we had enjoyed for at least a hundred years, which we had never abused, and which in the late war enabled the United States to participate in the general victory.
Churchill	0	We abandoned that position willingly and sincerely, and we accepted the new principle that Britain and the United States should be equal Powers upon the sea.
Churchill	0	I was one of those principally responsible for that decision.
Churchill	0	It was a tremendous decision, and it is irrevocable.But that decision implied two conditions.
Churchill	0	The first was that special regard should be had to the entirely different circumstances of this crowded island, which can be starved in a few weeks, and the great continent in which the people of the United States dwell so safely and so prosperously.
Churchill	0	It would not, in my opinion, be a fair interpretation of the principle of equal power upon the sea if a mere numerical measure of two fleets, each the replica of the other, were to be made the rule.
Churchill	0	Then we should not have equality, but under the guise of equality an absolute and final inferiority.Such a result I intend to resist, and I shall claim your support in so doing.The second condition which seems to me to be vital to the faithful and successful carrying into effect of the doctrine of equal power upon the sea is that any agreement between Great Britain and the United Statesmust be based upon a tolerant and good-hearted spirit towards naval affairs on both sides of the Atlantic.
Churchill	0	If naval equality is to lead to a jealous and suspicious scrutiny of every ship and every gun and every armour plate between the two navies it would be much better to have no agreement at all and for each of us to go our own way, acting sensibly and soberly and in a neighbourly fashion, but free and unfettered.Since Mr. Hoover became President of the United States it has seemed to me, at any rate, that a more comprehending and sympathetic spirit has been imparted to the policy of the United States, not only towards this country but towards Europe in general.
Churchill	0	It was the intention of the late Government, and particularly of Mr. Baldwin and Sir Austin Chamberlain, to make sure that a similar contribution of goodwill and fair play should be forthcoming from the British Empire.
Churchill	0	After all, the growth of friendship and mutual trust among the English-speaking people remains the supreme object of world politics and is to-day the surest means of the final and utter expulsion from the thoughts of men of the hideous tragedy and hateful processes of war.
Churchill	0	We shall await from the new Government a very early declaration of the steps which they propose to take in what I believe is an auspicious hour for the achievement of those high and noble aims.
Churchill	0	*In the September 1915 budget Reginald McKenna, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the wartime coalition government, introduced a 33.3 levy on luxury imports to help pay for the war.
Churchill	0	These “McKenna Duties” were intended as temporary, but lasted until 1956.
Churchill	0	In 1921 the Safeguarding of Industries act placed duties of 33.3 percent on 6500 items of goods believed to be of strategic importance, such as scientific instruments and glassware (the duty on optical glass was 50 percent).
Churchill	0	Labour was the party of Free Trade in the 1920s and did allow the Safeguarding duties to lapse.
Churchill	0	Churchill, as a returned Conservative, was abandoning his Free Trade principles in support of the duties, which his party espoused.
Churchill	0	The newspapers have been pressing during the past two months for the publication of all the papers relating to the Anglo-French Agreement, and when at last they had been made public they were very indignant to find there was nothing that anyone could possibly object to in all that had been done.
Churchill	0	They then complained that it was not all made public before.
Churchill	0	When there is nothing of any serious consequence to make public it is very difficult to make it public.When an agreement has been reached between Great Britain and France to leave off criticizing various points in each other’s technical armaments as a step forward towards the larger measure of agreement, if possible, for world disarmament, there is no reason why it should be made public until the different Powers to whom we communicated it, including the United States, had replied to the communication which we made, and having preferred to await their replies, we did not think it right to move from that position by the criticism or clamour in certain sections of the Press.Now, however, [that] the whole is laid before them, they are disappointed to find that there is nothing or very little in it.
Churchill	0	The discussion of the last two years has tended to bring naval, military, and air matters into a position of international consequence and prominence which is not at all warranted by anything in the present peaceable state of the world.
Churchill	0	Governments have been forced to examine all sorts of imaginary and immature possibilities which will never be translated into reality if any of the great and free democracies of the world are able to make their opinion prevail.In order not to give offence to anyone.
Churchill	0	I will use a parable:Once upon a time all the animals in the Zoo decided that they would disarm, and they arranged to have a conference to arrange the matter.
Churchill	0	So the Rhinoceros said when he opened the proceedings that the use of teeth was barbarous and horrible and ought to be strictly prohibited by general consent.
Churchill	0	Horns, which were mainly defensive weapons, would, of course, have to be allowed.
Churchill	0	The Buffalo, the Stag, the Porcupine, and even the little Hedgehog all said they would vote with the Rhino, but the Lion and the Tiger took a different view.
Churchill	0	They defended teeth and even claws, which they described as honourable weapons of immemorial antiquity.
Churchill	0	The Panther, the Leopard, the Puma, and the whole tribe of small cats all supported the Lion and the Tiger.Then the Bear spoke.
Churchill	0	He proposed that both teeth and horns should be banned and never used again for fighting by any animal.
Churchill	0	It would be quite enough if animals were allowed to give each other a good hug when they quarreled.
Churchill	0	No one could object to that.
Churchill	0	It was so fraternal, and that would be a great step towards peace.
Churchill	0	However, all the other animals were very offended with the Bear, and the Turkey fell into a perfect panic.The discussion got so hot and angry, and all those animals began thinking so much about horns and teeth and hugging when they argued about the peaceful intentions that had brought them together that they began to look at one another in a very nasty way.
Churchill	0	Luckily the keepers were able to calm them down and persuade them to go back quietly to their cages, and they began to feel quite friendly with one another again.
Churchill	0	The Royal Commission on the coal-mining industry, under Sir Herbert Samuel’s chairmanship, had reported on 11 March.
Churchill	0	Its principal positive recommendations were for the future; its short-term proposals involved a reduction of wages for the miners.
Churchill	0	The owners also wanted longer hours.
Churchill	0	These terms were unacceptable to the unions,  and deadlock occurred.
Churchill	0	On 1 May the miners were locked out, and a special trade union meeting approved plans for a national strike to take place on 3 May.
Churchill	0	Negotiations took place throughout 2 May, and were broken off by the Government late at night when it learned that the Daily Mail compositors had refused to typeset the newspaper in protest against a fiery leader (editorial) by the editor, Marlowe.
Churchill	0	In such confused circumstances Britain lurched towards her first general strike.
Churchill	0	The feeling that Churchill had been one of the ministers most hostile to a negotiated settlement seriously damaged his relations with organised labour until the Second World War, and to some extent even after it.—Sir Robert Rhodes JamesThe right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman has certainly preserved the calm and restraint which he enjoined upon others and, indeed, the extreme self-control which the House has shown throughout this Debate is the measure of the deep anxiety and sorrow we all feel at the miserable turn which the fortunes of our country have taken.
Churchill	0	We gladly recognise the efforts for peace which have been made by the Trade Union Committee, by the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman who spoke last and, of course, by the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Member for Derby (Mr. Thomas), who has striven with all the compulsive and persuasive powers of his nature and of his experience to bring about a warding-off of this shocking disaster in our national life.We, too, have striven for peace, and we have deeds as well as words which can be quoted.
Churchill	0	We have the subsidy of £24,000,000 which we have provided, although it ruined and shattered the finance of two successive years and which we have paid for and which is there.
Churchill	0	We have also provided another sum of approximately £3,000,000 which could be used to ease the bump where the changeover from subsidy to no subsidy would have involved very serious grievance.
Churchill	0	A sum of £3,000,000 at the present rate of subsidy, applied to the districts where the change would have involved the greatest hardship would have been a very substantial alleviation for probably three months.Then, apart from making this immense contribution in the money of the taxpayer, we have accepted boldly and frankly the recommendations of the Report as far as it falls upon us to do so.
Churchill	0	We did not pretend that we agreed with them.
Churchill	0	The very idea of finding £100,000,000 or more to buy out the owners of mining royalties implies an operation upon our credit deeply injurious to the whole of our conversion situation.
Churchill	0	We had our doubts about municipal trading in coal, and there were other points, but when it came to a question of this great hope of settlement passing away because, forsooth, while both the other parties adhered to the Report, the Government were not able to give its whole-hearted acquiescence, we said, “Never mind what our opinions on these points have been; we will make the sacrifice of those political opinions in order that the matter shall not fall to the ground through any failure on our part.”The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) asked what would happen if the owners had not accepted and if the miners had accepted.
Churchill	0	Well, as far as I am able to state the case shortly, the owners have given a general acceptance with very small reservations, and I am quite certain that if these small reservations were the only outstanding points, negotiation, and if necessary, Parliamentary action, would ultimately have adjusted those very small outstanding points.If I say that we on our side made great efforts for peace, and if we freely acknowledge the efforts of the Parliamentary leaders of the party opposite, I am not prepared, quite frankly, to extend that tribute to my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend the Member for Carnarvon.
Churchill	0	I do not think his record on the subject entitles him to censure and criticisethe Government.
Churchill	0	What is the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman doing today?
Churchill	0	He is criticising us for not making a further prolongation of the subsidy.
Churchill	0	He has criticised us for not doing that at a time when a general strike is actually about to take place in the country.
Churchill	0	What did my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend say nine months ago in July last?
Churchill	0	I have no quarrel with the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman opposite on that point.
Churchill	0	When we gave the subsidy in July last the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Member for Ogmore (Mr. Hartshorn) said they were grateful and recognised it as a help.
Churchill	0	“If it is not a settlement,” they said, “thank God, it does tide us over.” And they accepted it with thankfulness.But my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend the Member for Carnarvon used it as an occasion for derision and scorn which he heaped upon the Government, and, not only did he criticise the subsidy, but he criticised the giving of the subsidy under a threat nothing like so definite as that which we have now—not a threat of a general strike.
Churchill	0	He said we had given the subsidy not because of any considered judgment, but because of the threat that was made, and added: “Quite frankly the Government were afraid of facing cold steel.” That was the line of argument used by the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman nine months ago, when there was a great justification for the subsidy, namely, that the facts of the coal trade were not known, and had never been fully explored.
Churchill	0	I do not think it is possible for the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman to justify that line of argument which he used nine months ago or reconcile it with the kind of appeal which he has made to us to be reasonable, to put aside any influence of threats and so on, which might be in our minds, and to extend the subsidy on this occasion.I must say that among all the very excellent sentiments which have been expressed this afternoon there has been no success in evading the grim, obvious, underlying facts of the situation.
Churchill	0	The first fact of the situation is that we are told we must now continue the subsidy.
Churchill	0	All this talk about withdrawing lock-out notices and giving time for further consideration and allowing negotiations to be continued, reduces itself down to this: that we are to go on paying the subsidy.
Churchill	0	There is nothing else in it.
Churchill	0	It is no good our saying, “Withdraw the lock-out notices” when the owners will ask how are they to conduct their business at a loss, provable, I believe, on the figures, of about £600,000 a week?
Churchill	0	Therefore, if the lockout notices are to be withdrawn, that is only another way of saying you must continue the subsidy.I do not take up an unreasonable position about that matter.
Churchill	0	In the Budget I revealed deliberately and by design to the House the fact that I still possessed £3,000,000 which could be used as a taper, which could actually be used for a prolongation of a fortnight or three weeks, but that before we undertook that step it was essential that we should be in a position to say honestly that we believed reasonably there was some prospect of matters being further advanced at the end of that period.
Churchill	0	I can only give a general outline of what has passed, although I have followed with deep interest and close attention all the negotiations, I have not been involved in the actual personal conduct of these negotiations.
Churchill	0	My right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend opposite has seen me waiting about outside doors at critical meetings and keeping in the closest touch with events, but I have not been present myself, and therefore, it I state anything which is not precisely and exactly what occurred hon.
Churchill	0	and right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentlemen opposite will understand.I have, however, a general view of the position and I have the information of my colleagues here in regard to particular  details and I say, without hesitation, that the impression left upon me is that for all practical purposes the miners have not budged one inch since July last.
Churchill	0	I do not see, and I do not know in what practical way they have at all receded from the position which they then held so strongly and intensely that there must not be one minute’s prolongation of the time or one shilling’s diminution of the wage.
Churchill	0	If they will not accept a reduction of wages, and if the owners cannot be forced to carry on the business at a loss, it is perfectly clear the only alternative left is for the State to continue the subsidy for a prolonged period.
Churchill	0	[Hon.
Churchill	0	Members: “A fortnight.”]Does anybody suppose that the continuance of the subsidy for a fortnight is going to allow this matter to be settled?
Churchill	0	I cannot believe it for one moment.
Churchill	0	How can we justify prolonging this subsidy while the coal trade is being reorganised?Mr.
Churchill	0	Thomas: There is a very important point here.
Churchill	0	I only deal with the question of the fortnight.
Churchill	0	Is the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman aware that the advisers of the Government actually told us on Saturday night that there might be a possibility of getting general agreement on a basis of the Report within another two days?Sir A. Steel-Maitland: The Chancellor of the Exchequer [Mr. Churchill] allows me to speak.
Churchill	0	It was said it might be possible to get agreement.
Churchill	0	Some people, who were most optimistic, said “in a couple of days” and some said “in a fortnight,” and, as the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman knows, ideas as to the time differed.
Churchill	0	The real question at issue was this: that there would be no real guarantee or assurance whatever that, if an extension was given, we should not be at the end of a fortnight’s prolongation in exactly the same state as we are in at the present time, because the miners have never budged one inch from their attitude as regards accepting the Report.Mr.
Churchill	0	Churchill: At any rate, however many differences there may be about the interpretation of what was said and what was inferred on a particular occasion, let the House look at the plain and simple facts.
Churchill	0	Is there anyone who does not believe that my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend the Prime Minister has desired to avert this breakdown more than any other man in the whole country?
Churchill	0	Is there anyone who can dispute the fact that, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, I have as great a political interest in averting this disaster as any other Member of the House?
Churchill	0	Does anybody seriously hold the idea that the question of a small prolongation would have stood in the way if there had been any practical hope of settlement?
Churchill	0	We would gladly have made the sacrifice and, even if we had made a statement to the contrary, we would not have allowed that statement to stand in the way provided we were sure there was, not a certain, but a reasonable, hope of getting a permanent solution.
Churchill	0	Obviously, however, things cannot get into the position where we are committed to an indefinite prolongation of the subsidy while a somewhat vague reorganisation is going on laboriously in the coal trade as preliminary to any readjustment of economic conditions.It has been said, “What does it mean—it is taxpayers’ money.” It is money taken from the pockets of the people of the country; it is taken from the necessities and comforts of the working classes.
Churchill	0	Agriculture, steel, iron, shipbuilding, are all suffering too, and in some cases and in many parts, the conditions both of hours and labour are worse in those industries than they are in the coal industry, or parts of it.
Churchill	0	How can you justify the whole country being forced to pay this particular levy almost indefinitely, when there is no prospect of any solution?
Churchill	0	Anyhow, whether it is just or not that there should be a continuance of the coal subsidy to the miners and mineowners in the pressing circumstances, that is a question which Parliament and Parliament alone can competently decide.
Churchill	0	This Parliament representing 45,000,000 is the only body that can judge of the correlation of all the interests in the country.If that be so, if I have given a fairly accurate account of the situation, what is the position created by the decision to call a general strike?
Churchill	0	That decision is the second fact in the situation.
Churchill	0	The first fact is the demand for a continuance of the subsidy; the second is the terrible, blasting, devastating menace of a general strike throughout the country.
Churchill	0	The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman drew distinctions between general strikes.
Churchill	0	He said there were general strikes to force legislation, and that these were shocking and unconstitutional, but a general strike out of mere sympathy in a wages dispute, apparently, he regarded as legitimate.
Churchill	0	I see no difference whatever between a general strike to force Parliament to pass some Bill, which the country does not wish for, and a general strike to force Parliament to pay a subsidy.There is a great distinction between a trade dispute, designed to bring about a solution as between masters and men, and a general strike of this character.
Churchill	0	We all deplore strikes, but the strike has been found almost the only way, when other means have failed, of getting to a conclusion in regard to trade disputes, and organised labour has repeatedly repulsed the idea of compulsory arbitration.
Churchill	0	We have recognised it for years as a lamentable method of adjusting disputes when everything else has failed.Suppose we have a miners’ strike; as we have seen twice before it is a process of reducing people, by cruel losses on all sides.
Churchill	0	Government, miners and mine-owners all are reduced to the same position where, after the lapse of time, they come into a more reasonable frame of mind and offer in weakness or in sorrow to make a settlement.
Churchill	0	That is the process, and it is the process that British labour has always claimed to have the right to exercise.
Churchill	0	But that is an entirely different thing from the concerted, deliberate, organised menace of a general strike in order to compel Parliament to do something which it otherwise would not do.
Churchill	0	A general strike in a great number of trades, which have been selected, and of which we have been informed, in the very elaborate and thorough accounts which have been given in the papers, obviously means, if it were continued for any length of time, the ruin of the country.Therefore, the country and Parliament, which represents the nation, are confronted quite simply with the choice either of being ruined or of submitting to pay very large sums of the taxpayer’s money to one particular trade, which they do not think justified.
Churchill	0	It is really not possible.I am not going to use one single provocative word, for, after all, what is the use of provocative words on such an occasion, here in the House of Commons?
Churchill	0	Probably our words may go no further than the House of Commons, but all the more should they be sincere and unprovocative.It is absolutely impossible to justify the submission by Parliament to such a demand.
Churchill	0	We know how hard the leaders opposite have tried to get the miners to make some concession, but the miners were unable to.
Churchill	0	Time and again, my colleagues inform me, they were not able, their leaders, to give any practical acceptance of the Commission’s Report.
Churchill	0	But whether or not the miners are right really does not arise for the purpose of the argument.
Churchill	0	You may think they are right, and we may think they are not right, but anyhow, right or wrong, the position we are in tonight is that we have either got to face the ruin of the country or submit to a demand which is placed on us under duress.
Churchill	0	Therefore, it seems that the general strike turns, not upon the decision of the Trade Union Congress even as to whether the claims of the miners are just—it turns on the failure of the Trade Union Committee to persuade the miners to accept some modification.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]Mr.
Churchill	0	Thomas: This is not a laughing time.
Churchill	0	If there is a genuine desire to find the facts, I am going to do it.
Churchill	0	The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman is not correct, and I had better correct him.
Churchill	0	It is true that the General Council were empowered, and I speak officially on their behalf in saying they will accept all the responsibility, and while we were at a critical moment, a critical letter was handed to us.
Churchill	0	The Prime Minister knows we were then engaged in finding, and had already said that we believed that we could find, a formula for acceptance.
Churchill	0	That was our mutual word between us, and it was an unfortunate fact that this other incident happened that burst it up, just when we were likely to succeed.
Churchill	0	Do keep that in mind.Mr.
Churchill	0	Churchill: I am bound to say I do not share the hope that the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman had at that time, because I have been up against these very grim facts, that the miners are not prepared to accept any modification of their conditions at the present time.
Churchill	0	I am not blaming them a bit, but they are not, and, on the other hand, we are not prepared to continue the subsidy unless we see some swift finality in that process.
Churchill	0	But in this position, when it is our view and the view of Parliament that we are confronted either with acquiescing in the ruin of the country or submitting to the dictation of one particular industry, itself the interested party in the dispute, I cannot conceive of any Parliament worthy of the name, let alone the oldest and the strongest Parliament in the world, which would so completely abdicate its position, which would submit to such dictation, without making every exertion, and undertaking every expense, and running every risk, and taking every measure in its power that circumstances may require.I am told this is not a strike to starve the nation into submission, and I readily recognise the offer which was made to convey food and necessaries by the Trade Union Committee, but what difference does it really make to the issue whether the country is immediately to be starved into submission or whether ruin is to be brought upon it out of which famine will emerge in a few weeks or months?
Churchill	0	There is no difference.
Churchill	0	It may have been a wise thing for the trade unions to have done, but as far as affecting the situation is concerned, it affects it in no way, and what Government in the world could enter into partnership with a rival Government, against which it is endeavouring to defend itself, and society, and allow that rival Government to sit in judgment on every train that runs and on every lorry on the road?Our title deeds in this House—and, after all, we represent a great mass of electors— [An Hon.
Churchill	0	Member: “Not the majority!”]—We do not represent a majority, but we represent a larger number than hon.
Churchill	0	Members opposite.
Churchill	0	Our title deeds do not allow us to contemplate such a situation.
Churchill	0	We cannot by any means divest ourselves of the responsibility of maintaining the life of the nation in essential services and in public order, and in pursuance of that we are bound to take every measure, and even perhaps, as time goes on, measures which, if they were ventured to-day, would seem very drastic, but which in a few weeks everyone might consider necessary.In the nature of things that is what is so serious about the situation.
Churchill	0	It is a conflict which, if it is fought out to a conclusion, can only end in the overthrow of Parliamentary Government or in its decisive victory.
Churchill	0	There is no middle course open.
Churchill	0	Either the Parliamentary institutions of the country will emerge triumphant, and the nation, which has not flinched in the past through many ordeals, the nation, which indeed has always shown itself stronger and nobler and more generous in its hours of trouble, will once again maintain itself and be mistress in its own house, or else, on the other hand, the existing constitution will be fatally injured, and, however unwilling hon.
Churchill	0	Members opposite may be to produce that result, the consequences of their action will inevitably lead to the erection of some Soviet of trade unions on which, whether under Parliamentary forms or without them, the real effective control of the economic and political life of the country will devolve.Such a transference could only mean the effectual subversion of the State, and, therefore, weighing all the consequences, we feel bound to act as circumstances may require.
Churchill	0	It is hardly to be conceived that any considerations of weakness or fear would prevent Ministers or Members of Parliament from doing their duty to the end.No one can doubt what the end will be, but let me say this one last word before I sit down.
Churchill	0	If the executive Government of the country were at this crisis, and face to face with the situation which has now, for the first time, developed in our land—for never before has it emerged in this form—if we were in this crisis to show ourselves incapable and impotent and unable to make head and to carry on the control and authority with which the nation has entrusted us, that would not end the conflict.The Government may be brushed out of the way, but other forces, enemies to the Parliamentary constitutional system of this country, forces which deserve and require the consistent control of democrats in every land, would emerge and carry on the struggle in infinitely more disastrous and tragical forms than that with which we are now threatened.
Churchill	0	From every point of view, including that of our duty in the long interests of the working classes of this country, we are bound to face this present challenge unflinchingly, rigorously, rigidly, and resolutely to the end.The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman opposite said: “Is this then the end?” The position of the Government is not changed in any way.
Churchill	0	We are seeking peace, we are defending ourselves, we are bound to defend ourselves from the terrible menace which is levied upon us from tomorrow morning, but we are still perfectly unchanged in our attitude as it was last week.
Churchill	0	The door is always open.
Churchill	0	The negotiations were interrupted, as they had to be interrupted, because we were getting into the closing hours before this new situation supervened, and a clear and definite statement of the Government’s position was essential before possibly all means of public communication were cut off.There is no question of there being a gulf across which no negotiator can pass—certainly not.
Churchill	0	The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman asked me, “Is the Government taking the position that it will not negotiate?” Anyone can approach the Government who has authority, and can parley with them, and it is our duty to parley with them.
Churchill	0	But the Trade Union Congress have only to cancel the general strike and withdraw the challenge they have issued, and we shall immediately begin, with the utmost care and patience with them again, the long, laborious task which has been pursued over these many weeks of endeavouring to rebuild on economic foundations the prosperity of the coal trade.
Churchill	0	That is our position.
Churchill	0	No door is closed; but, on the other hand, while the situation remains what it is, we have no alternative whatever but to go forward unflinchingly and do our duty.
Churchill	0	Certainly we see around us today a marked lack of individual leadership.
Churchill	0	The late Mr. John Morley, statesman and philanthropist, man of letters and man of affairs, some years ago toward the close of his life delivered an oration in which he drew attention to the decline in the personal eminence of the leaders in almost all the important spheres of thought and art.
Churchill	0	He contrasted the heads of the great professions in the early twentieth century with those who had shone in the mid-Victorian era.
Churchill	0	He spoke of the vacant Thrones in Philosophy, History, Economics, Oratory, Statecraft, Poetry, Literature, Painting, Sculpture, and Music, which stood on every side.
Churchill	0	He pointed, as far as possible without offence, to the array of blameless mediocrities who strutted conscientiously around the seats of the mighty decked in their discarded mantles and insignia.
Churchill	0	The pith and justice of these reflections were unwelcome, but not to be denied.
Churchill	0	They are no less applicable to the United States.
Churchill	0	With every natural wish to be complimentary to our own age and generation, with every warning against singing the praises of former times, it is difficult to marshal today in any part of the English-speaking world an assembly of notables who either in distinction or achievement can compare with those to whom our grandfathers so gladly paid attention and tribute.It must be admitted that in one great sphere the thrones are neither vacant nor occupied by pygmies.
Churchill	0	Science in all its forms surpasses itself every year.
Churchill	0	The body of knowledge ever accumulating is immediately interchanged and the quality and fidelity of the research never flags.
Churchill	0	But here again the mass effect largely suppresses the individual achievement.
Churchill	0	The throne is occupied; but by a throng.In part we are conscious of the enormous processes of collectivization which are at work among us.
Churchill	0	We have long seen the old family business, where the master was in direct personal touch with his workmen, swept out of existence or absorbed by powerful companies, which in their turn are swallowed by mammoth trusts.
Churchill	0	We have found in these processes, whatever hardships they may have caused to individuals, immense economic and social advantages.
Churchill	0	The magic of mass production has carried all before it.
Churchill	0	The public have a cheaper and even better article or a superior service; the workmen have better wages and greater security.The results upon national character and psychology are more questionable.
Churchill	0	We are witnessing a great diminution in the number of independent people who had some standing of their own, albeit a small one, and who if they conducted their affairs with reasonable prudence could live by no man’s leave underneath the law.
Churchill	0	They may be better off as the salaried officials of great corporations; but they have lost in forethought, in initiative, in contrivance, in freedom and in effective civic status.These instances are but typical of what is taking place in almost every sphere of modern industrial life, and of what must take place with remorseless persistency, if we are to enjoy the material blessings which scientific and organized civilization is ready to bestow in measureless abundance.In part, again, these changes are unconscious.
Churchill	0	Public opinion is formed and expressed by machinery.
Churchill	0	The newspapers do an immense amount of thinking for the average man and woman.
Churchill	0	In fact they supply them with such a continuous stream of standardized opinion, borne along upon an equally inexhaustible flood of news and sensation, collected from every part of the world every hour of the day, that there is neither the need nor the leisure for personal reflection.
Churchill	0	All this is but a part of a tremendous educating process.
Churchill	0	But it is an education which passes in at one ear and out at the other.
Churchill	0	It is an education at once universal and superficial.
Churchill	0	It produces enormous numbers of standardized citizens, all equipped with regulation opinions, prejudices and sentiments, according to their class or party.
Churchill	0	It may eventually lead to a reasonable, urbane and highly serviceable society.
Churchill	0	It may draw in its wake a mass culture enjoyed by countless millions to whom such pleasures were formerly unknown.
Churchill	0	We must not forget the enormous circulations at cheap prices of the greatest books of the world, which is a feature of modern life in civilized countries, and nowhere more than in the United States.
Churchill	0	But this great diffusion of knowledge, information and light reading of all kinds may, while it opens new pleasures to humanity and appreciably raises the general level of intelligence, be destructive of those conditions of personal stress and mental effort to which the masterpieces of the human mind are due.It is a curious fact that the Russian Bolsheviks, in carrying by compulsion mass conceptions to their utmost extreme, seem to have lost not only the guidance of great personalities, but even the economic fertility of the process itself.
Churchill	0	The Communist theme aims at universal standardization.
Churchill	0	The individual becomes a function: the community is alone of interest: mass thoughts dictated and propagated by the rulers are the only thoughts deemed respectable.
Churchill	0	No one is to think of himself as an immortal spirit, clothed in the flesh, but sovereign, unique, indestructible.
Churchill	0	No one is to think of himself even as that harmonious integrity of mind, soul and body, which, take it as you will, may claim to be the Lord of Creation.
Churchill	0	Subhuman goals and ideals are set before these Asiastic millions.
Churchill	0	The Beehive?
Churchill	0	No, for there must be no queen and no honey, or at least no honey for others.
Churchill	0	In Soviet Russia we have a society which seeks to model itself upon the Ant.
Churchill	0	There is not one single social or economic principle or concept in the philosophy of the Russian Bolshevik which has not been realized, carried into action, and enshrined in immutable laws a million years ago by the White Ant.But human nature is more intractable than ant-nature.
Churchill	0	The explosive variations of its phenomena disturb the smooth working out of the laws and forces which have subjugated the White Ant.
Churchill	0	It is at once the safeguard and the glory of mankind that they are easy to lead and hard to drive.
Churchill	0	So the Bolsheviks, having attempted by tyranny and by terror to establish the most complete form of mass life and collectivism of which history bears record, have not only lost the distinction of individuals, but have not even made the nationalization of life and industry pay.
Churchill	0	We have not much to learn from them, except what to avoid.Mass effects and their reactions are of course more pronounced in the leading nations than in more backward and primitive communities.
Churchill	0	In Great Britain, the United States, Germany, and France, the decline in personal pre-eminence is much more plainly visible than in societies which have less wealth, less power, less freedom.
Churchill	0	The great emancipated nations seem to have become largely independent of famous guides and guardians.
Churchill	0	They no longer rely upon the Hero, the Commander, or the Teacher as they did in bygone rugged ages, or as the less advanced peoples do today.
Churchill	0	They wend their way ponderously, unthinkingly, blindly, but nevertheless surely and irresistibly towards goals which are ill-defined and yet magnetic.
Churchill	0	Is it then true that civilization and democracy, when sufficiently developed, will increasingly dispense with personal direction; that they mean to find their own way for themselves; and that they are capable of finding the right way?
Churchill	0	Or are they already going wrong?
Churchill	0	Are they off the track?
Churchill	0	Have they quitted the stern, narrow high-roads which alone lead to glorious destinies and survival?
Churchill	0	Is what we now see in the leading democracies merely a diffusion and squandering of the accumulated wisdom and treasure of the past?
Churchill	0	Are we blundering on together in myriad companies, like innumerable swarms of locusts, chirping and devouring towards the salt sea, or towards some vast incinerator of shams and fallacies?
Churchill	0	Or have we for the first time reached those uplands whence all of us, even the humblest and silliest equally with the best, can discern for ourselves the beacon lights?
Churchill	0	Surely such an inquiry deserves an idle hour.In no field of man’s activities is the tendency to mass effects and the suppression of the individual more evident than in modern war.
Churchill	0	The Armageddon through which we have recently passed displays the almost complete elimination of personal guidance.
Churchill	0	It was the largest and the latest of all wars.
Churchill	0	It was also the worst, the most destructive, and in many ways the most ruthless.
Churchill	0	Now that it is over we look back, and with minute and searching care seek to find its criminals and its heroes.
Churchill	0	Where are they?
Churchill	0	Where are the villains who made the War?
Churchill	0	Where are the deliverers who ended it?
Churchill	0	Facts without number, growing libraries, clouds of contemporary witnesses, methods of assembling and analyzing evidence never before possessed or used among men are at our disposal.
Churchill	0	The quest is keen.
Churchill	0	We ought to know; we mean to know.
Churchill	0	Smarting under our wounds, enraged by our injuries, amazed by our wonderful exertions and achievements, conscious of our authority, we demand to know the truth, and to fix the responsibilities.
Churchill	0	Our halters and our laurels are ready and abundant.But what is the answer?
Churchill	0	There is no answer.
Churchill	0	On the one hand, the accusations eagerly pressed, now against this man or Government or nation, now against that, seem to dissipate themselves as the indictment proceeds.
Churchill	0	On the other, as the eager claimants for the honour of being the man, the Government, the nation THAT ACTUALLY WON THE WAR multiply and as their self-advocacy becomes more voluble, more strident, we feel less and less convinced.
Churchill	0	The Muse of History to whom we all so confidently appeal has become a Sphinx.
Churchill	0	A sad, half-mocking smile flickers on her stone war-scarred lineaments.
Churchill	0	While we gaze, we feel that the day will never come when we shall learn the answer for which we have clamoured.
Churchill	0	Meanwhile the halters rot and the laurels fade.
Churchill	0	Both the making and the winning of the most terrible and the most recent of earthly struggles seems to have been a co-operative affair!Modern conditions do not lend themselves to the production of the heroic or super-dominant type.
Churchill	0	On the whole they are fatal to pose.
Churchill	0	The robes, the wigs, the ceremonies, the grades that fortified the public men and ruling functionaries of former centuries have fallen into disuse in every country.
Churchill	0	Even the Divinity that doth hedge a King is considered out of place except on purely official occasions.
Churchill	0	Sovereigns are admired for their free and easy manners, their readiness to mingle with all classes, their matter-of-fact work-a-day air, their dislike of pomp and ritual.
Churchill	0	The Minister or President at the head of some immense sphere of business, whose practical decisions from hour to hour settle so many important things, is no longer a figure of mystery and awe.
Churchill	0	On the contrary he is looked upon and, what is more important for our present purpose, looks upon himself as quite an ordinary fellow, who happens to be charged for the time being with a peculiar kind of large-scale work.
Churchill	0	He hustles along with the crowd in the public conveyances, or attired in plus fours waits his turn upon the links.
Churchill	0	All this is very jolly, and a refreshing contrast to the ridiculous airs and graces of the periwigged potentates of other generations.
Churchill	0	The question is whether the sense of leadership, and the commanding attitude towards men and affairs, are likely to arise from such simple and unpretentious customs and habits of mind; and further, whether our public affairs will now for the future run on quite happily without leaders who by their training and situation, no less than by their abilities, feel themselves to be uplifted above the general mass.The intense light of war illuminates as usual this topic more clearly than the comfortable humdrum glow of peace.
Churchill	0	We see the modern commander entirely divorced from the heroic aspect by the physical conditions which have overwhelmed his art.
Churchill	0	No longer will Hannibal and Caesar, Turenne and Marlborough, Frederick and Napoleon, sit their horses on the battlefield and by their words and gestures direct and dominate between dawn and dusk the course of a supreme event.
Churchill	0	No longer will their fame and presence cheer their struggling soldiers.
Churchill	0	No longer will they share their perils, rekindle their spirits and restore the day.
Churchill	0	They will not be there.
Churchill	0	They have been banished from the fighting scene, together with their plumes, standards and breastplates.
Churchill	0	The lion-hearted warrior, whose keen eye detected the weakness in the foeman’s line, whose resolve outlasted all the strains of battle, whose mere arrival at some critical point turned the tide of conflict, has disappeared.
Churchill	0	Instead our Generals are to be found on the day of battle at their desks in their offices fifty or sixty miles from the front, anxiously listening to the trickle of the telephone for all the world as if they were speculators with large holdings when the market is disturbed.All very right and worthy.
Churchill	0	They are at their posts.
Churchill	0	Where else, indeed, should they be?
Churchill	0	The tape-machine ticks are recording in blood-red ink that railways are down or utilities up, that a bank has broken here, and a great fortune has been captured there.
Churchill	0	Calm sits the General; he is a high-souled speculator.
Churchill	0	He is experienced in finance.
Churchill	0	He has survived many market crashes.
Churchill	0	His reserves are ample and mobile.
Churchill	0	He watches for the proper moment, or proper day for battles now last for months and then launches them to the attack.
Churchill	0	He is a fine tactician, and knows the wiles of bull and bear, of attack and defence, to a nicety.
Churchill	0	His commands are uttered with decision.
Churchill	0	Sell fifty thousand of this.
Churchill	0	Buy at the market a hundred thousand of that.
Churchill	0	Ah!
Churchill	0	No, we are on the wrong track.
Churchill	0	It is not shares he is dealing in.
Churchill	0	It is the lives of scores of thousands of men.
Churchill	0	To look at him at work in his office you would never have believed that he was fighting a battle in command of armies ten times as large and a hundred times as powerful as any that Napoleon led.
Churchill	0	We must praise him if he does his work well, if he sends the right messages, and spends the right troops, and buys the best positions.
Churchill	0	But it is hard to feel that he is the hero.
Churchill	0	No; he is not the hero.
Churchill	0	He is the manager of a stock-market, or a stock-yard.The obliteration of the personal factor in war, the stripping from high commanders of all the drama of the battlefield, the reducing of their highest function to pure office work, will have profound effects upon sentiment and opinion.
Churchill	0	Hitherto the great captain has been rightly revered as the genius who by the firmness of his character, and by the mysterious harmonies and inspirations of his nature, could rule the storm.
Churchill	0	He did it himself; and no one else could do it so well.
Churchill	0	He conquered there and then.
Churchill	0	Often he fell beneath the bolts and the balls, saviour of his native land.
Churchill	0	Now, however illogical it may seem and even unjust, his glamour and honours will not readily descend upon our calculating friend at the telephone.
Churchill	0	This worthy must assuredly be rewarded as a useful citizen, and a faithful perspicacious public servant; but not as a hero.
Churchill	0	The heroes of modern war lie out in the cratered fields, mangled, stifled, scarred; and there are too many of them for exceptional honours.
Churchill	0	It is mass suffering, mass sacrifice, mass victory.
Churchill	0	The glory which plays upon the immense scenes of carnage is diffused.
Churchill	0	No more the blaze of triumph irradiates the helmets of the chiefs.
Churchill	0	There is only the pale light of a rainy dawn by which forty miles of batteries recommence their fire, and another score of divisions flounder to their death in mud and poison gas.That was the last war.
Churchill	0	The wars of the future will be even less romantic and picturesque.
Churchill	0	They will apparently be the wars not of armies but of whole populations.
Churchill	0	Men, women and children, old and feeble, soldiers and civilians, sick and wounded � all will be exposed, so we are told, to aerial bombardment, that is to say, to mass destruction by lethal vapour.
Churchill	0	There will not be much glory for the General in this process.
Churchill	0	My gardener last spring exterminated seven wasps’ nests.
Churchill	0	He did his work most efficiently.
Churchill	0	He chose the right poison.
Churchill	0	He measured the exact amount.
Churchill	0	He put it stealthily in the right place, at the right time.
Churchill	0	The entire communities were destroyed.
Churchill	0	Not even one wasp got near enough to sting him.
Churchill	0	It was his duty and he performed it well.
Churchill	0	But I am not going to regard him as a hero.So when some spectacled brass hat of a future world-agony has extinguished some London or Paris, some Tokyo or San Francisco, by pressing a button, or putting his initials neatly at the bottom of a piece of foolscap, he will have to wait a long time for fame and glory.
Churchill	0	Even the flashlights of the photographers in the national Ministry of Propaganda will be only a partial compensation.
Churchill	0	Still our Commander-in-Chief may be a man of exemplary character, most painstaking and thorough in his profession.
Churchill	0	He may only be doing what in all the circumstances some one or other would have to do.
Churchill	0	It seems rather hard that he should receive none of the glory which in former ages would have been the attribute of his office and the consequence of his success.
Churchill	0	But this is one of the mass effects of modern life and science.
Churchill	0	He will have to put up with it.From this will follow blessed reactions.
Churchill	0	The idea of war will become loathsome to humanity.
Churchill	0	The military leader will cease to be a figure of romance and fame.
Churchill	0	Youth will no longer be attracted to such careers.
Churchill	0	Poets will not sing nor sculptors chisel the deeds of conquerors.
Churchill	0	It may well be that the chemist will carry off what credit can be found.
Churchill	0	The budding Napoleons will go into business, and the civilization of the world will stand on a surer basis.
Churchill	0	We need not waste our tears on the mass effects in war.
Churchill	0	Let us return to those of peace.Can modern communities do without great men?
Churchill	0	Can they dispense with hero-worship?
Churchill	0	Can they provide a larger wisdom, a nobler sentiment, a more vigorous action, by collective processes, than were ever got from the Titans?
Churchill	0	Can nations remain healthy, can all nations draw together, in a world whose brightest stars are film stars and whose gods are sitting in the gallery?
Churchill	0	Can the spirit of man emit the vital spark by machinery?
Churchill	0	Will the new problems of successive generations be solved successfully by the common sense of most, by party caucuses, by Assemblies whose babble is no longer heeded?
Churchill	0	Or will there be some big hitch in the forward march of mankind, some intolerable block in the traffic, some vain wandering into the wilderness; and will not then the need for a personal chief become the mass desire?We see a restlessness around us already.
Churchill	0	The cry of Measures, not Men no longer commands universal sympathy.
Churchill	0	There is a sense of vacancy and of fatuity, of incompleteness.
Churchill	0	We miss our giants.
Churchill	0	We are sorry that their age is past.
Churchill	0	The general levels of intelligence and of knowledge have risen.
Churchill	0	We are upon a high plateau.
Churchill	0	A peak of 10,000 feet above the old sea-level is scarcely noticeable.
Churchill	0	There are so many such eminences that we hardly bother about them.
Churchill	0	The region seems healthy, but the scenery is unimpressive.
Churchill	0	We mourn the towering grandeur which surrounded and cheered our long painful ascent.
Churchill	0	Ah!
Churchill	0	If we could only find some new enormous berg rising towards the heavens as high above our plateau as those old mountains down below rose above the plains and marshes!
Churchill	0	We want a monarch peak, with base enormous, whose summit is for ever hidden from our eyes by clouds, and down whose precipices cataracts of sparkling waters thunder.
Churchill	0	Unhappily the democratic plateau or platform does not keep that article in stock.
Churchill	0	Perhaps something like it might be worked up by playing spotlights upon pillars of smoke or gas and using the loud-speaker apparatus.
Churchill	0	But we soon see through these pretences.No, we must take the loss with the gain.
Churchill	0	On the uplands there are no fine peaks.
Churchill	0	We must do without them while we stay there.
Churchill	0	Of course we could always, if we wished, go down again into the plains and valleys out of which we have climbed.
Churchill	0	We may even wander thither unwittingly.
Churchill	0	We may slide there.
Churchill	0	We may be pushed there.
Churchill	0	There are still many powerful nations dwelling at these lower levels, some contentedly, some even proudly.
Churchill	0	They often declare that life in the valleys is preferable.
Churchill	0	There is, they say, more variety, more beauty, more grace, more dignity, more true health and fertility than upon the arid highlands.
Churchill	0	They say this middle situation is better suited to human nature.
Churchill	0	The arts flourish there, and science need not be absent.
Churchill	0	Moreover, it is pleasing to look back over the plains and morasses through which our path has lain in the past, and remember in tradition the great years of pilgrimage.
Churchill	0	Then they point to the frowning crag, their venerated El Capitan or Il Duce, casting its majestic shadow in the evening light; and ask whether we have anything like that up there.
Churchill	0	We certainly have not.
Churchill	0	I was greatly puzzled when I read the Order Paper at the form of the official Amendment of the Labour party, and now, having heard the whole of this Debate, I cannot say that my bewilderment has to any very great extent been removed.
Churchill	0	I have heard no case put forward of sufficient weight and sufficient breadth, supported by arguments of sufficient number and vehemence, to justify the very serious step which they have taken in placing this Amendment on the Order Paper.When the present Opposition formed a Government, they formally expressed themselves in favour of a return to a gold standard at the earliest opportunity.
Churchill	0	The Prime Minister of those days – I have the quotations here, but I shall not trouble the House with them – announced that policy of carrying out the recommendations of the Cunliffc Committee, and returning to the gold standard at the earliest possible moment – and then the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon.
Churchill	0	Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Snowden), went further and was even more explicit, not only in office but in opposition.
Churchill	0	He has repeatedly urged upon the Government that the right policy for this country is to return to the gold standard at the earliest possible moment.My right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend the Member for Hillhead (Sir R. Home), in his most powerful and effective speech, a speech which might almost have relieved me of the duty of intervening at all in the Debate, dealt with the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, and quoted the article which he wrote, only two months ago, in the “Observer” newspaper, and he pointed out that not only had the right hon.
Churchill	0	Member for Colne Valley advocated a return to the gold standard, but he had pressed it as a matter of haste and urgency.
Churchill	0	He had pressed it as a matter so important that, to quote his words –“Risks must be run for the sake of the benefits which success would bring.
Churchill	0	England could give a lead in this matter which would result in a general return to the gold standard”.Well, Sir, we have taken the advice of the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, but we shall hardly be encouraged to repeat the experiment, having regard to the treatment we receive when we do fall in with his views.
Churchill	0	We have taken his advice, we are actually on the gold standard, and what does he do?
Churchill	0	Speaking with the full responsibility of the official spokesman of the Opposition in matters of finance, what is it he proposes that we should do?
Churchill	0	I quite recognise the moderation of his speech, the restraint and sobriety of all that he said on this subject, and on both sides of it.
Churchill	0	But what is the course which he recommends to the House of Commons this afternoon?He proposes, now that we are on the gold standard, to deprive us of the precautionary measures and safeguards which, after long thought and patient preparation, we regard as vital to the success of the operation which he himself has counselled.
Churchill	0	Well, if you are looking for grounds of opposition, you can nearly always find some reasons, and so the blessed words “undue precipitancy” have been discovered to bridge the gap between the late Chancellor of the Exchequer’s past and the views which some of his supporters in his party hold at the present time.Undue precipitancy!
Churchill	0	I understand the difficulties to which ex-Ministers and the leaders of a party in opposition are subjected.
Churchill	0	I wish to make every possible allowance for them, but I must say, speaking quite frankly, and, I hope, without offence, that this incident makes it difficult, not for the Government merely, but for the House, to place full reliance on the character of the advice given by responsible leaders of the Opposition in regard to grave and complicated matters of public policy.
Churchill	0	They advise a certain course publicly and repeatedly.
Churchill	0	We adopt the course, we take a decision in accordance with their advice, and then immediately they move an Amendment, not only to condemn us for what we have done, but to deprive us of those practical safeguards by which alone what we have done can be carried through successfully.One may approve of the principle, one may even agree as to the urgency, and yet one may dislike the method.
Churchill	0	I heard nothing in the speech of the late Chancellor of the Exchequer which indicated any serious disapproval of the specific method we have adopted.
Churchill	0	It is a method which the highest experts have advocated.
Churchill	0	In carrying out the policy recommended by the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, we have taken every precaution which forethought, and patience, and long preparation could suggest.Undue precipitancy!
Churchill	0	Where is the undue precipitancy in acquiring discreetly, over a considerable period of time, the 166,000,000 dollars required to cover our payments to the United States for the whole of this year?
Churchill	0	Where is the undue precipitancy when we began these arrangements with the United States, upon which these trans-Atlantic operations were founded, before Christmas last year?
Churchill	0	There never has been any step of this character taken by any Government which, so far from being marked by undue precipitancy, has been more characterised by design, forethought, careful and laborious preparation.Mr.
Churchill	0	B. Smith: See the results.Mr.
Churchill	0	Churchill: The late Mr. Bonar Law once, in reply to an interjection of that kind, made a very pertinent quotation, and said: It is no use trying to argue with a prophet.
Churchill	0	One can only disbelieve him.Mr.
Churchill	0	Smith: I only said, Wait the results.Mr.
Churchill	0	Churchill: There is perhaps one ground on which we might have been accused of undue precipitancy.
Churchill	0	I was waiting to hear the right hon.
Churchill	0	Member for Colne Valley, whom I am glad to see in his place, perhaps say that he would have approved of all that we had done but for the fact that, instead of declaring last week that we would return to the gold standard on the 31st December, we had in fact returned to it at the moment of my declaration.
Churchill	0	It is, of course, a question which requires careful balancing-whether you should give a long notice in advance, or whether you should act instantaneously by giving a general licence to the Bank of England to resume gold exportation.I was advised that, if we had waited the eight months before the end of the year, before the expiry of the present Act, everyone would have had all that time to perfect arrangements for the export of bullion.
Churchill	0	Everyone during those months could under the existing law, have withdrawn and hoarded gold against the day when the free export of gold became lawful, and all this pent-up volume, which you could not measure, which might be very small, or might be very large, but, in any case, would have been uncertain, would have been awaiting the automatic cessation of the existing law, and would have fallen upon us on the 1st January, 1926.
Churchill	0	That is a season when the normal demand for dollars is high, a season usually unfavourable to our Exchequer, and at the unfavourable moment all this pent-up strain would have fallen upon our gold reserves.
Churchill	0	No one would have been able to predict what would have happened.
Churchill	0	Personally, I am not convinced that anything very serious would have happened, but there are many people who would have been alarmed, and these vague fears and uncertainties affecting the whole position of our trade and finance, would have been deeply detrimental to our material well-being.If you are going to return to the gold standard, if that principle is to be carried into effect at all, now is, from every point of view, the moment which should be seized.
Churchill	0	This charge of undue precipitancy has enabled the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman to present a consistent, or comparatively consistent, front, but his argument as to undue precipitancy runs counter to all the most solid reasons which the Government can produce.
Churchill	0	I must contrast the position of the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman with the position of Mr. Keynes, who is, I suppose, by far the most distinguished and able exponent of the opposition to the return to gold.
Churchill	0	He is the great advocate of a managed currency, the most powerful and persuasive advocate.
Churchill	0	While the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman opposite was writing in the “Observer” newspaper, articles demanding the return to gold –Mr.
Churchill	0	Snowden: Not demanding.Mr.
Churchill	0	Churchill: Advising or suggesting.
Churchill	0	While the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman was writing in the “Observer” articles which might easily have been interpreted to mean that he was ready to approve of a return to the gold standard, urging that risks should be run, and that no time should be lost, Mr. Keynes was writing in the “Nation” a series of searching and brilliant articles, formidable and instructive, in favour of a managed currency.
Churchill	0	You could not have had a greater difference than was exhibited between the writings of the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman and the articles of Mr. Keynes.What has happened in the event?
Churchill	0	The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman, who advocated a return to the gold standard at the earliest moment, when we return to the gold standard attacks us.
Churchill	0	But Mr. Keynes says:“If we are to return to gold, and in the face of general opinion that is inevitable, the Chancellor and the Treasury and the Bank have tried to do so along the most prudent and far-sighted lines which are open to them”.That is the statement which was made by, I say, the most able, most powerful opponent of the return to gold.
Churchill	0	Here is the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman, who is one of the strongest advocates of the return to gold, confronted with the same facts as Mr. Keynes, accusing the Government of undue precipitancy.Mr.
Churchill	0	Snowden: May I also quote this from Mr. Keynes:“There remains, however, the objection, to which I have never ceased to attach importance, against the return to gold, in actual present conditions, in view of possible consequences and the state of trade”.Mr.
Churchill	0	Churchill: Certainly, I say he is the most capable exponent of the opposite view, and absolutely disagrees with the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman on the principle.
Churchill	0	And yet, so fair-minded is he in judging this matter, that, apart from the principle, if you are going to do it, he says this is much the best way.
Churchill	0	What is the explanation of the difference between the two?
Churchill	0	The explanation is that the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman, unlike Mr. Keynes, has to consider party manoeuvres and party exigencies, and it is not thought prudent, in regard to a matter of this kind, about which many people entertain conflicting views, that the official Opposition should take up any attitude which, if unsatisfactory results accrued in the future, would prevent them from being able to say, “I told you so.”The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman is really in an excellent position.
Churchill	0	He is, in sporting parlance, “standing on velvet.” If everything goes successfully, and no evil consequences arise, not even temporarily; if there are no spasms of any kind, he will be able to say, “Ah!
Churchill	0	we were always in favour of the return to the gold standard; the Labour party in office declared itself strongly in favour of it.” If, on the other hand, there should be, in some few months’ time, some spasm or some stringency, and momentary agitation is raised in the Press, he will again be able to rise in his place, or write another article in the “Observer,” saying that he had foretold it.Let us see what would happen if the official Labour Amendment were carried.
Churchill	0	We should find ourselves deprived of every effective means of making the transition safe.
Churchill	0	We should not be able to secure the credits in the United States which are intended to warn off speculators-in the excellent phrase Lord Oxford used last week, to “warn off the international banditti of finance” from making attempts to overturn our gold standard.
Churchill	0	If we were left unprotected, and such attempts succeeded, we should have to make very heavy shipments of gold, and we should certainly have to raise the Bank rate.At the very time that we were exposed to this strain, we should, if the Amendment now before the House were carried, have to pay out sovereigns from the gold reserves to everyone who chose to ask for them, and, in order that there should be no risk of a shortage, the Mint would be under an obligation of minting into sovereigns all gold tendered to it.
Churchill	0	I can understand condemning the principle of a return to gold, but to approve the principle, and then to leave this country defenceless in a vital matter of this kind, when it is already committed, is a course which I am quite sure very few responsible Members in this House will care to support in the Lobby.
Churchill	0	I do not know whether there will be a Division or not on this issue.
Churchill	0	If there is, well and good, but if there should be no Division, on the whole, possibly, some national, apart from party, advantage would be gained thereby.No doubt it is a serious matter for a Minister and a Government to have to take the responsibility for a Measure of this kind.
Churchill	0	I will tell the House quite simply on what authority I base myself, and what reasons have influenced me.
Churchill	0	I do not pose as a currency expert.
Churchill	0	It would be very absurd if I did; no one would believe me.
Churchill	0	I present myself here, not as a currency expert, but as a Member of Parliament with some experience in dealing with experts and weighing their arguments, as the Minister who has behind him what, I believe, is, and what, I daresay, the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman believes is, upon the whole the finest expert opinion in financial matters, in Treasury matters, in the whole world.
Churchill	0	We have behind us the unbroken opinion of every Government while it was responsible.
Churchill	0	We have every Prime Minister and every Chancellor of the Exchequer, except, with some recent modification, the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman.
Churchill	0	We have every Committee and every Conference that has been held since the War.
Churchill	0	We have the Currency Committee’s Report, which has been available for several days in the Vote Office, and gives all our general reasons.That is the basis and the foundation on which we rely, not only as regards the principle, but generally as regards the method.
Churchill	0	Apart from the principle, I had to rely on the best expert advice I could get as to method and time.
Churchill	0	The advocates of a managed currency say: “Why do you not continue to manage the currency?
Churchill	0	See how successful it has been.
Churchill	0	See how well it has been done.
Churchill	0	Why do you not continue a managed currency?” I agree that the experts at the Treasury and the Bank of England who have managed the currency during the past few years have been wonderfully successful.
Churchill	0	This is all the more remarkable, because those years have been years of violent political fluctuation and disturbance, in spite of which they have managed to steer a steady course, maintain a fairly stable financial policy, and promote and enhance British credit.That is a great achievement.
Churchill	0	But surely the experts, to whom this achievement belongs, must be very high authorities on the subject.
Churchill	0	Surely they are the people who ought to know most about it.
Churchill	0	Surely their opinion counts more than the clever arguments of academic theorists or the interested attitude of party politicians.
Churchill	0	I, as Minister, and the Government take full responsibility.
Churchill	0	I am not setting our opinion up, but I am saying we are right to be guided by the statements of opinion we have received from them.
Churchill	0	Surely if you can rely upon a body of expert opinion which has actually conducted financially the affairs of this country with success, and tendered advice to their Ministers-a long and changing succession of Ministers-you are entitled to base yourself with real assurance upon the advice you receive from them.
Churchill	0	When the men who have managed the currency so well, according to the opponents of the present Bill, tell me that they can manage the currency no longer upon this basis, and tell me it would have been impossible to have managed it so far as they have unless they had always had the return to the gold standard as a goal to steer towards, and that if we were now to repudiate the gold standard, and introduce legislation for the purpose of prolonging the embargo, an immense injury would be done to the whole structure of British finance, surely their opinion should carry great weight.
Churchill	0	That is the advice upon which I have to rely, and to which I am bound to pay the greatest attention.I have endeavoured, of course, to the best of my ability to think out the problem for myself, and I will give the House a few non-technical reasons why I think we are bound to take this step and take it now and take it in this particular way.
Churchill	0	The first of these reasons is the position of this crowded island, which could not support its present population by the unaided exertions of its agriculture, its manufactures, or even its shipping, unless these exertions were supplemented by the world-wide interests of this country in finance and business.
Churchill	0	The great working-class population such as we have here requires, above all things, and our economic problem requires, above all things, close and continuous contact with reality.
Churchill	0	There is no country in the world that can less afford to see its policy diverge from economic facts than our own.
Churchill	0	If we tried, whatever Government was in power, to inflate our currency or credit in order to produce hectic expansion not warranted by underlying facts, the consequence of that action would be widespread misery among the population and probably lasting injury, perhaps even fatal injury to the structure of our trade.We are often told that the gold standard will shackle us to the United States.
Churchill	0	I will deal with that in a moment.
Churchill	0	I will tell you what it will shackle us to.
Churchill	0	It will shackle us to reality.
Churchill	0	For good or for ill, it will shackle us to reality.
Churchill	0	That is the only basis upon which we shall be standing, and I believe it to be the only basis which offers any permanent security for our affairs.
Churchill	0	That is my first broad reason.
Churchill	0	The foundation of Great Britain’s economic policy must be, as far as possible, based upon reality.Now the second reason is one which I think the Labour party, the official Opposition, might consider.
Churchill	0	We are not a self-supporting country.
Churchill	0	We have this immense working-class population.
Churchill	0	We have a population twice as dense as that of France.
Churchill	0	These people are dependent mainly on overseas food and our industries are dependent on overseas raw material.
Churchill	0	What is one of their principal interests?
Churchill	0	It is surely stability of prices.
Churchill	0	When prices fluctuate violently, as in the year 1919, and when, as in 1920, there is a slump, the real wages of the work-people are continuously affected and almost every step in the wage movement either up or down is attended by industrial fighting.
Churchill	0	This fighting wastes an enormous quantity of wealth, and injures the whole community.On the whole, when there is inflation and undue expansion, I believe it to be true that wages follow with somewhat slower footsteps the swiftly rising scale of prices.
Churchill	0	Great disadvantage is caused in such circumstances by the decline in the value of money.
Churchill	0	Great strikes occur in the process of adjustment.
Churchill	0	Then when prices fall, another set of quarrels begins, and serious wage reductions are demanded which it is regarded as a point of honour to resist.
Churchill	0	There, again, you get friction, disturbance and sometimes the long arrest of production in important industries.
Churchill	0	Some fluctuations are perhaps inevitable, but we must reduce them to the minimum.
Churchill	0	We should endeavour to keep as steady a level of prices as possible, and we are far more likely to get that steady level if we are not drawn into over-trading and inflation, and we regulate our arrangements by one common standard of value.
Churchill	0	Therefore, I say that what is wanted in the general interest of the wage-earning classes of this country is a steady, trustworthy, honest, and, if possible, uniform standard of value.What is my third reason?
Churchill	0	We are not only the financial centre of the world; we are also the centre of a wide Empire.
Churchill	0	If we detached ourselves from the great self-governing Dominions, which are nations in themselves- the unique glory of this country, the like of which no other nation has been able to show if we detach ourselves from their movements, we run the great risk of becoming isolated and loosening those bonds, the continuance and the fortification of which are indispensable to our well-being.Canada is already linked to the gold standard.
Churchill	0	South Africa, independently of us, was about to return to the gold standard.
Churchill	0	I received in the last few months frequent inquiries from Australia as to what is our position, and indicating what were their desires.
Churchill	0	If we had shown ourselves incapable of taking up any position at all, the self-governing Dominions of the British Empire might have gone on to the gold standard by themselves, and the Mother Country alone would have been left to pursue a different policy.
Churchill	0	They would all have traded together, and the inconvenience they suffered by reason of the conditions of exchange would have been swept away, as far as they themselves were concerned.
Churchill	0	Australia would have traded with South Africa and all the Dominions would have traded with the United States of America on a gold basis, and it would have been a gold basis with the pound left out; it would have been gold on the basis of the dollar, not of the pound, and we should have been left on a different foundation.
Churchill	0	That would have been a condition of affairs disastrous from every point of view.The same is true of foreign countries with which we deal.
Churchill	0	We have immense dealings with them, and we must have greater dealings with them if our prosperity is to revive.
Churchill	0	If the English pound sterling is not to be anchored to the standard which everyone knows and can trust, and which everyone in every country understands, and can rely upon, the business, not only of the British Empire, but of Europe as well, might easily have come to be transacted in dollars instead of in pounds sterling.
Churchill	0	I think that would be a great misfortune, a misfortune which, if once incurred, might continue.
Churchill	0	Those are the three great reasons, economic, social and Imperial, which convinced me that we should return without delay to an international gold standard.We are told, in the first place, that the gold standard will be injurious to us, because America is in favour of it.
Churchill	0	It is quite true that the universal or widespread adoption of the gold standard will be of great advantage to the United States, but, as my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend pointed out, it by no means follows that because it is an advantage to the United States it will not be an advantage to us.
Churchill	0	The great free trade economist Bastiat, in a celebrated sentence, declared that all legitimate interests were in harmony, and I see no reason why what benefits the United States should not perhaps benefit us in our special needs as much or even more.We are told that the gold standard will put us in subjection to the United States, that we shall be shackled to them, and that we shall be bound hand and foot, and forced to conform to the course of their affairs.
Churchill	0	We are reminded that the United States have £800,000,000 of gold, half the supply of the whole world.
Churchill	0	They have at present, in the Federal Reserve Banks, 000,000,000 above their requirements.
Churchill	0	Naturally we are told that if she is to use this gold, her interest is to make it as available and potent as possible.
Churchill	0	Naturally she will help us to make it the dominant standard of value.
Churchill	0	I think that is a fair statement of the argument.What is there to say on the other side?
Churchill	0	First of all, whether we go on the gold standard or not, our interests are profoundly and intimately involved in those of the United States, which is larger than we: in some respects she is richer than we are.
Churchill	0	The two great communities are woven together by a thousand ties of trade and finance.
Churchill	0	We pay every year our £35,000,000 of war debt to the United States, but that is a small part of our mutual transactions.
Churchill	0	We have to buy from the United States the greater part of our cotton, tobacco and a large proportion of our raw materials and wheat.
Churchill	0	We purchased last year £240,000,000 of goods from the United States.
Churchill	0	Whether on a gold standard or on a managed currency or on any other scheme which can be conceived, her fortunes arc bound to sway and influence ours whenever she booms or slumps.Before the War or after the War, whatever we do, our prosperity was and is bound to be affected by conditions across the Atlantic Ocean.
Churchill	0	Therefore it is not a question of whether the return to a gold standard makes us dependent on the United States, but whether it makes us more dependent or dependent in an unhealthy and a subservient manner.I think that the answer to that question depends on another.
Churchill	0	Shall we ourselves be stronger on the gold standard or off it?
Churchill	0	If that great entity of the British Empire united on this gold standard will be stronger, then we shall be in a better position to hold our own in regard to the strong influences which will sweep across our affairs from the other side of the Atlantic.
Churchill	0	We are already very strong.
Churchill	0	In spite of all our war burdens and the immense exertions we and the exhaustion that followed upon it, we have managed to maintain London as the financial centre of the world.
Churchill	0	We have the control of a vast amount of the world’s business.
Churchill	0	We have a magnificent credit to which all parties in this House have contributed.
Churchill	0	We have still, it is calculated, £3,000,000,000 of foreign investments, the interest on which is calculated at about £220,000,000 a year.
Churchill	0	Even in gold reserves the position of the British Empire is impressive.
Churchill	0	We have £153,000,000 here and £107,000,000 is held by the Dominions.Then, also, the British Empire is the main source of the world’s gold supply.
Churchill	0	£60,000,000 of gold a year, or 70 per cent, of the whole supply of the world, comes from under the British (lag.
Churchill	0	Britain and her Dominions, standing together united, are an enormous power, a power so great, so intricate, so comprehensive that it is strong enough to exist side by side in an amicable association with even a larger economic and financial Power, without being prejudicially affected in its own essential independence.
Churchill	0	In this way it is true, I think, to say that the interests of Britain are not dependent upon the United States, but that the interests of both countries are interdependent.Let me deal with another of the elements of doubt which have arisen.
Churchill	0	We are told of the £300,000,000 of surplus gold that are lying in the vaults of the United States.
Churchill	0	No doubt that gold will not move physically to any large extent.
Churchill	0	But it is possible that, as a result of the wide adoption of the gold standard in this and other countries, that this gold, which is now inert, will gradually become active.
Churchill	0	This gold will gradually serve as the foundation of credit in many parts of the world.
Churchill	0	If that is so, there will ensue a slow, gradual, healthy and perfectly legitimate expansion of credit all over the world.
Churchill	0	We may enter upon a period similar to that which we passed through in the “nineties,” when, without any violent fluctuations or improper inflation, there was a general broadening of credit due to the discovery of the gold-fields of South Africa.It makes no difference whether the gold is 4,000 feet below the surface of the Rand, or 40 feet below the surface in the vaults of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Churchill	0	It might well inaugurate a period of healthy expansion during which every one would be kept in check by continuous reference to the same standard of value.
Churchill	0	It is quite a different process to those processes of inflation caused by setting the printing press to work to multiply the paper currency, or by increasing the Floating Debt by selling Treasury Bills.
Churchill	0	It is a process founded on solid facts, and related at every stage.
Churchill	0	I do not care to prophesy whether such a change will take place or not.
Churchill	0	If it takes place it will certainly be accompanied by a gradual increase in the consuming power of every branch of the world’s trade.Then we are told that this gold may come here in large quantities.
Churchill	0	We may be “flooded with gold” as the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Member for Colne Valley says.
Churchill	0	That is not precisely the problem that has most occupied the minds of my advisers during recent months.
Churchill	0	In his carefully balanced speech on both sides of the question, the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman contrived to throw doubts on our policy, first of all by intimating how easily we might be thrown into inconvenience by a drain of gold, and, secondly, how easily we might be thrown into inconvenience by being flooded with gold.
Churchill	0	It is suggested that if gold became a plethora here, and is discharged upon us in quantities which we could not properly absorb, prices would be forced up, and we should have a serious economic situation.Such a situation, however fantastic, however unlikely to arise, would leave us perfectly cool.
Churchill	0	The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman asked: Why have we not suspended the obligation of the Bank of England to buy unlimited gold at a fixed price?
Churchill	0	Why?
Churchill	0	If you are to maintain stability, you must resist disturbing influences from both sides.
Churchill	0	Stability is equally deranged by a too high exchange as well as by a too low exchange.
Churchill	0	It is essential that the bank should operate as a balancing instrument both ways-to buy gold when it is tendered, to deliver gold when it is demanded, always at a fixed, known, and previously declared price.
Churchill	0	In this way alone can we create a financial pivot on which the whole process of stabilisation will revolve.We are in this country in a position, alone among the countries of the world, to have no need to fear a violent flooding with gold.
Churchill	0	By a judicious and far-seeing provision inserted in the American Debt Settlement-a settlement to which I think the right hon.
Churchill	0	Member for West Swansea (Mr. Runciman) referred earlier in the Session-we have a right to pay off the principal of our debt to the United States at any time in gold.
Churchill	0	If, therefore, gold made its appearance in this country in inconvenient quantities, and tended to drive prices up, all the Treasury would have to do would be to float an internal loan, purchase the gold, and remit it to the United States in cancellation of the War Debt.
Churchill	0	At every stage we should gain in this transaction.
Churchill	0	We should be paying off our debt by the most advantageous method, and we should be substituting an internal debt for a vastly more burdensome overseas external debt.I do not, however, think there is any chance of this sort of thing happening.
Churchill	0	That is the sort of thing that only happens in heaven.
Churchill	0	I think the facts I have stated will constitute an absolute answer to the particular set of nightmares which are usually felt by those who fear we shall be thrown into convulsions by American gold.
Churchill	0	We have inexpugnable means of defence if such a situation arose.
Churchill	0	But where will the gold, or the credit founded upon it, go if it be released from the United States in future years?It will go, as we believe, to European countries and other parts of the world, and in so far as it operates there, it will tend to set them on their legs again.
Churchill	0	They will, of course, be more intimately associated with the United States in consequence of their loans, but a general revival is what we have to base ourselves upon.
Churchill	0	A general revival of consuming power all over the world is the hope that this country must cherish.
Churchill	0	That growth of consuming power internationally is bound to react favourably upon us.
Churchill	0	We cannot live without exports to the markets of the world.I must take one more point – if I am not detaining the House too long – the question of the index figures.
Churchill	0	We are told that there will be an immediate difficulty because the British index figures are five points, I think, different from the figures of the United States.
Churchill	0	My right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend the Financial Secretary very rightly pointed out that these index figures are not in themselves necessarily a complete guide.
Churchill	0	They are based on different foundations in each country- 150 articles here, 400 commodities there.
Churchill	0	These figures are not an absolute guide.
Churchill	0	It does not at all follow than an absolute equation of prices is essential to avoid disturbance and adjustment when the gold standard is restored.
Churchill	0	There is a certain degree of tolerance, as it is called in engineering, which has existed in the past.
Churchill	0	It is not a clear-cut mathematical calculation.
Churchill	0	Those who found clear-cut mathematical calculations on these index figures are likely to strain the figures further than they are warranted, and to draw wrong conclusions.We all lived through the year 1907.
Churchill	0	In that year the index figures of the United States and of the United Kingdom were on a certain basis, 116 and 106 respectively.
Churchill	0	We were on the gold standard then.
Churchill	0	No violent convulsion occurred.
Churchill	0	Matters adjusted themselves between the two countries.
Churchill	0	In 1913 – which is often taken as a starting – point-the figures were on the same basis, 123.5 in the United States, and 116.5 for the United Kingdom – a difference of seven points.
Churchill	0	The difference today is less than five points.
Churchill	0	I do not see why there should be any violent readjustments or fluctuations at the present time on account of the difference in price levels of the two countries.
Churchill	0	Those price levels have been steadily approximating, and are now in a nearly harmonious condition for the introduction of such a change as the reversion to the gold standard.We are told: “If you are wrong, if the strain is more than this country can bear, if there is a drain of gold, if we show undue weakness, there will be an increase in the Bank rate which will check enterprise and increase unemployment.” I am not going to prophesy about the Bank rate, but I will say this: that I do not know of any immediate reason for an increase.
Churchill	0	Bank rates higher than 5 per cent have been known before the War, in the autumn especially, when heavy purchases were being made in the United States by this country.
Churchill	0	I am not inclined to prophesy, but, certainly, nothing that has happened in the week that has passed since we took the momentous step of reverting to the gold standard brings the prospect of a rise in the Bank rate any nearer.One thing that would bring about an immediate increase in the Bank rate would be the rejection of this Bill.
Churchill	0	It would prevent our credits in the United States.
Churchill	0	It would lead speculators to attack our parity.
Churchill	0	There might be an immediate demand for sovereigns for internal circulation.
Churchill	0	The only possible alternative to this Bill is a speedy and serious rise in the Bank rate.
Churchill	0	If we are to adopt the course recommended by the Labour party which I am sorry to say they have persuaded the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Member for Colne Valley on his responsible authority to father – if, I say, we were to adopt that course, there would be a sudden and an immediate rise in the Bank rate.I know that there is not the least chance of the House assenting to such an unwise proposal.
Churchill	0	At the same time, it is worth noting, in view of some of the criticism and attacks that have been made during this Session upon the rise in Bank rate, the probable reactions which would occur if the Bank rate were raised.The first is that if prices have been rising unduly, if there has been over-trading or inflation, prices are prevented from rising further.
Churchill	0	That is the first reaction.
Churchill	0	Is that a bad thing for the wage-earning classes?
Churchill	0	Since when has an undue increase in the cost of living been a matter of indifference to the wage-earners?
Churchill	0	The second reaction is that speculation, as apart from legitimate business, is checked, rings are broken, bubbles are pricked.
Churchill	0	If food or raw materials are being held up in large quantities for a rise in price, speculators are forced to disgorge, and the commodities are thrown on the market at reduced prices.
Churchill	0	Anything like a corner is prevented.
Churchill	0	Is there anything in that contrary to the interest of the wage-earning classes?What is the third reaction?
Churchill	0	The value of gilt-edged securities, which varies to some extent inversely to interest rates, is somewhat reduced.
Churchill	0	The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Member for Swansea (Mr. Runciman) spoke with much reprobation, the other night, against the rentier class.
Churchill	0	As the Bank rate rises, the rentier class, in so far as they are owners of gilt-edged securities, will find their invested capital priced somewhat lower.
Churchill	0	Is there any reason why that should arouse the wrath of the Labour party?
Churchill	0	We on this side of the House regard it as a misfortune, but I should think it would make an appeal to many of their most deep-seated convictions.
Churchill	0	There is a fourth reaction which attends the rise in the Bank rate.
Churchill	0	I mean the improvement or maintenance of our exchanges, and particularly our exchange with the United States.Conceive the importance of a stable exchange, a parity of exchange, with the United States.
Churchill	0	When sterling equals gold, or is on the same footing in relation to gold as is the dollar, we are able to purchase the £240,000,000 worth of goods that we have to buy from the United States on the most favourable terms.
Churchill	0	We are able to make our debt payment of £35,000,000 on the most favourable terms.
Churchill	0	The same argument applies to a large portion of the £220,000,000 of interest due to us from our £3,000,000,000 of foreign investments.
Churchill	0	That is largely payable in sterling, and when sterling is equal to gold we receive that interest on the most favourable terms.
Churchill	0	The same argument can apply to any payment that might be made to us in regard to inter-Allied debts.In so far as sterling lags behind gold, there is on all these important accounts a heavy loss.
Churchill	0	If the pound dropped to four dollars, as I am advised it might have done had we definitely announced the incapacity of this country to resume the gold standard, or as it might do now if the House rejected this Bill, let us see what we should lose-I do not say what we should lose indirectly, for that would be far greater, but what we should lose that is traceable and recognisable.
Churchill	0	My figures are very rough.We should have to pay nearly one-fifth more on our payments lo the United States, whether for debt or raw materials and food.
Churchill	0	Similarly, we might lose one-fifth of our £220,000,000 of interests on foreign investments.
Churchill	0	That is, we might lose nearly £100,000,000 per annum on our external overseas trading account, or nearly three times the present debt we have to pay to the United States.
Churchill	0	It is considerations like these which have to be balanced against the many disadvantages which follow when a rise in the Bank rate takes place.These are not matters of theory.
Churchill	0	These are all matters of recent experience.
Churchill	0	All these reactions took place when the Bank rate was raised in March.
Churchill	0	The exchanges were maintained and improved, the value of gilt-edged securities slightly diminished, the cost of living was slightly lower, real wages were slightly increased, enterprise was slightly chilled.
Churchill	0	Most remarkable of all was the effect upon speculation.
Churchill	0	The Federal Reserve Banks of the United States form a system which, like the Bank of England, is managed on the broad plane of public interest.
Churchill	0	When the Federal Reserve Board raised the American rediscount rate, it corrected and prevented unwholesome developments of speculation.
Churchill	0	An important feature in this speculation was an attempt to hold up the wheat supply.
Churchill	0	What was the result of raising the rate?
Churchill	0	Wheat prices dropped 30 cents in a few days.
Churchill	0	The Bank of England acted shortly after in harmony with the Federal Reserve Board, and in England the quartern loaf immediately fell in price.
Churchill	0	Surely that is a matter of some consequence to the Labour party.
Churchill	0	The right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Member for Shettleston (Mr. Wheatley) made a most serious attack upon the rise in the Bank rate.
Churchill	0	It was a most grave attack.
Churchill	0	He suggested that it would double the cost of building, and so add enormous burdens to the working classes.
Churchill	0	Does he really think that I, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, ought to have put pressure on the Governor of the Bank of England, quite unusual pressure, to prevent a diminution of excessive speculation, and a consequent reduction in price of the loaf of bread?Since I have been forced to deal at some length with this question of the Bank rate, let me repeat what I have already said, in order that there should be no misunderstanding, that I know of nothing that would justify an increase in the Bank rate in the immediate future.
Churchill	0	On the contrary, the situation is stable.
Churchill	0	All the evidence we have goes to show that the great transition to the gold standard has been effected so far-I am not going to prophesy about the future, not in the slightest degree-has been effected so far with ease and with success.
Churchill	0	I ask the House to pass this Bill, and to pass it with all despatch, as a matter of high public interest.
Churchill	0	The step we have taken of returning to the gold standard has, for good or ill, been taken upon the responsibility, which they do not shirk, of His Majesty’s Government.
Churchill	0	We should be mad and criminal if, having taken that step, we deprived ourselves of any reasonable precautions which all authorities, even those opposed to the principle of the return to the gold standard, unite in regarding as indispensable.As to the future, that must make its own proof.
Churchill	0	It is a decision and a policy which cannot be judged by the incidents of a few months, which cannot be finally judged even by the fluctuations of a few years.
Churchill	0	It may be that in two or three years material for forming a just provisional judgment will exist, and that the House will be able to say to the Government, “You did right” or “You did wrong.” We have acted, however, with the utmost care and forethought, we have acted after full deliberation, we have acted with confidence, and we have certainly acted with decision.
Churchill	0	I am glad to think that we possess sufficient Parliamentary power to enable us to drive through any temporary squalls or storms towards our destination, and that we possess not only the power in this Parliament, but the time to follow long views to tangible conclusions.
Churchill	0	This meeting – the first Conservative gathering Churchill had addressed for twenty years – was organised by Sir Archibald Salvidge, who had also organised the last Liverpool meeting of Lord Randolph Churchill in 1893.
Churchill	0	It marked a major turning point in Churchill’s attempt to rehabilitate himself with the Conservative Party.This is the first great Conservative meeting I have addressed for twenty years, but for nearly ten years I have been working in close accord in the Cabinet, or outside, with many of the principal leaders of the Conservative party.
Churchill	0	I do not feel, therefore, that my presence at this meeting need be taken as marking any exceptional or extraordinary departure either by my audience or myself.I recall that in February, 1922, Mr. Lloyd George, then Prime Minister, wrote to the official chiefs of the Unionist party offering to resign the Premiership, to withdraw from the Government with his followers, and to give whole-hearted support to a Conservative Administration.
Churchill	0	I, like other prominent National Liberals, was consulted in the drafting of this letter, and agreed thereto.
Churchill	0	My only regret is that our sincere and well-meant offer was not at the time accepted by our Unionist colleagues.
Churchill	0	In that event much of the confusion and weakness which has since come upon us all would have been avoided.Both the Conservative and Liberal parties in succession have, in my opinion, thrown away great opportunities in the last year or so through a sincere but excessive indulgence in purely party feelings and purely party views.
Churchill	0	If you want to measure how great is the opportunity which the Conservative party have lost, you have only to read Mr. Snowden’s Budget.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Here you find this Socialist Chancellor of the Exchequer distributing a great surplus raised by the Conservative party, a surplus gained by the labours and sacrifices of his opponents, and distributing it in the manner most likely to win votes for the Socialistic party at an approaching general election.This political cuckoo [loud laughter] – if I may without disrespect borrow a metaphor from our tardy spring [laughter] – is strutting about in borrowed plumes.
Churchill	0	This Socialist, whose life has been one long sneer at the British Empire, is able to appropriate as unearned increment to himself and his friends the whole of the fruits of the toil, the thrift, and the self-denial of his predecessors.
Churchill	0	Without that constitutional authority which springs from a majority at the polls, and without having had to do a hand’s turn of work or make the slightest effort, he has been placed in a situation where he was able to distribute a surplus for which he had neither toiled nor spun.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]What a pity that the Conservative Administration, who had all the pain and toil of preparing the ground and of gathering the surplus, should have cast itself off from the harvest which was its due, and which might so easily have been its lot.
Churchill	0	That was one great opportunity lost, and lost through an unwise indulgence in what I will call over-specialised party views.It was reserved for Mr. Asquith to cast away a second opportunity.
Churchill	0	After the general election men of all parties turned cordially and even eagerly to a veteran statesman whose sterling qualities, though tried by both extremes of fortune, have always commanded respect.
Churchill	0	But Mr. Asquith would not help.
Churchill	0	He proclaimed himself first and last a party man.
Churchill	0	Assuming airs of superiority for which there was little warrant, Mr. Asquith and his friends declared that all common action with Conservatives was improper, immoral, degrading in the last degree, and not to be thought of in any circumstances.
Churchill	0	Farther than that, they would place and keep a Socialist minority in office and beg in the most humane manner for any crumb which might fall from their table.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.
Churchill	0	]Under this guidance the Liberal party deliberately cast away their opportunity of rendering an immense service to the public, and delivered themselves over bound hand and foot to their implacable Socialist foes.
Churchill	0	How swift are time’s revenges?
Churchill	0	Only a few months have passed, but now they can appreciate the almost fatal consequences of their failure to place country before party at a fateful juncture.But what of the future?
Churchill	0	What is the great danger to our national trade and prosperity with which we are confronted at the present time?
Churchill	0	It is purely the rapid growth in numbers, in influence, in prestige, of a great body of our fellow citizens who are being taught to repeat and believe in the false doctrines of Socialism, which, if ever seriously put into practice, would reduce this island to chaos and starvation.Now it is in the face of this danger that I ask: How long are we going to continue to allow the artificially fomented jealousies and quarrels of Conservatives and Liberals to play into the hands of the Socialists?
Churchill	0	How long are the interests of the country to suffer from sterile party conflicts in the presence of an advancing peril?
Churchill	0	How long are the Liberals and Conservatives to paralyse each other so that both may be ruled by a Socialist minority?The deliberate policy of the Socialists is, of course, to prevent any common action between Liberals and Conservatives in order that Socialism may progress and devour the Liberals at leisure.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	All their tactics are conceived with this intention.Take, for instance, the repeal of the so-called McKenna Duties.
Churchill	0	What was the need of that?
Churchill	0	What harm were they doing?
Churchill	0	Who ever claimed that he was being injured by them?
Churchill	0	The trade was flourishing.
Churchill	0	Competition both at home and with foreign imports was active.
Churchill	0	The public consumer was continually receiving better motor-cars at a cheapening price.
Churchill	0	The revenue was securing two and a half millions per year from articles admittedly a luxury, and the dollar exchange was improved by the restriction of unnecessary purchase in the United States.
Churchill	0	With all the troubles and difficulties there were in the country, with all this unemployment and discontent, what was the need to pick out these particular duties for immediate repeal?I will tell you.
Churchill	0	For the object not of doing good, but of breeding strife, for the squalid and sordid purpose of maintaining the Socialist Government in office by placing a difficulty in the path of Conservative and Liberal co-operation.
Churchill	0	I am well known in Lancashire, and you would probably describe me as a notorious and unrepentant Free-trader.
Churchill	0	So is my wife [laughter], – and it is because I am a Free-trader – [“shame” and laughter] – that I regret this aggressive act of pedantry and faction which gives a new stimulus to a great controversy which otherwise was subsiding into its proper place in national affairs.The industries covered by the McKenna Duties have a serious and legitimate grievance against the State.
Churchill	0	I say that it is a harsh and rough measure suddenly to strike away the duties and plunge the whole of the arrangements of the industries into confusion, especially when it is the State which for purposes of its own has created these artificial conditions.
Churchill	0	No doubt there is a great deal of inevitable disturbance and movement in the industrial world, but to add to it needlessly, wantonly, is an extremely callous action.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	It is characteristic of the Socialist habit of mind that while they have wonderful theories for humanity in the mass, they care little or nothing about the individual home.I am of opinion that if those duties were to be removed, not three months’ notice, but three years’ notice should have been given, and that the duties should have been brought down by successive steps over that period.
Churchill	0	In this way the trades affected would have had an opportunity of adapting themselves to the new conditions, and would not have been subjected to a violent and needless shock.The attitude of the Government towards Imperial Preference is characterised by the same unnecessary partisanship, and a chilling disdain for the sentiment and interests of the Dominions.
Churchill	0	Now Mr. Snowden has gone out of his way to denounce the guarantee given to the West India Islands, and used language in the House of Commons, the only effect and the intention of which was to plunge the West Indian sugar industry into uncertainty.
Churchill	0	Again I ask, what is the object of this gratuitous act of disturbance?
Churchill	0	Is it not quite obvious that it is a party and political manoeuvre?
Churchill	0	It is intended to make bad blood between Conservatives and Liberals and to put the Liberals in a position where they can be attacked from both sides, and so fall an easy prey to Socialist designs.The Budget furnishes an example from beginning to end of Socialistic inconsistency and insincerity.
Churchill	0	Mr. Snowden has simply remitted taxation to the utmost and left the Exchequer absolutely bare as far as social reform is concerned.
Churchill	0	If any of these schemes for which Socialists have clamoured so loudly are to be carried forward it can only be by the imposition next year of heavy new direct taxation, which must be deeply damaging to the trade and industry of the country.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]But this is only one illustration.
Churchill	0	The present Government is one vast monument of sham and humbug.
Churchill	0	It presumes to speak in the name of the people.
Churchill	0	It represents less than one-third of the electors.
Churchill	0	It maintains itself in office precariously by playing upon the jealousies and divisions of the two older parties and by giving a sop now and again to the Liberals.
Churchill	0	Sometimes it offers what you might call an inverted sop, pleasing the Conservatives by offending the Liberals, or pleasing the Liberals by irritating the Conservatives.
Churchill	0	There never has been such a condition of log-rolling and intrigue.The Government has no political principles.
Churchill	0	It is purely an opportunist party living perforce from hand to mouth and from day to day.
Churchill	0	Mr. Ramsay MacDonald is assiduously courting France and Belgium.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	This is the same Mr. Ramsay MacDonald who has solemnly testified- and I am making no imputation upon the sincerity of his convictions, because he certainly was ready to suffer for them-that in his opinion France was who was wrong in the war and provoked it, and that Germany was innocent and guiltless in the most unscrupulous manner.Everywhere they let it be understood they had some great remedy or scheme which would improve the position and put an end to this lamentable state of affairs.
Churchill	0	Yet although the session is half over it is perfectly clear that they have no scheme or plan for dealing with unemployment except to go on in a more or less feeble way with the plans and schemes for unemployment of the Liberal and Tory parties in the past.
Churchill	0	As for housing, they propose, I understand, to build fewer houses next year-if they are there to build them – [Laughter] – than the wicked, reactionary Coalition Government were building three years ago.I say that these are examples of political inconsistencies beyond compare in modern life.
Churchill	0	While the Socialist Ministers are priding themselves on doing the same sort of thing that Liberal and Conservative Governments would have done, while they have put themselves off in practice and in office from their wild theories, they tell us in the same breath that they believe in those theories as ardently as ever, and that they are only waiting for an opportunity to put them into force.
Churchill	0	Somebody is being deceived.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Either it is the public, who are lulled into a sense of false security, or it is the Socialist party, if they allow their creed to be repudiated by their leaders for the sake of office.It is time this farce should end.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	The truth is that Socialism in England is permeated from end to end with humbug.
Churchill	0	The leaders do not believe in the doctrines they preach.
Churchill	0	They do not weigh with them for one moment in comparison with the prospect of obtaining office or retaining office.
Churchill	0	They cater for one side of their followers with every argument of Christianity and altruism, while another set receive instruction in the Socialist Sunday school in the vilest garbage of atheism and revolution.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]They are a minority holding office on sufferance, and are always claiming fair play for themselves.
Churchill	0	What fair play do they show to others?
Churchill	0	Even the elementary right of free speech has been challenged by the Socialist party in a manner unknown to this country for generations.
Churchill	0	No word of censure of this rowdyism has been spoken by their leaders.
Churchill	0	I read a speech delivered by the Solicitor General at Leeds on Sunday.
Churchill	0	No doubt it would be Sunday.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	The Socialist Solicitor General was so shocked at a body called the British Fascisti having intervened to prevent the supporters of his Government from breaking up Sir Donald Maclean’s meeting that he said that the proceedings of this body appeared to him and other high authorities to be highly seditious, and might indeed require the intervention of the Law Officers of the Crown.
Churchill	0	Sir Henry Slesser, if he asked some of his friends and supporters, would find them good judges.
Churchill	0	But what an illustration of the kind of mentality with which we have to deal!But my gravest accusation against the Socialist party is that they are deliberately and wantonly corrupting the character of the British nation.
Churchill	0	If their only object is to carry out practical reforms without revolution or disorder what is the need and what is the sense of teaching great masses of great-hearted English people to perform the antics and grimaces of Continental Socialism, to mouth the exploded doctrines of Karl Marx, to sing or drone that dreary dirge the Socialist International instead of the National Anthem [cheers], – and to be proud of the Red Flag instead of the Union Jack?The harm that has been done already is very great.
Churchill	0	Nearly a third of the electorate has been marshalled around these foreign standards and taught to regard the institutions, the history, and the greatness of our country and Empire as if they were odious means of oppression to be repudiated or swept away at the earliest possible moment.My proposal or policy which you have allowed me to lay before you to-night is simple and plain.
Churchill	0	I do not seek, as has been suggested, to bring division to the Conservative party.
Churchill	0	God forbid!
Churchill	0	It is a reinforcement, not a division.
Churchill	0	I propose to you that we should return to the arrangement offered to the Conservative party by the National Liberals in the spring of 1922 -and it was also the position in 1886 of the Liberal Unionists -that is to say, a strong and active Conservative party united under its own leaders with a Liberal wing co-operating in whatever may be found most useful and helpful for the national and common interest and honourable principles.Co-operation means that we should make common causes, that we should stand together, and, laying aside every impediment, that we should fight shoulder to shoulder in the endeavour by every means in our power to secure the defeat of Socialism at the polls.Such co-operation would also involve the adherence by the Conservative party to the broad progressive platform of public policy such as their leaders have now definitely adopted and formally and definitely proclaimed.
Churchill	0	That is the road to victory, it is the only road to victory of the cause which we have at heart.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers]
Churchill	0	I am accustomed at the present time rather to judge world events and world tendencies from the point of view of whether they are Bolshevist or anti-Bolshevist, and I saw in the vote of the American nation in the Presidential election a great repulsion by both the great parties in the United States of the doctrine of world-wide revolution as preached and practised by Lenin and Trotsky.
Churchill	0	I think we say what sentiment repeated in the municipal elections here.
Churchill	0	Indeed, the truth of the words which I uttered at the beginning of the year, that the Labour Party -or the Socialist Party, which is a better name in its present state of development was unfit to govern the country [cheers] have not been diminished by what has since taken place.All these strikes and rumours of strikes and threats of strikes and loss and suffering caused by them; all this talk of revolution and “direct action” have deeply offended most of the British people.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	There is a growing feeling that a considerable section of organized Labour is trying to tyrannize over the whole public and to bully them into submission, not by argument, not by recognized political measures, but by brute force.I think that the trade unions will have to review their position very carefully in the next few years if they are to preserve the great and, on the whole, beneficent influence which they have exercised for so long in British public and industrial life.
Churchill	0	There is an active and very voluble minority which is always trying to grab the control of the organization, and this minority has a perfectly definite and avowed intention of trying to wreck the whole system of society, and to wreck it by any means, however violent and however wicked, that may be within their reach.The responsible leaders of trade unions have very great difficulty in standing up to these hotheads.
Churchill	0	We must make all allowance for the difficult position in which leaders of the Labour movement are placed in these circumstances, but at the same time, when assertions are made which deserve to be criticized, I do not see why they should not be criticised, even if they are made by Labour leaders.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Mr. J. H. Thomas, a man who plays a very good part on many occasions, and not quite so good a part on some others, but still a responsible reputable leader of British Labour, thought it right to say, when the councils of action were set up: “We regard them as a definite challenge to the constitution of the country.” That was a very remarkable and improper statement.
Churchill	0	The fact that so many of the Labour or Socialist Party said they were challenging the constitution was in itself an admission, not only that they had not got.
Churchill	0	but that they had no immediate expectation of getting, the majority of their fellow-countrymen on their side.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]It is quite true that the doctrines which have been given credit among those violent circles boldly affirm that there is no need to obtain majorities.
Churchill	0	They want to have the power to rule, whether they have a majority or not, whether the people wish it or not.
Churchill	0	As Lenin put it the other day, “Fifteen per cent, ought to be enough to dominate Great Britain, provided they are all out-and-out Communists.”  [Laughter.]
Churchill	0	All the other 85 per cent, have got to be disfranchised somehow or other in order that this 15 per cent, of out-and-out Communists may be able to confer their blessings on mankind.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.
Churchill	0	]A new witness has just come from Russia whose words always command attention—Mr.
Churchill	0	H. G. Wells.
Churchill	0	Nothing can exceed the appalling character of the conditions which Mr. Wells has described.
Churchill	0	According to him, the whole apparatus of civilization has collapsed.
Churchill	0	Cities are dying, and dying fast: railways are breaking up: manufactures and commerce of all kinds are at a standstill.
Churchill	0	Mr. Wells said:“I find an irreparable breakdown of the great monarchy that was here in 1914.
Churchill	0	The administrative, social, financial, commercial systems connected with it have fallen down under the strain of war.
Churchill	0	and are smashed utterly.
Churchill	0	Never has there been so great a debacle before.”Of course Mr. Wells has to vindicate his theories.
Churchill	0	He suggests that this irreparable catastrophe is not the fault of the Bolshevists.
Churchill	0	But I submit as a most unchallengable conviction that those disasters in Russia are solely due to the Bolshevists, and are solely due to a very few men.
Churchill	0	to a revolutionary and terrible sect of fanatics, whose devastating doctrines have laid Russia low.
Churchill	0	and will lay every nation low in which they obtain ascendancy.Mr.
Churchill	0	Wells attributes Russia’s downfall to the inherent rottenness of Capitalism, Imperialism, and the war.
Churchill	0	What arrant nonsense!
Churchill	0	The Bolshevists did it.
Churchill	0	and they alone to the utmost generation of mankind will feel this fearful responsibility.
Churchill	0	No doubt the war struck Russia a heavy blow, but none from which she could not have survived.
Churchill	0	It was a deadly and paralysing sect that destroyed Russia and plunged it deep into unspeakable misery.
Churchill	0	We must never cease proclaiming this fact as a warning to other nations in the world, and for the preservation of our own country.
Churchill	0	The Bolshevists are responsible for the catastrophe.For Russia we can do little.
Churchill	0	The fearful series of events must run their course.
Churchill	0	One can only hope that some day in our own time deliverance will come to the Russian people and that they will stand again on their own feet and be masters in their own house.But if we can do little for Russia, we can do much for Britain.
Churchill	0	We do not want any of these experiments here.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Any such experiments in this country would be followed by the destruction of the great majority of the persons dwelling in these islands.
Churchill	0	We can at any rate make sure that in our life and time the deadly disease which has struck down Russia should not be allowed to spring up here and poison us as it is poisoning them.In every city there are small bands of eager men and women, watching with hungry eyes any chance to make a general overturn in the hopes of profiting themselves in the confusion, and these miscreants are fed by Bolshevist money.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	They are ceaselessly endeavouring by propagating the doctrines of communism, by preaching violent revolution, by inflaming discontent, to infect us with their disease.
Churchill	0	If there is no danger it is only because we have an enlightened, active political life in Britain, because we have a considered, instructed, organized public opinion, and because we have a free Constitution which we are determined to make an instrument of continuous and progressive reform.
Churchill	0	In order that that condition shall be maintained, ceaseless political exertion must be made in all parts of the country by citizens in every class, each using to the full his political rights.The danger at the present time does not exist only, or even mainly, in these islands.
Churchill	0	What of India, Egypt, and Ireland?
Churchill	0	Do you not think it possible that there is some connection between all the revolutionary and subversive elements by which we are now being assailed?
Churchill	0	When we see all these movements from so many different quarters springing up simultaneously, does it not look as though there is a dead set being made against the British Empire?
Churchill	0	Why, for instance, should the Egyptian extremists give money to the Daily Herald?’ [Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Why does Lenin send them money, too?
Churchill	0	Why does he also send money to Sinn Fein?
Churchill	0	We know that intense efforts are being made to disturb India, and that similar efforts are being made to cause a great breakdown of trade and industry at home in the hopes of creating unemployment and consequently suffering and discontent.It is becoming increasingly clear that all these factions are in touch with one another, and that they are acting in concert.
Churchill	0	In fact there is developing a world-wide conspiracy against our country, designed to deprive us of our place in the world and to rob us of the fruits of victory.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	They will not succeed.
Churchill	0	They will fail.
Churchill	0	We must be ready: we must be on our guard to recognize every symptom of danger, and to act with strong conviction against it.
Churchill	0	Having beaten the most powerful military empire in the world, having emerged triumphantly from the fearful ordeal of Armageddon, we will not allow ourselves to be pulled down and have our Empire disrupted by a malevolent and subversive force, the rascals and rapscallions of mankind who are now on the move against us.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.
Churchill	0	]Whether it is the Irish murder gang or the Egyptian vengeance society, or the seditious extremists in India, or the arch-traitors we have at home, they will feel the weight of the British arm.
Churchill	0	It was strong enough to break the Hindenburg Line, it will be strong enough to defend the main interests of the British people, to carry us through these stormy times into calmer and brighter days.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	The Ministerial Crisis of May 1915 is a highly complex episode in British political history The immediate cause was Lord Fisher’s resignation on May 15, but other elements—notably a sensational attack in the Times the previous day, alleging a severe shell shortage in France—played their part.
Churchill	0	A reconstruction of the Government was inevitable and after days of complex negotiations the first Coalition Government of the war was formed.
Churchill	0	Churchill’s removal from the Admiralty was a sine qua non for the Opposition.
Churchill	0	He struggled desperately to remain, but the pressures upon Asquith and not only from the Opposition were too great.
Churchill	0	He became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with a seat in the Cabinet.
Churchill	0	It was a shattering demotion.
Churchill	0	“At a moment when every fibre of my being was inflamed to action ” he subsequently wrote, “I was forced to remain a spectator of the tragedy.
Churchill	0	“On June 5, in his constituency, he defended his role in the Dardanelles.
Churchill	0	— RRJI thought it right to take an opportunity of coming here to my constituency in view of all the events which have recently taken place, and also of the fact that considerably more than a year has passed since I have had the opportunity of speaking in Dundee.
Churchill	0	I have not come here to trouble you with personal matters, or to embark on explanations or to indulge in reproaches or recriminations.
Churchill	0	In war time a man must do his duty as he sees it, and take his luck as it comes or goes.
Churchill	0	I will not say a word here or in Parliament which I cannot truly feel will have a useful bearing upon the only thing that matters, upon the only thing I care about, and the only thing I want you to think about—namely, the waging of victorious war upon the enemy.
Churchill	0	[Cheers] I was sent to the Admiralty in 1911, after the Agadir crisis had nearly brought us into war, and I was sent with the express duty laid upon me by the Prime Minister to put the Fleet in a state of instant and constant readiness for war in case we were attacked by Germany.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Since then, for nearly four years, I have borne the heavy burden of being, according to the time-honoured language of my patent, “responsible to Crown and Parliament for all the business of the Admiralty,” and when I say responsible, I have been responsible in the real sense, that I have had the blame for everything that has gone wrong.
Churchill	0	[Laughter and cheers.]
Churchill	0	These years have comprised the most important period in our naval history a period of preparation for war, a period of vigilance and mobilization, and a period of actual war under conditions of which no man has any experience.
Churchill	0	I have done my best, [cheers], and the archives of the Admiralty will show in the utmost detail the part I have played in all the great transactions that have taken place.
Churchill	0	It is to them I look for my defense.I look also to the general naval situation.
Churchill	0	The terrible dangers of the beginning of the war are over.
Churchill	0	The seas have been swept clear: the submarine menace has been fixed within definite limits; the personal ascendency of our men, the superior quality of our ships on the high seas, has been established beyond doubt or question.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Our strength has greatly increased, actually and relatively from what it was in the beginning of the war, and it grows continually every day by leaps and bounds in all the classes of vessels needed for the special purpose of the war.
Churchill	0	Between now and the end of the year, the British Navy will receive reinforcements which would be incredible if they were not actual facts.
Churchill	0	Everything is in perfect order.
Churchill	0	Nearly everything has been foreseen, all our supplies, stores, ammunition, and appliances of every kind, our supplies and drafts of officers and men—all are there.
Churchill	0	Nowhere will you be hindered.
Churchill	0	You have taken the measure of your foe, you have only to go forward with confidence.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	On the whole surface of the seas of the world no hostile flag is flown.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.
Churchill	0	]In that achievement I shall always be proud to have had a share.
Churchill	0	My charge now passes to another hand, and it is my duty to do everything in my power to give to my successor loyal support in act, in word, and in thought.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I am very glad indeed that Mr. Balfour [cheers] has been able to undertake this great task.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	The operations which are now proceeding at the Dardanelles will give him the opportunity of using that quality of cool, calm courage and inflexibility which 15 years ago prevented Ladysmith from being left to its fate and surrendered to the enemy.I have two things to say to you about the Dardanelles.
Churchill	0	First, you must expect losses both by land and sea; but the Fleet you are employing there is your surplus Fleet, after all other needs have been provided for.
Churchill	0	Had it not been used in this great enterprise, it would have been lying idle in your southern ports.
Churchill	0	A large number of the old vessels of which it is composed have to be laid up, in any case, before the end of the year, because their crews are wanted for the enormous reinforcements of new ships which the industry of your workshops is hurrying into the water.
Churchill	0	Losses of ships, therefore, as long as the precious lives of the officers and men are saved, as in nearly every case they have been—losses of that kind, I say, may easily be exaggerated in the minds both of friend and foe.And military operations will also be costly, but those who suppose that Lord Kitchener [loud cheers] has embarked upon them without narrowly and carefully considering their requirements in relation to all other needs and in relation to the paramount need of our Army in France and Flanders such people are mistaken and, not only mistaken, they are presumptuous.My second point is this in looking at your losses squarely and soberly, you must not forget, at the same time, the prize for which you are contending.
Churchill	0	The Army of Sir Ian Hamilton, the Fleet of Admiral de Robeck, are separated only by a few miles from a victory such as this war has not yet seen.
Churchill	0	When I speak of victory, I am not referring to those victories which crowd the daily placards of any newspapers.
Churchill	0	I am speaking of victory in the sense of a brilliant and formidable fact, shaping the destinies of nations and shortening the duration of the war.
Churchill	0	Beyond those few miles of ridge and scrub on which our soldiers, our French comrades, our gallant Australians, and our New Zealand fellow-subjects are now battling, lie the downfall of a hostile empire, the destruction of an enemy’s fleet and army, the fall of a world-famous capital, and probably the accession of powerful Allies.
Churchill	0	The struggle will be heavy, the risks numerous, the losses cruel; but victory when it comes will make amends for all.There never was a great subsidiary operation of war in which a more complete harmony of strategic, political, and economic advantages has combined, or which stood in truer relation to the main decision which is in the central theatre.
Churchill	0	Through the narrows of the Dardanelles and across the ridges of the Gallipoli Peninsula lie some of the shortest paths to a triumphant peace.
Churchill	0	That is all I say upon that subject this afternoon; but later on, perhaps, when the concluding chapters in this famous story have been written, I may be allowed to return again to the subject.I am not with the croakers.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I see some of our newspaper friends are reproaching themselves and reproaching others for having been too optimistic.
Churchill	0	Let them lay their consciences to rest.
Churchill	0	It is the general duty of the Press, for the most part faithfully discharged, to sustain the public confidence and spirit in time of war.
Churchill	0	All the great commanders of the past, the rulers of States in time of crises, have always laboured to discourage pessimism by every means in their power.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Our Allies the French have a recent saying that pessimism in the civilian is the counterpart of cowardice in the soldier.
Churchill	0	That does not mean you must not face facts.
Churchill	0	You should face facts, but surely from the facts of our situation you will find the means of deriving much encouragement.Why, when we look back and remember that we entered this conflict of military nations, of great States prepared mainly for war, that we entered this conflict ten months ago a powerful civilian nation, that no part of our national life, excepting always the Navy [cheers]—the British Navy was as ready as the German Army [loud cheers] and has proved itself more equal to its task [cheers]—but when we remember that no part of our national life, except the Navy, was adapted to war on a great scale, have we not in all that has happened since much to be proud of and much to be thankful for?
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Is it not wonderful, for instance, that after so many years of peace we should have found ready to hand a Kitchener to recruit and organize our armies [cheers], a dauntless leader like Sir John French to command them [cheers], skilful generals like Sir Douglas Haig, Sir Ian Hamilton, a naval Commander-in-Chief like Sir John Jellicoe.
Churchill	0	Admirals like Beatty and Sturdee and De Robeck, and the gallant commodore who flies his broad pennant in the saucy Arethusa?
Churchill	0	And depend upon it behind them there are many more only waiting for the golden gleam of opportunity to perform surprising deeds of men in our cause.It is the duty of all in times like these to give loyalty and confidence to their leaders, be they the soldiers in the active sphere or the statesmen who sit in anxious council here at home, to give them loyalty and confidence, not only when all goes smoothly, for that is easy, but to make them feel that they will not be blamed for necessary losses incurred in valiant enterprise or rounded on in reproach at the first check or twist of fortune.
Churchill	0	Then you will get from your leaders, be they military or civilian, you will get from them the courage, the energy, the audacity, and readiness to run all risks and shoulder the responsibilities without which no great result in war can ever be achieved.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Now I would like to say something which will get me into trouble.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	I do not think that the newspapers ought to be allowed to attack the responsible leaders of the nation [loud cheers], whether in the field or at home, or to write in a manner which is calculated to spread doubts and want of confidence in them or in particular operations, or to write anything which is calculated to make bad blood between them.
Churchill	0	I apply this not only to the Admirals and Generals, but to the principal Ministers at home, and especially the heads of the great fighting departments.
Churchill	0	No other nation now at war would allow the newspapers such a license in the present time, and if there is to be criticism, if there must be criticism, first, it should be only the loyal criticism of earnest intention.
Churchill	0	But if there is to be criticism, let it be in Parliament.
Churchill	0	If the speeches are such that we cannot allow the enemy to be a party to our discussions, then let Parliament, as is its right, sit for the time being with closed doors.
Churchill	0	But it seems imperative, in the interests of the country for the future, and for the safety and success of our arms, that irresponsible or malicious carping should not continue.We in this country are the firm supporters of a free Press.
Churchill	0	A free Press is a natural and healthy feature in national life, so long as you have also a free Parliament and a free platform; but when, owing to war conditions, Parliament observes a voluntary but severe restraint, and when many of the subjects cannot be freely discussed without giving information to the enemy, then the balance of society is no longer true and grave injury results from the unrestricted action of the newspapers.I have very much regretted that the Liberal Government which is now no more had no opportunity of stating its case in Parliament.
Churchill	0	It would, I think, have been found that Lord Kitchener had a very strong case to unfold on behalf of the War Office, and even I might have had something to say on behalf of the Admiralty; but the Government has perished, its long career, so memorable in our home affairs, is ended, its work whether in South Africa or Ireland has passed for good or for ill into history.
Churchill	0	I know that there are gathered here this afternoon many of those who were its opponents, and that we are going to work together on a different basis now; but before I come to the new Government and its prospects, I must ask your leave and your courtesy to say a few words in justice to the old.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]There was a Government which sought peace long and faithfully and to the end, but which, nevertheless, maintained our naval defence so that all the needs and dangers were provided against; there was a Government who placed in the field six times as many divisions of soldiers as had ever been contemplated by any party in the State at any time in our history; there was a Government which fulfilled in your name, in the name of the nation, every obligation of duty and of honour to France and to Belgium [cheers]; there was a Government which brought us into the war a united people and with such a record that in future times, when the wounded world looks back with its searching scrutiny upon all the events which have led up to this great catastrophe—will leave us such a record as will show to all time that Britain was absolutely guiltless of the slightest stain.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I thought you would permit me to say these few words about the Liberal Administration of which I have had the honour to remain for so many years a member, and that I might say them in justice to those who compose it and to the Chief who led it, and to the great party which so faithfully sustained it.And before I leave it I would ask your leave to say a word about a great friend of mine, well-known to you in Scotland and passed now out of public life—Lord Haldane.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	I deeply regret that he has ceased to fill the great office which he adorned.
Churchill	0	No more sincere patriot has served the Crown.
Churchill	0	There never has been an occasion in the Cabinets of the last seven years in which I have sat, that, as the need arose, Lord Haldane has not from his great knowledge of the German governmental system warned us to be on our guard against the dangerous side of their nature.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	There never has been a time when he has not supported every provision for the defence of this country, military or naval.
Churchill	0	He it was who entered into those intricate arrangements with France which enabled our Army to be so swiftly brought to the scene of action, just in the nick of time.
Churchill	0	He it was who prepared that Expeditionary Army in the face of much opposition and in days when every penny was hard to get.
Churchill	0	He it was who organized the Territorial Force [cheers], which has so splendidly vindicated itself and its founder, and upon whose gallantry, discipline, and numbers the weight and even the success of our military operations hitherto have notably if not mainly depended.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Till a few months ago all the land forces which we employed in this war, which we put in the field, were the products of Lord Haldane’s organization, and in the fateful and convulsive days before Great Britain drew the sword of honour, when the chill of doubt struck into many hearts, whether we should act as we were bound—in those days no man stood closer to Sir Edward Grey and no man saw more clearly where our duty led us.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]With that I leave the past.
Churchill	0	A new Government has been formed, old opponents have laid aside their differences, personal interests and party interests have been adjusted or suppressed, and the Administration may now claim to represent the political energies and abilities and to command the loyalties of a united nation.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	To support that Government, to make it a success, to make it an efficient instrument for waging war, to be loyal to it, to treat it fairly, and judge it with consideration and respect is not a matter of likes and dislikes, not a matter of ordinary political choice or option.
Churchill	0	It is for all of us a matter of self-preservation.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	For nearly three weeks the country has had its attention diverted from the war by the business of Cabinet making and the dividing of offices and honours, and all those commonplace but necessary details of our political system which are so entertaining in time of peace.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.
Churchill	0	]Now that is all over.
Churchill	0	It has taken long enough, but it is over, and I ask myself this question—What does the nation expect of the new National Government?
Churchill	0	I can answer my question.
Churchill	0	I am going to answer it in one word—action.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	That is the need, that is the only justification, that there should be a stronger national sentiment, a more powerful driving force, a greater measure of consent in the people, a greater element of leadership and design in the rulers—that is what all parties expect and require in return for the many sacrifices which all parties have after due consideration made from their particular interests and ideals.
Churchill	0	Action—action, not hesitation; action, not words; action, not agitation.
Churchill	0	The nation waits its orders.
Churchill	0	The duty lies upon the Government to declare what should be done, to propose it to Parliament, and to stand or fall by the result.
Churchill	0	That is the message which you wish me to take back to London — Act; act now; act with faith and courage.
Churchill	0	Trust the people.
Churchill	0	They have never failed you yet.Long speeches are not suited to the times in which we live, and, therefore, I shall detain you only a very few minutes more.
Churchill	0	As to the rights of the State in the hour of supreme need over all its subjects there can be no dispute.
Churchill	0	They are absolute.
Churchill	0	Nothing matters but that the nation lives and preserves that freedom without which life would be odious.
Churchill	0	The only question which arises is as to the degree to which it is necessary to exercise these indisputable rights.
Churchill	0	Now, I say frankly to you that if it were not possible to win this war without taking men by compulsion and sending them into the field, I should support such a measure; but I do not believe that it will be found necessary [cheers], and I am sure it is not necessary now.
Churchill	0	On the contrary, such is the character of our people that the only places which will never lack volunteers are the bloody trenches of France and Flanders.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]No nation has never at any time in history found such a spirit of daring and sacrifice widespread, almost universal, in the masses of its people.
Churchill	0	The French Revolution could not defend the soil of France without compulsion.
Churchill	0	The American Commonwealth could not maintain the integrity of its State without compulsion, but modern Britain has found millions of citizens who all of their own free will have eagerly or soberly resolved to fight and die for the principles at stake and to fight and die in the hardest, the cruellest, and the least rewarded of all the wars that men have fought.
Churchill	0	Why, that is one of the most wonderful and inspiring facts in the whole history of this wonderful island, and in afterdays, depend upon it, it will be taken as a splendid signal of the manhood of our race and of the soundness of our institutions.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]And having got so far, being now on the high road to three millions of men in the service of the Crown as Volunteers—having gone so far, to cast away this great moral advantage which adds to the honour of our Armies and to the dignity of our State, simply for the purpose of hustling into the firing line a comparatively small proportion of persons, themselves not, perhaps, the best suited to the job, who, even when taken, could not be for many months equipped to do that after all that happened would, it seems to me, be unwise in the extreme.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.
Churchill	0	]But service at home, service for home defence and to keep our fighting men abroad properly supplied and maintained, that seems to me to stand on a different footing.
Churchill	0	Remember, we are confronted with a foe who would without the slightest scruple extirpate us, man, woman, and child, by any method open to him if he had the opportunity.
Churchill	0	We are fighting a foe who would not hesitate one moment to obliterate every single soul in this great country this afternoon if it could be done by pressing a button.
Churchill	0	We are fighting a foe who would think as little of that as a gardener would think of smoking out a wasps’ nest.
Churchill	0	Let us recognize that this is a new fact in the history of the world [cheers] or, rather, it is an old fact, sprung up out of the horrible abysses of the past.We are fighting with a foe of that kind, and we are locked in mortal struggle.
Churchill	0	To fail is to be enslaved, or, at the very best, to be destroyed.
Churchill	0	Not to win decisively is to have all this misery over again after an uneasy truce, and to fight it over again, probably under less favourable circumstances and, perhaps, alone.
Churchill	0	Why, after what has happened, there could never be peace in Europe until the German military system has been so shattered and torn and trampled that it is unable to resist by any means the will and decision of the conquering Power.
Churchill	0	[Loud cheers.]
Churchill	0	For this purpose our whole nation must be organized [cheers] —must be socialized, if you like the word, must be organized and mobilized, and I think there must be asserted in some form or other—I do not attempt to prejudge that—but I think there must be asserted in some form or other by the Government, a reserve power to give the necessary control and organizing authority and to make sure that every one of every rank and condition, men and women as well, do, in their own way.
Churchill	0	their fair share.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Democratic principles enjoin it, social justice requires, national safety demands it, and I shall take back to London, with your authority, the message “Let the Government act according to its faith.” [Cheers.
Churchill	0	]Above all.
Churchill	0	let us be of good cheer.
Churchill	0	[Cheers, and a voice, “Shame the devil and to hell with the Huns.”] Let us be of good cheer.
Churchill	0	1 have told you how the Navy’s business has been discharged.
Churchill	0	You see for yourselves how your economic life and energy have been maintained without the slightest check, so that it is certain you can realize the full strength of this vast community.
Churchill	0	The valour of our soldiers has won general respect in all the Armies of Europe.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	The word of Britain is now taken as the symbol and the hall mark of international good faith.
Churchill	0	The loyalty of our Dominions and Colonies vindicates our civilization, and the hate of our enemies proves the effectiveness of our warfare.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	Yet I would advise you from time to time, when you are anxious or depressed, to dwell a little on the colour and light of the terrible war pictures now presented to the eye.
Churchill	0	See Australia and New Zealand smiting down in the last and finest crusade the combined barbarism of Prussia and of Turkey.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	General Louis Botha holding South Africa for the King.
Churchill	0	[Cheers.]
Churchill	0	See Canada defending to the death the last few miles of shattered Belgium.
Churchill	0	Look further, and, across the smoke and carnage of the immense battlefield, look forward to the vision of a united British Empire on the calm background of a liberated Europe.Then turn again to your task.
Churchill	0	Look forward, do not look backward.
Churchill	0	Gather afresh in heart and spirit all the energies of your being, bend anew together for a supreme effort.
Churchill	0	The times are harsh, need is dire, the agony of Europe is infinite, but the might of Britain hurled united into the conflict will be irresistible.
Churchill	0	We are the grand reserve of the Allied cause, and that grand reserve must now march forward as one man.
Churchill	0	[Loud and prolonged cheers.]
Churchill	0	From Churchill, Into Battle (London: Cassell, 1941), pages 83-91.Renewal copyright Winston S. Churchill © 2001.I avail myself with relief of the opportunity of speaking to the people of the United States.
Churchill	0	I do not know how long such liberties will be allowed.
Churchill	0	The stations of uncensored expression are closing down; the lights are going out; but there is still time for those to whom freedom and parliamentary government mean something, to consult together.
Churchill	0	Let me, then, speak in truth and earnestness while time remains.But all these backward speculations belong to history.
Churchill	0	It is no good using hard words among friends about the past, and reproaching one another for what cannot be recalled.
Churchill	0	It is the future, not the past, that demands our earnest and anxious thought.
Churchill	0	We must recognize that the Parliamentary democracies and liberal, peaceful forces have everywhere sustained a defeat which leaves them weaker, morally and physically, to cope with dangers which have vastly grown.
Churchill	0	But the cause of freedom has in it a recuperative power and virtue which can draw from misfortune new hope and new strength.
Churchill	0	If ever there was a time when men and women who cherish the ideals of the founders of the British and American Constitutions should take earnest counsel with one another, that time is now.All the world wishes for peace and security.
Churchill	0	Have we gained it by the sacrifice of the Czechoslovak Republic.
Churchill	0	Here was the model democratic State of Central Europe, a country where minorities were treated better than anywhere else.
Churchill	0	It has been deserted, destroyed and devoured.
Churchill	0	It is now being digested.
Churchill	0	The question which is of interest to a lot of ordinary people, common people, is whether this destruction of the Czechoslovak Republic will bring upon the world a blessing or a curse.We must all hope it will bring a blessing; that after we have averted our gaze for a while from the process of subjugation and liquidation, everyone will breathe more freely; that a load will be taken off our chests; we shall be able to say to ourselves: “Well, that’s out of the way, anyhow.
Churchill	0	Now let’s get on with our regular daily life.” But are these hopes well founded or are we merely making the best of what we had not the force and virtue to stop?
Churchill	0	That is the question that the English-speaking peoples in all their lands must ask themselves today.
Churchill	0	Is this the end, or is there more to come?There is another question which arises out of this.
Churchill	0	Can peace, goodwill, and confidence be built upon submission to wrong-doing backed by force?One may put this question in the largest form.
Churchill	0	Has any benefit or progress ever been achieved by the human race by submission to organised and calculated violence?
Churchill	0	As we look back over the long story of the nations we must see that, on the contrary, their glory has been founded upon the spirit of resistance to tyranny and injustice, especially when these evils seemed to be backed by heavier force.
Churchill	0	Since the dawn of the Christian era a certain way of life has slowly been shaping itself among the Western peoples, and certain standards of conduct and government have come to be esteemed.
Churchill	0	After many miseries and prolonged confusion, there arose into the broad light of day the conception of the right of the individual; his right to be consulted in the government of his country; his right to invoke the law even against the State itself.
Churchill	0	Independent Courts of Justice were created to affirm and inforce this hard-won custom.
Churchill	0	Thus was assured throughout the English-speaking world, and in France by the stern lessons of the Revolution, what Kipling called, “Leave to live by no man’s leave underneath the law.” Now in this resides all that makes existence precious to man, and all that confers honour and health upon the State.We are confronted with another theme.
Churchill	0	It is not a new theme; it leaps out upon us from the Dark Ages – racial persecution, religious intolerance, deprivation of free speech, the conception of the citizen as a mere soulless fraction of the State.
Churchill	0	To this has been added the cult of war.
Churchill	0	Children are to be taught in their earliest schooling the delights and profits of conquest and aggression.
Churchill	0	A whole mighty community has been drawn painfully, by severe privations, into a warlike frame.
Churchill	0	They are held in this condition, which they relish no more than we do, by a party organisation, several millions strong, who derive all kinds of profits, good and bad, from the upkeep of the regime.
Churchill	0	Like the Communists, the Nazis tolerate no opinion but their own.
Churchill	0	Like the Communists, they feed on hatred.
Churchill	0	Like the Communists, they must seek, from time to time, and always at shorter intervals, a new target, a new prize, a new victim.
Churchill	0	The Dictator, in all his pride, is held in the grip of his Party machine.
Churchill	0	He can go forward; he cannot go back.
Churchill	0	He must blood his hounds and show them sport, or else, like Actaeon of old, be devoured by them.
Churchill	0	All-strong without, he is all-weak within.
Churchill	0	As Byron wrote a hundred years ago: “These Pagod things of Sabre sway, with fronts of brass and feet of clay.”No one must, however, underrate the power and efficiency of a totalitarian state.
Churchill	0	Where the whole population of a great country, amiable, good-hearted, peace-loving people are gripped by the neck and by the hair by a Communist or a Nazi tyranny – for they are the same things spelt in different ways – the rulers for the time being can exercise a power for the purposes of war and external domination before which the ordinary free parliamentary societies are at a grievous practical disadvantage.
Churchill	0	We have to recognise this.
Churchill	0	And then, on top of all, comes this wonderful mastery of the air which our century has discovered, but of which, alas, mankind has so far shown itself unworthy.
Churchill	0	Here is this air power with its claim to torture and terrorise the women and children, the civil population of neighbouring countries.This combination of medieval passion, a party caucus, the weapons of modern science, and the blackmailing power of air-bombing, is the most monstrous menace to peace, order and fertile progress that has appeared in the world since the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century.The culminating question to which I have been leading is whether the world as we have known it – the great and hopeful world of before the war, the world of increasing hope and enjoyment for the common man, the world of honoured tradition and expanding science – should meet this menace by submission or by resistance.
Churchill	0	Let us see, then, whether the means of resistance remain to us today.
Churchill	0	We have sustained an immense disaster; the renown of France is dimmed.
Churchill	0	In spite of her brave, efficient army, her influence is profoundly diminished.
Churchill	0	No one has a right to say that Britain, for all her blundering, has broken her word – indeed, when it was too late, she was better than her word.
Churchill	0	Nevertheless, Europe lies at this moment abashed and distracted before the triumphant assertions of dictatorial power.
Churchill	0	In the Spanish Peninsula, a purely Spanish quarrel has been carried by the intervention, or shall I say the “non-intervention” (to quote the current Jargon) of Dictators into the region of a world cause.But it is not only in Europe that these oppressions prevail.
Churchill	0	China is being torn to pieces by a military clique in Japan; the poor, tormented Chinese people there are making a brave and stubborn defence.
Churchill	0	The ancient empire of Ethiopia has been overrun.
Churchill	0	The Ethiopians were taught to look to the sanctity of public law, to the tribunal of many nations gathered in majestic union.
Churchill	0	But all failed; they were deceived, and now they are winning back their right to live by beginning again from the bottom a struggle on primordial lines.
Churchill	0	Even in South America, the Nazi regime begins to undermine the fabric of Brazilian society.Far away, happily protected by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, you, the people of the United States, to whom I now have the chance to speak, are the spectators, and I may add the increasingly involved spectators of these tragedies and crimes.
Churchill	0	We are left in no doubt where American conviction and sympathies lie; but will you wait until British freedom and independence have succumbed, and then take up the cause when it is three-quarters ruined, yourselves alone?
Churchill	0	I hear that they are saying in the United States that because England and France have failed to do their duty therefore the American people can wash their hands of the whole business.
Churchill	0	This may be the passing mood of many people, but there is no sense in it.
Churchill	0	If things have got much worse, all the more must we try to cope with them.For, after all, survey the remaining forces of civilisation; they are overwhelming.
Churchill	0	If only they were united in a common conception of right and duty, there would be no war.
Churchill	0	On the contrary, the German people, industrious, faithful, valiant, but alas!
Churchill	0	lacking in the proper spirit of civic independence, liberated from their present nightmare, would take their honoured place in the vanguard of human society.
Churchill	0	Alexander the Great remarked that the people of Asia were slaves because they had not learned to pronounce the word “No.” Let that not be the epitaph of the English-speaking peoples or of Parliamentary democracy, or of France, or of the many surviving liberal States of Europe.There, in one single word, is the resolve which the forces of freedom and progress, of tolerance and good will, should take.
Churchill	0	It is not in the power of one nation, however formidably armed, still less is it in the power of a small group of men, violent, ruthless men, who have always to cast their eyes back over their shoulders, to cramp and fetter the forward march of human destiny.
Churchill	0	The preponderant world forces are upon our side; they have but to be combined to be obeyed.
Churchill	0	We must arm.
Churchill	0	Britain must arm.
Churchill	0	America must arm.
Churchill	0	If, through an earnest desire for peace, we have placed ourselves at a disadvantage, we must make up for it by redoubled exertions, and, if necessary, by fortitude in suffering.We shall, no doubt, arm.
Churchill	0	Britain, casting away the habits of centuries, will decree national service upon her citizens.
Churchill	0	The British people will stand erect, and will face whatever may be coming.But arms – instrumentalities, as President Wilson called them – are not sufficient by themselves.
Churchill	0	We must add to them the power of ideas.
Churchill	0	People say we ought not to allow ourselves to be drawn into a theoretical antagonism between Nazidom and democracy; but the antagonism is here now.
Churchill	0	It is this very conflict of spiritual and moral ideas which gives the free countries a great part of their strength.
Churchill	0	You see these dictators on their pedestals, surrounded by the bayonets of their soldiers and the truncheons of their police.
Churchill	0	On all sides they are guarded by masses of armed men, cannons, aeroplanes, fortifications, and the like – they boast and vaunt themselves before the world, yet in their hearts there is unspoken fear.
Churchill	0	They are afraid of words and thoughts; words spoken abroad, thoughts stirring at home – all the more powerful because forbidden – terrify them.
Churchill	0	A little mouse of thought appears in the room, and even the mightiest potentates are thrown into panic.
Churchill	0	They make frantic efforts to bar our thoughts and words; they are afraid of the workings of the human mind.
Churchill	0	Cannons, airplanes, they can manufacture in large quantities; but how are they to quell the natural promptings of human nature, which after all these centuries of trial and progress has inherited a whole armoury of potent and indestructible knowledge?Dictatorship – the fetish worship of one man – is a passing phase.
Churchill	0	A state of society where men may not speak their minds, where children denounce their parents to the police, where a business man or small shopkeeper ruins his competitor by telling tales about his private opinions; such a state of society cannot long endure if brought into contact with the healthy outside world.
Churchill	0	The light of civilised progress with its tolerances and co-operation, with its dignities and joys, has often in the past been blotted out.
Churchill	0	But I hold the belief that we have now at last got far enough ahead of barbarism to control it, and to avert it, if only we realise what is afoot and make up our minds in time.
Churchill	0	We shall do it in the end.
Churchill	0	But how much harder our toil for every day’s delay!Is this a call to war?
Churchill	0	Does anyone pretend that preparation for resistance to aggression is unleashing war?
Churchill	0	I declare it to be the sole guarantee of peace.
Churchill	0	We need the swift gathering of forces to confront not only military but moral aggression; the resolute and sober acceptance of their duty by the English-speaking peoples and by all the nations, great and small, who wish to walk with them.
Churchill	0	Their faithful and zealous comradeship would almost between night and morning clear the path of progress and banish from all our lives the fear which already darkens the sunlight to hundreds of millions of men.
Churchill	0	Nevelle Chamberlain returns from MunichIf I do not begin this afternoon by paying the usual, and indeed almost invariable, tributes to the Prime Minister for his handling of this crisis, it is certainly not from any lack of personal regard.
Churchill	0	We have always, over a great many years, had very pleasant relations, and I have deeply understood from personal experiences of my own in a similar crisis the stress and strain he has had to bear; but I am sure it is much better to say exactly what we think about public affairs, and this is certainly not the time when it is worth anyone’s while to court political popularity.We had a shining example of firmness of character from the late First Lord of the Admiralty two days ago.
Churchill	0	He showed that firmness of character which is utterly unmoved by currents of opinion, however swift and violent they may be.
Churchill	0	My hon.
Churchill	0	Friend the Member for South-West Hull (Mr. Law), to whose compulsive speech the House listened on Monday, was quite right in reminding us that the Prime Minister has himself throughout his conduct of these matters shown a robust indifference to cheers or boos and to the alternations of criticism or applause.
Churchill	0	If that be so, such qualities and elevation of mind should make it possible for the most severe expressions of honest opinion to be interchanged in this House without rupturing personal relations, and for all points of view to receive the fullest possible expression.Having thus fortified myself by the example of others, I will proceed to emulate them.
Churchill	0	I will, therefore, begin by saying the most unpopular and most unwelcome thing.
Churchill	0	I will begin by saying what everybody would like to ignore or forget but which must nevertheless be stated, namely, that we have sustained a total and unmitigated defeat, and that France has suffered even more than we have.The utmost my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend the Prime Minister has been able to secure by all his immense exertions, by all the great efforts and mobilisation which took place in this country, and by all the anguish and strain through which we have passed in this country, the utmost he has been able to gain for Czechoslovakia in the matters which were in dispute has been that the German dictator, instead of snatching the victuals from the table, has been content to have them served to him course by course.The Chancellor of the Exchequer [Sir John Simon] said it was the first time Herr Hitler had been made to retract – I think that was the word – in any degree.
Churchill	0	We really must not waste time after all this long Debate upon the difference between the positions reached at Berchtesgaden, at Godesberg and at Munich.
Churchill	0	They can be very simply epitomised, if the House will permit me to vary the metaphor.
Churchill	0	£1 was demanded at the pistol’s point.
Churchill	0	When it was given, £2 were demanded at the pistol’s point.
Churchill	0	Finally, the dictator consented to take £1 17s.
Churchill	0	6d.
Churchill	0	and the rest in promises of goodwill for the future.Now I come to the point, which was mentioned to me just now from some quarters of the House, about the saving of peace.
Churchill	0	No one has been a more resolute and uncompromising struggler for peace than the Prime Minister.
Churchill	0	Everyone knows that.
Churchill	0	Never has there been such instance and undaunted determination to maintain and secure peace.
Churchill	0	That is quite true.
Churchill	0	Nevertheless, I am not quite clear why there was so much danger of Great Britain or France being involved in a war with Germany at this juncture if, in fact, they were ready all along to sacrifice Czechoslovakia.The terms which the Prime Minister brought back with him could easily have been agreed, I believe, through the ordinary diplomatic channels at any time during the summer.
Churchill	0	And I will say this, that I believe the Czechs, left to themselves and told they were going to get no help from the Western Powers, would have been able to make better terms than they have got after all this tremendous perturbation; they could hardly have had worse.There never can be any absolute certainty that there will be a fight if one side is determined that it will give way completely.
Churchill	0	When one reads the Munich terms, when one sees what is happening in Czechoslovakia from hour to hour, when one is sure, I will not say of Parliamentary approval but of Parliamentary acquiescence, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer makes a speech which at any rate tries to put in a very powerful and persuasive manner the fact that, after all, it was inevitable and indeed righteous: when we say all this, and everyone on this side of the House, including many members of the Conservative Party who are vigilant and careful guardians of the national interest, is quite clear that nothing vitally affecting us was at stake, it seems to me that one must ask, What was all the trouble and fuss about?The resolve was taken by the British and the French Governments.
Churchill	0	Let me say that it is very important to realise that it is by no means a question which the British Government only have had to decide.
Churchill	0	I very much admire the manner in which, in the House, all references of a recriminatory nature have been repressed.
Churchill	0	But it must be realised that this resolve did not emanate particularly from one or other of the Governments but was a resolve for which both must share in common the responsibility.When this resolve was taken and the course was followed – you may say it was wise or unwise, prudent or short-sighted – once it had been decided not to make the defence of Czechoslovakia a matter of war, then there was really no reason, if the matter had been handled during the summer in the ordinary way, to call into being all this formidable apparatus of crisis.
Churchill	0	I think that point should be considered.We are asked to vote for this Motion which has been put upon the Paper, and it is certainly a Motion couched in very uncontroversial terms, as, indeed, is the Amendment moved from the Opposition side.
Churchill	0	I cannot myself express my agreement with the steps which have been taken, and as the Chancellor of the Exchequer has put his side of the case with so much ability I will attempt, if I may be permitted, to put the case from a different angle.
Churchill	0	I have always held the view that the maintenance of peace depends upon the accumulation of deterrents against the aggressor, coupled with a sincere effort to redress grievances.
Churchill	0	Herr Hitler’s victory, like so many of the famous struggles that have governed the fate of the world, was won upon the narrowest of margins.After the seizure of Austria in March we faced this problem in our Debates.
Churchill	0	I ventured to appeal to the Government to go a little further than the Prime Minister went, and to give a pledge that in conjunction with France and other Powers they would guarantee the security of Czechoslovakia while the Sudeten-Deutsch question was being examined either by a League of Nations Commission or some other impartial body, and I still believe that if that course had been followed events would not have fallen into this disastrous state.
Churchill	0	I agree very much with my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend the Member for Sparkbrook (Mr. Amery) when he said on that occasion – “Do one thing or the other; either say you will disinterest yourself in the matter altogether or take the step of giving a guarantee which will have the greatest chance of securing protection for that country.”France and Great Britain together, especially if they had maintained a close contact with Russia, which certainly was not done, would have been able in those days in the summer, when they had the prestige, to influence many of the smaller states of Europe; and I believe they could have determined the attitude of Poland.
Churchill	0	Such a combination, prepared at a time when the German dictator was not deeply and irrevocably committed to his new adventure, would, I believe, have given strength to all those forces in Germany which resisted this departure, this new design.They were varying forces; – those of a military character which declared that Germany was not ready to undertake a world war, and all that mass of moderate opinion and popular opinion which dreaded war, and some elements of which still have some influence upon the Government.
Churchill	0	Such action would have given strength to all that intense desire for peace which the helpless German masses share with their British and French fellow men, and which, as we have been reminded, found a passionate and rarely permitted vent in the joyous manifestations with which the Prime Minister was acclaimed in Munich.All these forces, added to the other deterrents which combinations of Powers, great and small, ready to stand firm upon the front of law and for the ordered remedy of grievances, would have formed, might well have been effective.
Churchill	0	Between submission and immediate war there was this third alternative, which gave a hope not only of peace but of justice.
Churchill	0	It is quite true that such a policy in order to succeed demanded that Britain should declare straight out and a long time beforehand that she would, with others, join to defend Czechoslovakia against an unprovoked aggression.
Churchill	0	His Majesty’s Government refused to give that guarantee when it would have saved the situation, yet in the end they gave it when it was too late, and now, for the future, they renew it when they have not the slightest power to make it good.All is over.
Churchill	0	Silent, mournful, abandoned, broken, Czechoslovakia recedes into the darkness.
Churchill	0	She has suffered in every respect by her association with the Western democracies and with the League of Nations, of which she has always been an obedient servant.
Churchill	0	She has suffered in particular from her association with France, under whose guidance and policy she has been actuated for so long.
Churchill	0	The very measures taken by His Majesty’s Government in the Anglo-French Agreement to give her the best chance possible, namely, the 50 per cent, clean cut in certain districts instead of a plebiscite, have turned to her detriment, because there is to be a plebiscite too in wide areas, and those other Powers who had claims have also come down upon the helpless victim.Those municipal elections upon whose voting the basis is taken for the 50 per cent.
Churchill	0	cut were held on issues which had nothing to do with joining Germany.
Churchill	0	When I saw Herr Henlein over here he assured me that was not the desire of his people.
Churchill	0	Positive statements were made that it was only a question of home rule, of having a position of their own in the Czechoslovakian State.
Churchill	0	No one has a right to say that the plebiscite which is to be taken in areas under Saar conditions, and the clean-cut of the 50 per cent.
Churchill	0	areas – that those two operations together amount in the slightest degree to a verdict of self-determination.
Churchill	0	It is a fraud and a farce to invoke that name.We in this country, as in other Liberal and democratic countries, have a perfect right to exalt the principle of self-determination, but it comes ill out of the mouths of those in totalitarian states who deny even the smallest element of toleration to every section and creed within their bounds.
Churchill	0	But, however you put it, this particular block of land, this mass of human beings to be handed over, has never expressed the desire to go into the Nazi rule.
Churchill	0	I do not believe that even now, if their opinion could be asked, they would exercise such an opinion.What is the remaining position of Czechoslovakia?
Churchill	0	Not only are they politically mutilated, but, economically and financially, they are in complete confusion.
Churchill	0	Their banking, their railway arrangements, are severed and broken, their industries are curtailed, and the movement of their population is most cruel.
Churchill	0	The Sudeten miners, who are all Czechs and whose families have lived in that area for centuries, must now flee into an area where there are hardly any mines left for them to work.
Churchill	0	It is a tragedy which has occurred.
Churchill	0	There must always be the most profound regret and a sense of vexation in British hearts at the treatment and the misfortune which have overcome the Czechoslovakian Republic.They have not ended here.
Churchill	0	At any moment there may be a hitch in the programme.
Churchill	0	At any moment there may be an order for Herr Goebbels to start again his propaganda of calumny and lies; at any moment an incident may be provoked, and now that the fortress line is turned away what is there to stop the will of the conqueror?
Churchill	0	Obviously, we are not in a position to give them the slightest help at the present time, except what everyone is glad to know has been done, the financial aid which the Government have promptly produced.I venture to think that in future the Czechoslovak State cannot be maintained as an independent entity.
Churchill	0	I think you will find that in a period of time which may be measured by years, but may be measured only by months, Czechoslovakia will be engulfed in the Nazi regime.
Churchill	0	Perhaps they may join it in despair or in revenge.
Churchill	0	At any rate, that story is over and told.
Churchill	0	But we cannot consider the abandonment and ruin of Czechoslovakia in the light only of what happened only last month.
Churchill	0	It is the most grievous consequence of what we have done and of what we have left undone in the last five years – five years of futile good intentions, five years of eager search for the line of least resistance, five years of uninterrupted retreat of British power, five years of neglect of our air defences.Those are the features which I stand here to expose and which marked an improvident stewardship for which Great Britain and France have dearly to pay.
Churchill	0	We have been reduced in those five years from a position of security so overwhelming and so unchallengeable that we never cared to think about it.
Churchill	0	We have been reduced from a position where the very word “war” was considered one which could be used only by persons qualifying for a lunatic asylum.
Churchill	0	We have been reduced from a position of safety and power – power to do good, power to be generous to a beaten foe, power to make terms with Germany, power to give her proper redress for her grievances, power to stop her arming if we chose, power to take any step in strength or mercy or justice which we thought right – reduced in five years from a position safe and unchallenged to where we stand now.When I think of the fair hopes of a long peace which still lay before Europe at the beginning of 1933 when Herr Hitler first obtained power, and of all the opportunities of arresting the growth of the Nazi power which have been thrown away, when I think of the immense combinations and resources which have been neglected or squandered, I cannot believe that a parallel exists in the whole course of history.So far as this country is concerned the responsibility must rest with those who have had the undisputed control of our political affairs.
Churchill	0	They neither prevented Germany from rearming, nor did they rearm themselves in time.
Churchill	0	They quarrelled with Italy without saving Ethiopia.
Churchill	0	The exploited and discredited the vast institution of the League of Nations and they neglected to make alliances and combinations which might have repaired previous errors, and thus they left us in the hour of trial without adequate national defence or effective international security.In my holiday I thought it was a chance to study the reign of King Ethelred the Unready.
Churchill	0	The House will remember that that was a period of great misfortune, in which, from the strong position which we had gained under the descendants of King Alfred, we fell very swiftly into chaos.
Churchill	0	It was the period of Danegeld and of foreign pressure.
Churchill	0	I must say that the rugged words of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written a thousand years ago, seem to me apposite, at least as apposite as those quotations from Shakespeare with which we have been regaled by the last speaker from the Opposition Bench.
Churchill	0	Here is what the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle said, and I think the words apply very much to our treatment of Germany and our relations with her.“All these calamities fell upon us because of evil counsel, because tribute was not offered to them at the right time nor yet were they resisted; but when they had done the most evil, then was peace made with them.”That is the wisdom of the past, for all wisdom is not new wisdom.I have ventured to express those views in justifying myself for not being able to support the Motion which is moved to-night, but I recognise that this great matter of Czechoslovakia, and of British and French duty there, has passed into history.
Churchill	0	New developments may come along, but we are not here to decide whether any of those steps should be taken or not.
Churchill	0	They have been taken.
Churchill	0	They have been taken by those who had a right to take them because they bore the highest executive responsibility under the Crown.Whatever we may think of it, we must regard those steps as belonging to the category of affairs which are settled beyond recall.
Churchill	0	The past is no more, and one can only draw comfort if one feels that one has done one’s best to advise rightly and wisely and in good time.
Churchill	0	I, therefore, turn to the future, and to our situation as it is to-day.
Churchill	0	Here, again, I am sure I shall have to say something which will not be at all welcome.We are in the presence of a disaster of the first magnitude which has befallen Great Britain and France.
Churchill	0	Do not let us blind ourselves to that.
Churchill	0	It must now be accepted that all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will make the best terms they can with the triumphant Nazi power.
Churchill	0	The system of alliances in Central Europe upon which France has relied for her safety has been swept away, and I can see no means by which it can be reconstituted.
Churchill	0	The road down the Danube Valley to the Black Sea, the road which leads as far as Turkey, has been opened.In fact, if not in form, it seems to me that all those countries of Middle Europe, all those Danubian countries, will, one after another, be drawn into this vast system of power politics – not only power military politics but power economic politics – radiating from Berlin, and I believe this can be achieved quite smoothly and swiftly and will not necessarily entail the firing of a single shot.
Churchill	0	If you wish to survey the havoc of the foreign policy of Britain and France, look at what is happening and is recorded each day in the columns of The Times.
Churchill	0	Why, I read this morning about Yugoslavia – and I know something about the details of that country –“The effects of the crisis for Yugoslavia can immediately be traced.
Churchill	0	Since the elections of 1935, which followed soon after the murder of King Alexander, the Serb and Croat Opposition to the Government of Dr. Stoyadinovitch have been conducting their entire campaign for the next elections under the slogan: ‘Back to France,   England, and the Little Entente; back to democracy.’ The events of the past fortnight have so triumphantly vindicated Dr. Stoyadinovitch’s policy….” – his is a policy of close association with Germany – “that the Opposition has collapsed practically overnight; the new elections, the date of which was in doubt, are now likely to be held very soon and can result only in an overwhelming victory for Dr. Stoyadinovitch’s Government.”Here was a country which, three months ago, would have stood in the line with other countries to arrest what has occurred.Again, what happened in Warsaw?
Churchill	0	The British and French Ambassadors visited the Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, or sought to visit him, in order to ask for some mitigation in the harsh measures being pursued against Czechoslovakia about Teschen.
Churchill	0	The door was shut in their faces, The French Ambassador was not even granted an audience and the British Ambassador was given a most curt reply by a political director.
Churchill	0	The whole matter is described in the Polish Press as a political indiscretion committed by those two powers, and we are to-day reading of the success of Colonel Beck’s blow.
Churchill	0	I am not forgetting, I must say, that it is less than twenty years since British and French bayonets rescued Poland from the bondage of a century and a half.
Churchill	0	I think it is indeed a sorry episode in the history of that country, for whose freedom and rights so many of us have had warm and long sympathy.Those illustrations are typical.
Churchill	0	You will see, day after day, week after week, entire alienation of those regions.
Churchill	0	Many of those countries, in fear of the rise of the Nazi power, have already got politicians, Ministers, Governments, who were pro-German, but there was always an enormous popular movement in Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia which looked to the Western democracies and loathed the idea of having this arbitrary rule of the totalitarian system thrust upon them, and hoped that a stand would be made.
Churchill	0	All that has gone by the board.
Churchill	0	We are talking about countries which are a long way off.But what will be the position, I want to know, of France and England this year and the year afterwards?
Churchill	0	What will be the position of that Western front of which we are in full authority the guarantors?
Churchill	0	The German army at the present time is more numerous than that of France, though not nearly so matured or perfected.
Churchill	0	Next year it will grow much larger, and its maturity will be more complete.
Churchill	0	Relieved from all anxiety in the East, and having secured resources which will greatly diminish, if not entirely remove, the deterrent of a naval blockade, the rulers of Nazi Germany will have a free choice open to them as to what direction they will turn their eyes.
Churchill	0	If the Nazi dictator should choose to look westward, as he may, bitterly will France and England regret the loss of that fine army of ancient Bohemia which was estimated last week to require not fewer than 30 German divisions for its destruction.Can we blind ourselves to the great change which has taken place in the military situation, and to the dangers we have to meet?
Churchill	0	We are in process, I believe, of adding in four years, four battalions to the British Army.
Churchill	0	No fewer than two have already been completed.
Churchill	0	Here are at least 30 divisions which must now be taken into consideration upon the French front, besides the 12 that were captured when Austria was engulfed.Many people, no doubt, honestly believe that they are only giving away the interests of Czechoslovakia, whereas I fear we shall find that we have deeply compromised, and perhaps fatally endangered, the safety and even the independence of Great Britain and France.
Churchill	0	This is not merely a question of giving up the German colonies, as I am sure we shall be asked to do.
Churchill	0	Nor is it a question only of losing influence in Europe.
Churchill	0	It goes far deeper than that.
Churchill	0	You have to consider the character of the Nazi movement and the rule which it implies.The Prime Minister desires to see cordial relations between this country and Germany.
Churchill	0	There is no difficulty at all in having cordial relations between the peoples.
Churchill	0	Our hearts go out to them.
Churchill	0	But they have no power.
Churchill	0	But never will you have friendship with the present German Government.
Churchill	0	You must have diplomatic and correct relations, but there can never be friendship between the British democracy and the Nazi power, that power which spurns Christian ethics, which cheers its onward course by a barbarous paganism, which vaunts the spirit of aggression and conquest, which derives strength and perverted pleasure from persecution, and uses, as we have seen, with pitiless brutality the threat of murderous force.
Churchill	0	That power cannot ever be the trusted friend of the British democracy.What I find unendurable is the sense of our country falling into the power, into the orbit and influence of Nazi Germany, and of our existence becoming dependent upon their good will or pleasure.
Churchill	0	It is to prevent that that I have tried my best to urge the maintenance of every bulwark of defence – first, the timely creation of an Air Force superior to anything within striking distance of our shores; secondly, the gathering together of the collective strength of many nations; and thirdly, the making of alliances and military conventions, all within the Covenant, in order to gather together forces at any rate to restrain the onward movement of this power.
Churchill	0	It has all been in vain.
Churchill	0	Every position has been successively undermined and abandoned on specious and plausible excuses.We do not want to be led upon the high road to becoming a satellite of the German Nazi system of European domination.
Churchill	0	In a very few years, perhaps in a very few months, we shall be confronted with demands with which we shall no doubt be invited to comply.
Churchill	0	Those demands may affect the surrender of territory or the surrender of liberty.
Churchill	0	I foresee and foretell that the policy of submission will carry with it restrictions upon the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, on public platforms, and discussions in the Press, for it will be said – indeed, I hear it said sometimes now – that we cannot allow the Nazi system of dictatorship to be criticised by ordinary, common English politicians.
Churchill	0	Then, with a Press under control, in part direct but more potently indirect, with every organ of public opinion doped and chloroformed into acquiescence, we shall be conducted along further stages of our journey.It is a small matter to introduce into such a Debate as this, but during the week I heard something of the talk of Tadpole and Taper.
Churchill	0	They were very keen upon having a general election, a sort of, if I may say so, inverted khaki election.
Churchill	0	I wish the Prime Minister had heard the speech of my hon.
Churchill	0	and gallant friend the Member for the Abbey Division of Westminster (Sir Sidney Herbert) last night.
Churchill	0	I know that no one is more patient and regular in his attendance than the Prime Minister, and it is marvellous how he is able to sit through so much of our Debates, but it happened that by bad luck he was not here at that moment.
Churchill	0	I am sure, however, that if he had heard my hon.
Churchill	0	and gallant Friend’s speech he would have felt very much annoyed that such a rumour could even have been circulated.I cannot believe that the Prime Minister, or any Prime Minister, possessed of a large working majority, would be capable of such an act of historic, constitutional indecency.
Churchill	0	I think too highly of him.
Churchill	0	Of course, if I have misjudged him on the right side, and there is a dissolution on the Munich Agreement, on Anglo-Nazi friendship, of the state of our defences and so forth, everyone will have to fight according to his convictions, and only a prophet could forecast the ultimate result; but, whatever the result, few things could be more fatal to our remaining chances of survival as a great Power than that this country should be torn in twain upon this deadly issue, of foreign policy at a moment when, whoever the Ministers may be, united effort can alone make us safe.I have been casting about to see how measures can be taken to protect us from this advance of the Nazi power, and to secure those forms of life which are so dear to us.
Churchill	0	What is the sole method that is open?
Churchill	0	The sole method that is open is for us to regain our old island independence by acquiring that supremacy in the air which we were promised, that security in our air defences which we were assured we had, and thus to make ourselves an island once again.
Churchill	0	That, in all this grim outlook, shines out as the overwhelming fact.An effort at rearmament the like of which has not been seen ought to be made forthwith, and all the resources of this country and all its united strength should be bent to that task.
Churchill	0	I was very glad to see that Lord Baldwin yesterday in the House of Lords said that he would mobilise industry to-morrow.
Churchill	0	But I think it would have been much better if Lord Baldwin had said that two and a half years ago, when everyone demanded a Ministry of Supply.
Churchill	0	I will venture to say to hon.
Churchill	0	Gentlemen sitting here behind the Government Bench, hon.
Churchill	0	Friends of mine, whom I thank for the patience with which they have listened to what I have to say, that they have some responsibility for all this too, because, if they had given one tithe of the cheers they have lavished upon this transaction of Czechoslovakia to the small band of Members, who were endeavouring to get timely rearmament set in motion, we should not now be in the position in which we are.
Churchill	0	Hon.
Churchill	0	Gentlemen opposite, and hon.
Churchill	0	Members on the Liberal benches, are not entitled to throw these stones.
Churchill	0	I remember for two years having to face, not only the Government’s depreciation, but their stern disapproval.
Churchill	0	Lord Baldwin has now given the signal, tardy though it may be; let us at least obey it.After all, there are no secrets now about what happened in the air and in the mobilisation of our anti-aircraft defences.
Churchill	0	These matters have been, as my hon.
Churchill	0	and gallant Friend the Member for the Abbey Division said, seen by thousands of people.
Churchill	0	They can form their own opinions of the character of the statements which have been persistently made to us by Ministers on this subject.
Churchill	0	Who pretends now that there is air parity with Germany?
Churchill	0	Who pretends now that our anti-aircraft defences were adequately manned or armed?We know that the German General Staff are well informed upon these subjects, but the House of Commons has hitherto not taken seriously its duty of requiring to assure itself on these matters.
Churchill	0	The Home Secretary said the other night that he would welcome investigation.
Churchill	0	Many things have been done which reflect the greatest credit upon the administration.
Churchill	0	But the vital matters are what we want to know about.
Churchill	0	I have asked again and again during these three years for a secret Session where these matters could be thrashed out, or for an investigation by a Select Committee of the House, or for some other method.
Churchill	0	I ask now that, when we meet again in the autumn, that should be a matter on which the Government should take the House into its confidence, because we have a right to know where we stand and what measures are being taken to secure our position.I do not grudge our loyal, brave people, who were ready to do their duty no matter what the cost, who never flinched under the strain of last week – I do not grudge them the natural, spontaneous outburst of joy and relief when they learned that the hard ordeal would no longer be required of them at the moment; but they should know the truth.
Churchill	0	They should know that there has been gross neglect and deficiency in our defences; they should know that we have sustained a defeat without a war, the consequences of which will travel far with us along our road; they should know that we have passed an awful milestone in our history, when the whole equilibrium of Europe has been deranged, and that the terrible words have for the time being been pronounced against the Western democracies:“Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting.”And do not suppose that this is the end.
Churchill	0	This is only the beginning of the reckoning.
Churchill	0	This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigour, we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.
Churchill	0	The final two majestic paragraphs of this great speech on the failure of Britain to respond to the Nazi menace, were included with the rest of the speech Churchill’s collection of speeches, Arms and the Covenant (While England Slept in USA), but not in the Complete Speeches.
Churchill	0	Their editor, the late Sir Robert Rhodes James, explained that his text largely was taken directly from Hansard.
Churchill	0	This suggests a degree of editing by Churchill or his editor and son in the book.
Churchill	0	He was certainly an indefatigable reviser.
Churchill	0	If he did so in this case, he revised well.The Prime Minister, in what I think it is not presumptuous for me to describe as a very fine speech, set before us the object which is in all our minds—namely, how to prevent war.
Churchill	0	A country like ours, possessed of immense territory and wealth, whose defences have been neglected, cannot avoid war by dilating upon its horrors, or even by a continuous display of pacific qualities, or by ignoring the fate of the victims of aggression elsewhere.
Churchill	0	War will be avoided, in present circumstances, only by the accumulation of deterrents against the aggressor.
Churchill	0	If our defences are weak, we must seek allies; and, of course, if we seek allies, alliances involve commitments.
Churchill	0	But the increase of commitments may be justified if it is followed by a still greater increase of deterrents against aggression.I was very glad to hear the Prime Minister reaffirm in such direct terms our arrangements for mutual defence with the French Republic.
Churchill	0	Evidently they amount to a defensive alliance.
Churchill	0	Why not say so?
Churchill	0	Why not make it effective by a military convention of the most detailed character?
Churchill	0	Are we, once again, to have all the disadvantages of an alliance without its advantages, and to have commitments without full security?
Churchill	0	Great Britain and France have to stand together for mutual protection.
Churchill	0	Why should not the conditions be worked out precisely and the broad facts made public?
Churchill	0	Everyone knows, for instance, that our Air Force is tripled in deterrent effectiveness if it operates from French bases, and, as I pointed out in the House three weeks ago, the fact that an attack upon this country would bring the attacker into conflict with the French Army is another great security to us here.
Churchill	0	We are obliged in return to go to the aid of France, and hitherto we have always been better than our word.Here, then, is the great security for the two countries.
Churchill	0	Do not conceal it.
Churchill	0	Proclaim it, implement it, work it out in thorough detail.
Churchill	0	Treat the defensive problems of the two countries as if they were one.
Churchill	0	Then you will have a real deterrent against unprovoked aggression, and if the deterrent fails to deter, you will have a highly organized method of coping with the aggressor.
Churchill	0	The present rulers of Germany will hesitate long before they attack the British Empire and the French Republic if those are woven together for defence purposes into one very powerful unit.
Churchill	0	Having gone so far, there is no safe halting-place short of an open defensive alliance with France, not with loose obligations, but with defined obligations on both sides and complete inter-staff arrangements.
Churchill	0	Even an isolationist would, I think, go so far as to say, “If we have to mix ourselves up with the Continent, let us, at any rate, get the maximum of safety from our commitments.”**The Government acted in this sense and a month later invited M. Daladier and M. Bonnet to London to discuss methods of concerting the defensive arrangements of the two countries.Then we come to the case of Czechoslovakia.
Churchill	0	There has been a lot of talk about giving a guarantee, but I should be sorry if the grave issue now open in Europe were to turn solely on that point, cardinal though it be.
Churchill	0	Far wider decisions are called for; far larger interests are at stake.
Churchill	0	I listened with the utmost attention to all that the Prime Minister said about our relations to Czechoslovakia, and it seems to me that he has gone a long way in making a commitment.
Churchill	0	First, I was very glad to hear him reaffirm his adherence and that of the Government to the obligations of the Covenant of the League.
Churchill	0	Under the Covenant of the League we are not obliged to go to war for Czechoslovakia.
Churchill	0	But we are obliged not to be neutral, in the sense of being indifferent, if Czechoslovakia is the victim of unprovoked aggression.
Churchill	0	The Prime Minister seemed to me to go farther than those mere obligations of the League, and to indicate how very real was the interest which we took in affairs in that part of the world.
Churchill	0	Lord Halifax, speaking in another place, used language which is particularly important coming from the head of the Foreign Office.
Churchill	0	He said he had asked Field-Marshal Göring to repeat to him the assurances which he had given to the Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia, and that this had been done by the German Government; and then Lord Halifax said: “By those assurances, solemnly given and more than once repeated, we naturally expect the German Government to abide, and if indeed they desire to see European peace maintained, as I earnestly hope they do, there is no quarter in Europe in which it is more vital that undertakings should be scrupulously respected.”We not only have, therefore, the general obligations of the Covenant of the League, but we have this particular reference to special assurances given and received and noted.
Churchill	0	There is a third aspect.
Churchill	0	We have our agreement, which I have described, and of which the Prime Minister has reminded us, with France, and if France is attacked by Germany for going to the rescue of Czechoslovakia, no one can say that we shall not be involved—not legally, not as a matter of bond, but by the force of events.
Churchill	0	The Prime Minister used language which undoubtedly had the effect of making it perfectly plain that the course of war once started could not be limited, that no one could tell what would happen, that other countries would be drawn in, and he mentioned especially France and Great Britain as two countries which might be involved.Taking all these points together, I cannot doubt that we have considerable commitments, and, personally, I am very thankful for any words that have been used which sustain that point of view.
Churchill	0	But this seems to be another case, if I may say so, of making very considerable commitments without gaining the full proportion of deterrent value.
Churchill	0	We are not taking the fullest steps in our power to stop the event occurring, and yet we are liable to suffer from it if it occurs.
Churchill	0	We are liable not only to be drawn in, but to be drawn in, perhaps, late in the day, and very likely in unfavourable circumstances.
Churchill	0	It is really for consideration whether, having gone so far, the bolder course might not be the safer.
Churchill	0	All attempts to bridge a twelve-foot stream by an eight-foot plank are doomed to failure, and the plank is lost.
Churchill	0	It is a concession, no doubt, to bring forward a nine-foot plank, but again that may be lost.
Churchill	0	The great point in view is to achieve the object, and to produce the effect of an adequate deterrent.The question does not turn upon an automatic permanent pledge.
Churchill	0	What I should be inclined to ask if these matters could be at any time reconsidered is not that a permanent or automatic pledge should be given, but that now, on this present occasion, in the circumstances which surround us at the moment, with the rape of Austria before our eyes, Great Britain should say, “If the Germans march in upon this State of Czechoslovakia without even waiting for an impartial examination, perhaps by a commission of the League of Nations, or some other body, into the position of the Sudeten Deutsch and the remedies offered for their grievances—if in those circumstances an act of violent aggression were committed upon that country, then we should feel, on this occasion, and in this emergency, bound to act with France in resisting it.”Such a declaration, although limited to this particular emergency, although limited until a tribunal has examined the position and until the negotiations now proceeding have reached their conclusion—such an assurance would, I believe, do a great deal to stabilize the position in Europe, and I cannot see that it would very seriously add to our risks.I must say that I myself have not felt during this crisis that there is an immediate danger of a major land war breaking out over Czechoslovakia.
Churchill	0	I know it is very rash to make such a statement, but when there is so much natural, but misdirected, alarm in the country, now on one point and now on another, one must run some risks in stating one’s honest opinion.
Churchill	0	At any rate, that is the assumption on which I base my argument this afternoon, and I will give my reasons to the House.
Churchill	0	The first reason is that, in the opinion of many good judges, Germany is not ready this year for such an ordeal as a major land war.
Churchill	0	The second reason carries more conviction to me, because obviously the first is based upon facts which one cannot measure and secrets which one cannot probe.
Churchill	0	It is that I cannot see that it would be to the interest of the rulers of Germany to provoke such a war.Are they not getting all they want without it?
Churchill	0	Are they not achieving a long succession of most important objectives without firing a single shot?
Churchill	0	Is there any limit to the economic and political pressure which, without actually using military force, Germany will be able to bring to bear upon this unhappy State?
Churchill	0	She can be convulsed politically, she can be strangled economically, she is practically surrounded by superior forces, and, unless something is done to mitigate the pressure of circumstances, she will be forced to make continuous surrenders, far beyond the bounds of what any impartial tribunal would consider just or right, until finally her sovereignty, her independence, her integrity, have been destroyed.
Churchill	0	Why, then, should the rulers of Germany strike a military blow?
Churchill	0	Why should they incur the risk of a major war?Moreover, I think it is to be considered that there are other, even more tempting lines of advance open to Germany’s ambitions.
Churchill	0	A serious disturbance among the Hungarian population in the Rumanian province of Transylvania might offer a pretext for the entry of German troops, at a Hungarian invitation or without it.
Churchill	0	Then all the possibilities of the oil and food of Rumania would be open.
Churchill	0	Here, again, force may be avoided and virtual annexation may be veiled in the guise of a compulsory alliance.
Churchill	0	In the meantime the control of Vienna enables the economic fortunes of all the States of the Danubian Basin to be manipulated, exploited and controlled so as to favour German designs, and for the benefit of German finance, trade and arms.
Churchill	0	Why, then, should Germany go to the one place where she would encounter the veto of France, and of Russia, which has also made definite assurances?
Churchill	0	I do not think the Government would have run very much risk if they had added the full force of Great Britain to the French declaration about Czechoslovakia.
Churchill	0	They would not greatly have increased their commitments and they would have made assurance double sure.But the story of this year is not ended at Czechoslovakia.
Churchill	0	It is not ended this month.
Churchill	0	The might behind the German Dictator increases daily.
Churchill	0	His appetite may grow with eating.
Churchill	0	The forces of law and freedom have for a long time known nothing but rebuffs, failures and humiliations.
Churchill	0	Their influence would be immensely increased by any signs of concerted action and initiative and combination.The fact that Britain and France combined together at such a moment in such a cause would give them the strength and authority that they need in order to convince wavering States that they might find a good company of determined people to whom they might join themselves upon the basis of the Covenant and in accordance with its principles.
Churchill	0	On the morrow of such a proof of unity as could be given between Great Britain and France we might be able to make such an arrangement, or begin to make it, for the effective fulfilment of the Covenant.
Churchill	0	We might have a group of Powers, as it were Mandatories of the League, who would be the guardians of civilization, and once this was set up strong and real it would liberate us, at least over a long period, from the torments of uncertainty and anxiety which we now have to endure.
Churchill	0	Joint action on this occasion would make easier and safer the problem of dealing with the next occasion.
Churchill	0	If successful, it would certainly pave the way to more effective joint action in the enforcement of the non-intervention policy in Spain.
Churchill	0	Nations that have joined together to meet one particular emergency may well find, when they look around, that they have assembled forces sufficient to deal with other emergencies not yet before us, and thus we may gather an ever-growing company, ranged under standards of law and justice, submitting themselves to principles that they are ready to enforce: and thus, by military and moral means combined, we may once more regain the ascendant and the initiative for the free peoples of the world and throughout the Empire.Do not let anyone suppose that this is a mere question of hardening one’s heart and keeping a stiff upper lip, and standing by to see Czechoslovakia pole-axed or tortured as Austria has been.
Churchill	0	Something more than that particular kind of fortitude will be needed from us.
Churchill	0	It is not only Czechoslovakia that will suffer.
Churchill	0	Look at the States of the Danube Basin.
Churchill	0	First and foremost there is Yugoslavia.
Churchill	0	That is a most powerful and virile State, three-quarters of whose martial people are undoubtedly in the fullest sympathy with the democracy of France and Great Britain, and are animated by an ardent hatred of Nazi or Fascist rule.
Churchill	0	They have a rooted desire to maintain themselves in their independence.
Churchill	0	Is nothing being done to ascertain what Yugoslavia would do, assuming that Great Britain and France were prepared to interest themselves in the problems of the Danube Basin?
Churchill	0	Yugoslavia might well be gained, and I am told that the effect of that on Bulgaria would probably be to draw her into the same orbit.
Churchill	0	Then there is Rumania, so directly menaced by the potential German movement to the East.
Churchill	0	These three countries if left alone, and convinced that there is no will power operating against the Dictators, will fall one by one into the Nazi grip and system.
Churchill	0	What then will be the position of Greece and Turkey?I ask these questions, hoping that they may be carefully considered.
Churchill	0	Is it not possible that decided action by France and Great Britain would rally the whole of these five States as well as Czechoslovakia, all of whom have powerful armies, who together aggregate 75,000,000 of people, who have several millions of fighting men already trained, who have immense resources, who all wish to dwell in peace within their habitations, who individually may be broken by defeat and despoiled, but who, united, constitute an immense resisting power?
Churchill	0	Can nothing be done to keep them secure and free and to unite them in their own interests, in French and British interests and, above all, in the interests of peace?
Churchill	0	Are we really going to let the whole of these tremendous possibilities fall away without a concerted effort of any kind?
Churchill	0	If we do, let us not suppose for a moment that we shall ourselves have escaped our perils.
Churchill	0	On the contrary, we shall have multiplied our perils, for a very obvious reason:At present Germany might contemplate a short war, but, once she has laid hands on these countries and extended her power to the Black Sea, the Nazi régime will be able to feed itself indefinitely, however long war may last, and thus we may weaken the deterrent force against war of that blockade to which the hon.
Churchill	0	Member who has just spoken referred.
Churchill	0	We should have removed another of the deterrents that stand between us and war.
Churchill	0	The Nazification of the whole of the Danube States is a danger of the first capital magnitude to the British Empire.
Churchill	0	Is all to go for nothing?
Churchill	0	Is it all to be whistled down the wind?
Churchill	0	If so, we shall repent in blood and tears our improvidence and our lack of foresight and energy.I have set the issue before the House in terms which do not shirk realities.
Churchill	0	It has been said by almost all speakers that, if we do not stand up to the Dictators now, we shall only prepare the day when we shall have to stand up to them under far more adverse conditions.
Churchill	0	Two years ago it was safe, three years ago it was easy, and four years ago a mere dispatch might have rectified the position.
Churchill	0	But where shall we be a year hence?
Churchill	0	Where shall we be in 1940?
Churchill	0	In these next few months all these substantial countries will be deciding whether they will rally, as they would desire to do, to the standards of civilization which still fly over Geneva, or whether they will be forced to throw in their lot and adopt the system and the doctrines of the Nazi Powers.
Churchill	0	The Prime Minister spoke about the negotiations with Italy.
Churchill	0	I forbear to comment upon them, because I prefer to await the results when they are presented to us.
Churchill	0	I know no more effective means of aiding those negotiations than the creation of a Danubian block, and nothing that would make it more likely that any engagement entered into would bear fruit and be effective in the hour of serious need.
Churchill	0	I trust that the Government will do their utmost.
Churchill	0	If it is too late, the evil is upon us, but do not let any chance be thrown away of endeavouring to save this great area from being overrun, exploited and despoiled.I now come to the second aspect of the deterrents which we are assembling against aggression—namely, national defence.
Churchill	0	I welcome very much the announcement that the Prime Minister has made in this respect, and particularly his decision to consult the trade unions.
Churchill	0	I know that he is averse from hasty decisions.
Churchill	0	No one can say that this is a hasty decision in the third year of rearmament.
Churchill	0	I was very glad also to hear the reassurance that drastic action will be taken to augment the speed of our air programme, of our air raid precautions system and of our anti-aircraft artillery.
Churchill	0	It is only a fortnight ago that my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend told us he was satisfied that we were making the best and the most effective use of our resources.
Churchill	0	However, it appears that there were other resources not being used which now will be used in a greater effort.
Churchill	0	I regret very much that these additional resources have not been applied during the last two years, when the air programme was seen to be trailing so far behind.
Churchill	0	Not only did we start two years too late, but the second two years have been traversed at only half-speed.The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence said a fortnight ago in rebuking me: “I detected in Mr Churchill’s demands a fundamental difference of opinion with the Government, for he contemplates a great deal more interference with industry than has hitherto taken place.”I was sorry to be told I was in fundamental difference with the Government, and I am glad to know from the Prime Minister’s statement that this particular fundamental difference is likely very soon to be removed.
Churchill	0	However, I must say I do not feel sure even now, after this latest decision, that the problem of rearmament is being dealt with on right lines.Is the method of organization to be employed adapted to a nation-wide effort?
Churchill	0	Ought there not to be created, however tardily, a Ministry of Supply?
Churchill	0	Ought there not to be created a far more effective Ministry of Defence?
Churchill	0	Are there not problems pressing for solution which can be handled only by a Minister of Defence?
Churchill	0	Ought there not to be a Defence of the Realm Act giving the necessary powers to divert industry, as far as may be necessary, from the ordinary channels of commerce so as to fit our rearmament in with the needs of our export trade and yet make sure that rearmament has the supreme priority?I will venture to echo the question which was posed by Mr Amery last week.
Churchill	0	Is our system of government adapted to the present fierce, swift movement of events?
Churchill	0	Twenty-two gentlemen of blameless party character sitting round an overcrowded table, each having a voice—is that a system which can reach decisions from week to week and cope with the problems descending upon us and with the men at the head of the dictator States?
Churchill	0	It broke down hopelessly in the War.But is this peace in which we are living?
Churchill	0	Is it not war without cannon firing?
Churchill	0	Is it not war of a decisive character, where victories are gained and territories conquered, and where ascendancy and dominance are established over large populations with extraordinary rapidity?
Churchill	0	If we are to prevent this bloodless war being turned into a bloody war, ought not His Majesty’s Government to adopt a system more on a level with the period of crisis in which we live?Let me give a warning drawn from our recent experiences.
Churchill	0	Very likely this immediate crisis will pass, will dissipate itself and calm down.
Churchill	0	After a boa constrictor has devoured its prey it often has a considerable digestive spell.
Churchill	0	It was so after the revelation of the secret German air force.
Churchill	0	There was a pause.
Churchill	0	It was so after German conscription was proclaimed in breach of the Treaty.
Churchill	0	It was so after the Rhineland was forcibly occupied.
Churchill	0	The House may recall that we were told how glad we ought to be because there would be no question of fortifying it.
Churchill	0	Now, after Austria has been struck down, we are all disturbed and alarmed, but in a little while there may be another pause.
Churchill	0	There may not—we cannot tell.
Churchill	0	But if there is a pause, then people will be saying, “See how the alarmists have been confuted; Europe has calmed down, it has all blown over, and the war scare has passed away.”The Prime Minister will perhaps repeat what he said a few weeks ago, that the tension in Europe is greatly relaxed.
Churchill	0	The Times will write a leading article to say how silly those people look who on the morrow of the Austrian incorporation raised a clamour for exceptional action in foreign policy and home defence, and how wise the Government were not to let themselves be carried away by this passing incident.All this time the vast degeneration of the forces of Parliamentary democracy will be proceeding throughout Europe.
Churchill	0	Every six weeks another corps will be added to the German army.
Churchill	0	All this time important countries and great rail and river communications will pass under the control of the German General Staff.
Churchill	0	All this time populations will be continually reduced to the rigours of Nazi domination and assimilated to that system.
Churchill	0	All this time the forces of conquest and intimidation will be consolidated, towering up soon in real and not make-believe strength and superiority.
Churchill	0	Then presently will come another stroke.
Churchill	0	Upon whom?
Churchill	0	Our questions with Germany are unsettled and unanswered.
Churchill	0	We cannot tell.
Churchill	0	What I dread is that the impulse now given to active effort may pass away when the dangers are not diminishing, but accumulating and gathering as country after country is involved in the Nazi system, and as their vast preparations reach their final perfection.For five years I have talked to the House on these matters—not with very great success.
Churchill	0	I have watched this famous island descending incontinently, fecklessly, the stairway which leads to a dark gulf.
Churchill	0	It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a bit the carpet ends.
Churchill	0	A little farther on there are only flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath your feet.
Churchill	0	Look back over the last five years.
Churchill	0	It is true that great mistakes were made in the years immediately after the War.
Churchill	0	But at Locarno we laid the foundation from which a great forward movement could have been made.
Churchill	0	Look back upon the last five years—since, that is to say, Germany began to rearm in earnest and openly to seek revenge.
Churchill	0	If we study the history of Rome and Carthage, we can understand what happened and why.
Churchill	0	It is not difficult to form an intelligent view about the three Punic Wars; but if mortal catastrophe should overtake the British Nation and the British Empire, historians a thousand years hence will still be baffled by the mystery of our affairs.
Churchill	0	They will never understand how it was that a victorious nation, with everything in hand, suffered themselves to be brought low, and to cast away all that they had gained by measureless sacrifice and absolute victory—gone with the wind!Now the victors are the vanquished, and those who threw down their arms in the field and sued for an armistice are striding on to world mastery.
Churchill	0	That is the position—that is the terrible transformation that has taken place bit by bit.
Churchill	0	I rejoice to hear from the Prime Minister that a further supreme effort is to be made to place us in a position of security.
Churchill	0	Now is the time at last to rouse the nation.
Churchill	0	Perhaps it is the last time it can be roused with a chance of preventing war, or with a chance of coming through to victory should our efforts to prevent war fail.
Churchill	0	We should lay aside every hindrance and endeavour by uniting the whole force and spirit of our people to raise again a great British nation standing up before all the world; for such a nation, rising in its ancient vigour, can even at this hour save civilization.
Churchill	0	http://ia600205.us.archive.org/19/items/Winston_Churchill/1938-04-30_BBC_Winston_Churchill_To_The_Royal_Academy_Of_Arts.mp3
Churchill	0	Nothing is more certain or more obvious than that recrimination or controversy at this time would be not only useless but harmful and wrong.
Churchill	0	What is done is done.
Churchill	0	What has been done or left undone belongs to history, and to history, so far as I am concerned, it shall be left.I will, therefore, make two observations only.
Churchill	0	The first is this: It is clear from what we have been told this afternoon that there was at no time any constitutional issue between the King and his Ministers or between the King and Parliament.
Churchill	0	The supremacy of Parliament over the Crown; the duty of the Sovereign to act in accordance with the advice of his Ministers; neither of those was ever at any moment in question.Supporting my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend the Leader of the Liberal party, I venture to say that no Sovereign has ever conformed more strictly or more faithfully to the letter and spirit of the Constitution than his present Majesty.
Churchill	0	In fact, he has voluntarily made a sacrifice for the peace and strength of his Realm which goes far beyond the bounds required by the law and the Constitution.
Churchill	0	That is my first observation.My second is this: I have, throughout, pleaded for time: anyone can see how grave would have been the evils of protracted controversy.
Churchill	0	On the other hand, it was.
Churchill	0	in my view, our duty to endure these evils even at serious inconvenience, if there was any hope that time would bring a solution.
Churchill	0	Whether there was any hope or not is a mystery which, at the present time, it is impossible to resolve.
Churchill	0	Time was also important from another point of view.
Churchill	0	It was essential that there should be no room for aspersions, after the event, that the King had been hurried in his decision.
Churchill	0	I believe that, if this decision had been taken last week, it could not have been declared that it was an unhurried decision, so far as the King himself was concerned, but now I accept wholeheartedly what the Prime Minister has proved, namely, that the decision taken this week has been taken by His Majesty freely, voluntarily and spontaneously, in his own time and in his own way.
Churchill	0	As I have been looking at this matter, as is well known, from an angle different from that of most hon.
Churchill	0	Members.
Churchill	0	I thought it my duty to place this fact also upon record.That is all I have to say upon the disputable part of this matter, but I hope the House will  bear with me for a  minute  or two, because it was my duty as Home Secretary, more than a quarter of a century ago, to stand beside his present Majesty and proclaim his style and titles at his investiture as Prince of Wales amid the sunlit battlements of Carnarvon Castle, and ever since then he has honoured me here, and also in wartime, with his personal kindness and, I may even say.
Churchill	0	friendship.
Churchill	0	I should have been ashamed if, in my independent and unofficial position.
Churchill	0	I had not cast about for every lawful means, even the most forlorn, to keep him on the Throne of his fathers, to which he only recently succeeded amid the hopes and prayers of all.In this Prince  there were  discerned qualities of courage, of simplicity, of sympathy, and, above all, of sincerity, qualities rare and precious which might have made his reign glorious in the annals of this ancient monarchy.
Churchill	0	It is the acme of tragedy that these very virtues should, in the private sphere, have led only to this melancholy and bitter conclusion.
Churchill	0	But, although our hopes to-day are withered, still I will assert that his personality will not go down uncherished to future ages, that it will be particularly remembered in the homes of his poorer subjects, and that they will ever wish from the bottom of their hearts for his private peace and happiness and for the happiness of those who are dear to him.I must say one word more, and 1 say it specially to those here and out of doors—and do not underrate their numbers—who are most poignantly afflicted by what has occurred.
Churchill	0	Danger gathers upon our path.
Churchill	0	We cannot afford we have no right to look back.
Churchill	0	We must look forward: we must obey the exhortation of the Prime Minister to look forward.
Churchill	0	The stronger the advocate of monarchical principle a man may be, the more zealously must he now endeavour to fortify the Throne and to give to His Majesty’s successor that strength which can only come from the love of a united nation and Empire.
Churchill	0	We have before us in the sphere of foreign policy three new and separate documents of importance.
Churchill	0	We have the League of Nations  resolution; we have the declarations of the Stresa Conference; and we have the Prime Minister’s article in his own organ, the News-Letter.
Churchill	0	I find myself – I think in common with the great majority of the House, not in one party but in all parties – in very general agreement with the Prime Minister and His Majesty’s Government upon the measures taken by theGovernment in these three documents.The sentiments set forth in the News-Letter about the dangers of German rearmament are akin to those which I myself have expressed several times in the last two or three years, beginning in the autumn of 1932.
Churchill	0	The Stresa declaration, including the statement that the three Powers, Great Britain Italy and France, will keep in touch with one another and are pledged to study the maintenance of peace in common, seems to be no more than national safety or national survival requires.
Churchill	0	There remains the Resolution of the Council of the League of Nations complaining of the growth of German armaments and of the unilateral violation of treaties.
Churchill	0	I have seen a great deal of criticism in quarters where one would least expect it of France for appealing to the League of Nations against Germany, and of the League of Nations for giving a faithful verdict upon the questions submitted for their judgment.When I hear extreme pacifists denouncing this act of the League of Nations I am left wondering what foundation these gentlemen offer to countries for abandoning individual national armaments.
Churchill	0	We are reminded how in a state of savagery every man is armed and is a law unto himself, but that civilization means that courts are established, that men lay aside their arms and carry their causes to the tribunal.
Churchill	0	This presupposes a tribunal to which men.
Churchill	0	when they are in doubt or anxiety, may freely have recourse.
Churchill	0	It presupposes a tribunal which is not incapable of giving a verdict.
Churchill	0	Personally I admire greatly the self-restraint and courage with which France addressed herself to the League of Nations.
Churchill	0	It was far better surely than that she should have dealt in ultimatums or should have seized territories as hostages, as would have been the practice in former generations.
Churchill	0	She appealed to the tribunal which has been set up, and I do also admire the spirit of the tribunal and of these different countries, some great and some small, drawn from different parts of the world, who showed themselves, according to their lights, prepared to give justice.If we are to be told now it was very wrong for France to go to the League of Nations, and how foolish and tactless of the League to give its opinion, if that view is to be held by those who have hitherto told us to look to this international procedure, then they have absolutely stultified all their arguments, for never again, if that is the case, will nations be prepared to abandon the security which resides in strong national armaments.
Churchill	0	All that prospect – the only prospect which opens itself before our eyes – of establishing a reign of law and building up a great international structure to which all nations will accede – that prospect and hope will dwindle and die away.
Churchill	0	Therefore, I am in general agreement with His Majesty’s Government upon all these three steps which have been taken by them in the last few months in company with other nations.If I criticize these measures it is not at all because of their character, but because of their tardiness.
Churchill	0	Why was all this not done two or three years ago?
Churchill	0	If the Prime Minister two years ago had thought what he now says in his News-Letter about the German danger, he need perhaps never have published his thoughts to the world.
Churchill	0	Instead of lecturing the German nation, now already so heavily armed, he could have imparted his ideas as wise guidance to our own Cabinet.
Churchill	0	If only the French Government two and a half years ago, when the German process of rearmament began, had laid their much-talked-of dossier before the League of Nations and demanded justice or protection from the concert of Europe: if only Great Britain.
Churchill	0	France and Italy had pledged themselves two or three years ago to work in association for maintaining peace and collective security, how different might have been our position.
Churchill	0	Indeed, it is possible that the dangers into which we are steadily advancing would never have arisen.
Churchill	0	But the world and the Parliaments and public opinion would have none of that in those days.
Churchill	0	When the situation was manageable it was neglected, and now that it is thoroughly out of hand we apply too late the remedies which then might have effected a cure.There is nothing new in the story.
Churchill	0	It is as old as the Sibylline Books.
Churchill	0	It falls into that long, dismal catalogue of the fruitlessness of experience and the confirmed unteachability of mankind.
Churchill	0	Want of foresight, unwillingness to act when action would be simple and effective, lack of clear thinking, confusion of counsel until the emergency comes, until self-preservation strikes its jarring gong -these are the features which constitute the endless repetition of history.All this leads me to the principal matter namely, the state of our national defenses and their reactions upon foreign policy.
Churchill	0	Things have got much worse, but they have also got much clearer.
Churchill	0	It used to be said that armaments depend on policy.
Churchill	0	It is not always true, but I think that at this juncture it is true to say that policy depends, to a large extent, upon armaments.
Churchill	0	It is true to say that we have reached a position where the choice of policy is dictated by considerations of defense.
Churchill	0	During the last three years, under the Government of Herr Hitler, and before him under that of Chancellor Bruning.
Churchill	0	Germany worked unceasingly upon a vast design of rearmament on a scale which would give the Germans such a predominance in Europe as would enable them, if they chose -and why should they not choose?
Churchill	0	– to reverse the results of the Great  War.
Churchill	0	The method should be noted.
Churchill	0	The method has been to acquire mastery in the air and, under the protection of that mastery, to develop – and it is fortunately a much longer process-land and sea forces which, when completed, would dominate all Europe.This design is being completed as fast as possible, and the first part of it – German ascendancy in the air – is already a fact.
Churchill	0	The military part is far advanced, and the naval part is now coming into view.For the last two years some of us have been endeavoring to convince His Majesty’s Government of the scale and pace at which German aviation was progressing.
Churchill	0	We debated it in March 1933, on the Air Estimates of 1934, in August 1934, in November 1934, and quite recently – in March 1935.
Churchill	0	On all these occasions the most serious warnings were given by private Members who spoke on this subject, of whom I was one.
Churchill	0	The alarm bells were set ringing, and even jangling, in good time if only they had been listened to.
Churchill	0	This afternoon I am not concerned with what private Members said in giving their warning, but I am bound to address myself to the main statements and promises which were elicited on these occasions from His Majesty’s Government.
Churchill	0	In March 1934 we had the first declaration of the Lord President:“Any Government of this country – a National Government more than any, and this Government – will see to it that in air strength and air power this country shall no longer be in a position inferior to any country within striking distance of our shores.”That declaration was considered of high importance.
Churchill	0	That was in March, but nothing happened until August, when, under the pressure, not, indeed, of those hon.
Churchill	0	Gentlemen in this House who were raising this matter, for their pressure could easily have been disdained but under the pressure of events, the Government produced a five years’ program for increasing the home defense portion of the Royal Air Force to 75 squadrons, comprising 880 machines, by 1939.
Churchill	0	Anyone could see that that was utterly inadequate, and that it bore no relation whatever to the pace at which German aviation was developing and to the military character which it was assuming.
Churchill	0	At that time, nine months ago, I urged that without a day’s delay measures should be taken, first to double, and then to redouble the Royal Air Force.Anyone can see now, and most of all the Ministers responsible, that the policy of doubling and redoubling the Air Force which I then proposed was the least which should have been set on foot.
Churchill	0	If nine months ago these measures had been begun you would today have been beginning to reap the harvest and beginning to obtain results, and very different would have been the position.
Churchill	0	In November some of us moved an Amendment to the Address, and I took the responsibility then of making some definite statements, or rather understatements, about the German air menace.
Churchill	0	In order that the Government should have an opportunity of consulting their expert advisers, I supplied the Lord President with a precis in advance, and upon this he made a series of strong declarations.
Churchill	0	I must read these to the House:“It is not the case that Germany is rapidly approaching equality with us.
Churchill	0	.
Churchill	0	.
Churchill	0	Her real strength is not 50 per cent, of our strength in Europe today.As for the position this time next year – that is, November of this year – so far from the German military air force being at least as strong as, and probably stronger than, our own, we estimate that we shall still have in Europe alone a margin of nearly 50 per cent”.It is quite true that my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friend in that second statement said, “Provided that there is no acceleration in Germany.” But it is very difficult to know what is acceleration when the original speed at which the German air force was constructed is not known and when the final limit at which they are aiming is known.
Churchill	0	Then came this declaration, the most important that we have had – the Prime Minister has repeated it today:“His Majesty’s Government are determined in no conditions to accept any position of inferiority with regard to what air force may be raised in Germany in the future”.Here we have an assertion that the Government, with all their sources of information, were convinced that they had, and would continue to have for many months, a large air superiority over Germany, and that in no case would they fail to maintain what has been called air parity with Germany.
Churchill	0	These assurances were accepted.
Churchill	0	Mr. Lloyd George spoke in that  debate.
Churchill	0	I remember his speech well.
Churchill	0	He declared himself completely reassured.
Churchill	0	He declared himself in agreement with the principle that we should maintain our parity, and said that he was completely reassured by the fact that we still had this air superiority and that the Government intended to maintain it unbroken in the future.
Churchill	0	The Leader of the Liberal party [Sir Herbert Samuel] accepted it, and he too rapidly decided in his own mind that the Government statement was right and that mine was wrong.That was in November.
Churchill	0	Only six weeks ago the Under-Secretary of State for Air was put up to say that at that date, in March 1935 – that is to say, last March – we had a substantial superiority over Germany, and that in November of this year we should still have superiority.
Churchill	0	Only six weeks have passed since then, and surely we are entitled to ask what has happened to bring about the extraordinary change in the whole colour and configuration of the landscape?
Churchill	0	We are told that Herr Hitler made a statement to the Foreign Secretary at Berlin in the conversations, which it now seems were most fortunately undertaken – otherwise I suppose we should never have known.
Churchill	0	We have not always been accustomed to depend for our information upon statements, however frank and friendly, that may be made by Rulers of other States.All these statements that were made by the Lord President, and later, on behalf of the Government, and under instructions from the Government by the Under-Secretary for Air, are admitted to be untrue.
Churchill	0	I do not say that they were made in bad faith, but they were utterly wrong.
Churchill	0	They were the reverse of the truth, and more than the reverse of the truth.
Churchill	0	[Laughter.]
Churchill	0	Certainly.
Churchill	0	If the Government statement was that we should be 50 percent, stronger than Germany at a certain date and we find that they are 50 per cent, stronger than we are, it was the reverse of the truth, and far worse than that.
Churchill	0	Is there a Member of the Government who will get up now and say that in November next we shall still have a 50 per cent superiority, or that we have a superiority today?
Churchill	0	No, Sir.
Churchill	0	The whole of these assertions, made in the most sweeping manner and on the highest authority, are now admitted to be entirely wrong.
Churchill	0	We have had a confession from the Prime Minister today that the then estimates have been found to be below what is now understood to be the truth.There is a second unpleasant chapter on this subject of which I will merely indicate the title and the contents.
Churchill	0	The German military machines have all been produced within the last two and a half years.
Churchill	0	Therefore they are of the latest design.
Churchill	0	An hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman has just placed in my hands a telegram which has arrived and been published in one of the evening newspapers, in which General Goering says.
Churchill	0	“We have no old machines.
Churchill	0	Our planes are the most up-to-date in existence.” Many of our designs, on the other hand, are seven or eight years old.
Churchill	0	The average of our machines these facts are perfectly well known; there is nothing in them that is not known, or I would not say it – is certainly double the age of the designs which have been created in Germany.
Churchill	0	It cannot be disputed that both in numbers and in quality Germanyhas already obtained a marked superiority over our home defense Air Force.But it is the third chapter of this story which is the most grievous.
Churchill	0	The rate and volume which the output of German military aeroplanes has attained is many times superior to our own.
Churchill	0	The Under-Secretary told us six weeks ago that the additions that would be made to our first-line air strength, which was then thought sufficient, would be 151.
Churchill	0	There is reason to believe, as I said on that occasion, that the comparable German output of military machines is between, at least.
Churchill	0	100 and 150 per month.
Churchill	0	Many people would put it much higher.
Churchill	0	The German air industry is therefore turning out military machines at perhaps ten times the rate at which ours are turned out.
Churchill	0	And those machines are being formed into squadrons for which long-trained, ardent personnel are already assembled, and for which an ample number of aerodromes are already prepared.
Churchill	0	Therefore, at the end of this year, when we were to have had a 50 per cent, superiority over Germany, they will be, at least, between three and tour times as strong as we are.
Churchill	0	[Editor’s Note: This forecast was unduly pessimistic in point of time, and in fact the German production after the original bound was slowed down.
Churchill	0	]Behind all this rapid peace-time production lies the industry of Germany, fully organized for war manufacture and steadily tending in its character to the condition of war manufacture.
Churchill	0	This can be drawn upon at any time gradually and to any extent which they choose.
Churchill	0	Where, then, is this pledge of air parity, and that we would not accept any inferiority to whatever the German air force might be?
Churchill	0	The Prime Minister said today that the Lord President’s declaration stands.
Churchill	0	It stands only as a declaration.
Churchill	0	The facts do not support the assertion.
Churchill	0	It is absolutely certain that we have lost air parity already both in the number of machines and in their quality.
Churchill	0	It is certain that at the end of this year we shall be far worse off relatively than we are now.
Churchill	0	Our home defense force will be for a long period ahead a rapidly diminishing fraction of the German air force.
Churchill	0	It may reasonably be urged that the units of the German Air Force, having been prepared in conditions of secrecy, have not at the present time acquired the efficiency of our squadrons in air tactics and in formation flying.It is very dangerous to underrate German efficiency in any military matter.
Churchill	0	All my experience has taught me to think that any such supposition would be most imprudent.
Churchill	0	Anyhow, now that the Germans are openly marshaling and exercising their squadrons and forming them with great rapidity, we may take it that six months of this summer and autumn will amply give them the combined training which they require, having regard to the long careful individual preparations which have been made.
Churchill	0	Therefore, any superiority which we may at this moment possess in personnel and in formation flying and in air maneuvering is a wasting asset, and will be gone by the end of the autumn, having regard to the enormously increased German air strength and the superiority of their machines.The Prime Minister in his article in the News-Letter used the word “ambush.” The word must have sprung from the anxieties of his heart, for it is an ambush into which, in spite of every warning, we have fallen.
Churchill	0	I have stated the position in general terms, and I have tried to state it not only moderately but quite frigidly.
Churchill	0	Here I pause to ask the Committee to consider what these facts mean and what their consequences impose.
Churchill	0	I confess that words fail me.
Churchill	0	In the year 1708 Mr. Secretary St. John, by a calculated Ministerial indiscretion, revealed to the House the fact the battle of Almanza had been lost in the previous summer because only 8000 British troops were actually in Spain out of the 29,000 that had been voted by the House of Commons for this service.
Churchill	0	When a month later this revelation was confirmed by the Government, it is recorded that the House sat in silence for half an hour, no Member caring to speak or wishing to make a comment upon so staggering an announcement.
Churchill	0	And yet how incomparably small that event was to what we have now to face.
Churchill	0	That was merely a frustration of policy.
Churchill	0	Nothing that could happen to Spain in that war could possibly have contained in it any form of danger which was potentially mortal.But what is our position today?
Churchill	0	For many months, perhaps for several years, most critical for the peace of Europe, we are inexorably condemned to be in a position of frightful weakness.
Churchill	0	If Germany were the only Power with which we were concerned, if we stood alone compared with Germany, and if there were no other great countries in Europe who shared our anxieties and dangers and our point of view, and if air warfare were the only kind of warfare by which the destinies of nations was decided, we should then have to recognize that this country, which seemed so safe and strong a few years ago, which bore with unconquerable strength all the strains and shocks of the Great War, which has guarded its homeland and its independence for so many centuries, would lie at the discretion of men now governing a foreign country.
Churchill	0	There are, however, friendly nations with whom we may concert our measures of air defense, and there are other factors, military and naval, of which in combination we can dispose.
Churchill	0	Under the grim panoply which Germany has so rapidly assumed there may be all kinds of stresses and weaknesses, economic, political and social, which are not apparent – but upon these we should not rest ourselves.It seems undoubted that there is an effective policy open to us at the present time by which we may preserve both our safety and our freedom.
Churchill	0	Never must we despair, never must we give in.
Churchill	0	but we must face facts and draw true conclusions from them.
Churchill	0	The policy of detachment or isolation, about which we have heard so much and which in many ways is so attractive, is no longer open.
Churchill	0	If we were to turn our backs upon Europe, thereby alienating every friend, we should by disinteresting ourselves in their fate invite them to disinterest themselves in ours.
Churchill	0	Is it then expected that we could go off with a wallet full of German Colonies gathered in the last war and a world-wide collection of territories and trade interests gathered in the past, when the greatness of our country was being built up, while all the time we should in this vital matter of air defense be condemned to protracted, indefinite and agonizing inferiority?
Churchill	0	Such a plan has only to be stated to be rejected.There is a wide measure of agreement in the House tonight upon our foreign policy.
Churchill	0	We are bound to act in concert with France and Italy and other Powers, great and small, who are anxious to preserve peace.
Churchill	0	I would not refuse the co-operation of any Government which plainly conformed to that test as long as it was willing to work under the authority and sanction of the League of Nations.
Churchill	0	Such a policy docs not close the door upon a revision of the Treaties, but it procures a sense of stability, and an adequate gathering together of all reasonable Powers for self-defense, before any inquiry of that character can be entered upon.
Churchill	0	In this august association for collective security we must build up defense forces of all kinds and combine our action with that of friendly Powers, so that we may be allowed to live in quiet ourselves and retrieve the woeful miscalculations of which we are at present the dupes, and of which, unless we take warning in time, we may some day be the victims.
Churchill	0	At this moment of crisis for Baldwin, a by-election was taking place in St. George’s, Westminster.
Churchill	0	At one point Baldwin considered resigning his seat and standing as a candidate, but in the event the pro-Baldwin banner was carried by Duff Cooper against an anti-Baldwin candidate vigorously supported by Beaverbrook and Rothermere.
Churchill	0	The impact of this meeting at the Albert Hall just outside the constituency was overshadowed by Baldwin’s attack the same evening on the “Press Lords,” whom he condemned as seeking “power without responsibility the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages”.
Churchill	0	The phrase came from Baldwin’s cousin, Rudyard Kipling.
Churchill	0	It was devastating.
Churchill	0	Duff Cooper won easily and Baldwin’s leadership was preserved.I think it hard that the burden of holding and organising this immense meeting should be thrown upon the Indian Empire Society.
Churchill	0	One would have thought that if there was one cause in the world which the Conservative party would have hastened to defend, it would be the cause of the British Empire in India.
Churchill	0	One would have expected that the whole force of the Conservative party machine would have been employed for months past in building up a robust, educated opinion throughout the country, and in rallying all its strongest forces to guard our vital interests.
Churchill	0	Unhappily all that influence, and it is an enormous influence, has been cast the other way.
Churchill	0	The Conservative leaders have decided that we are to work with the Socialists, and that we must make our action conform with theirs.
Churchill	0	We therefore have against us at the present time the official machinery of all the three great parties in the State.
Churchill	0	We meet under a ban.
Churchill	0	Every Member of Parliament or Peer who comes here must face the displeasure of the party Whips.
Churchill	0	Mr. Baldwin has declared that the three-party collusion must continue.
Churchill	0	And in support of that decision he has appealed to all those sentiments of personal loyalty and partisan feeling which a leader can command.
Churchill	0	Is it not wonderful in these circumstances, with all this against us, that a few of us should manage to get together here in this hall to-night?
Churchill	0	[Editor’s Note: An allusion to the great numbers who filled the building.
Churchill	0	]Our fight is hard.
Churchill	0	It will also be long.
Churchill	0	We must not expect early success.
Churchill	0	The forces marshalled against us are too strong.
Churchill	0	But win or lose, we must do our duty.
Churchill	0	If the British people are to lose their Indian Empire, they shall do so with their eyes open, and not be led blindfold into a trap.
Churchill	0	Already in our campaign we have had a measure of success.
Churchill	0	The movement and awakening of opinion in the Conservative party have already caused concern to our leaders.
Churchill	0	They feel they have to reckon with resolute forces in the party, and far beyond it, who will not be easily quelled.
Churchill	0	Already they have rejected the plan of sending a three-party delegation out to India for which Lord Irwin pleaded so earnestly.
Churchill	0	For the moment, therefore, we have a breathing space.
Churchill	0	The Socialist and subversive enemy have been thrown into disarray by the breakdown of their scheme to entice the Conservatives out to India.
Churchill	0	They are arranging their forces for a renewed attack.
Churchill	0	Mr. Gandhi, their supreme hope, is to come to London, as soon as they can persuade him to come, and here in the centre of the Empire he will discuss with British ministers and politicians the best means for breaking it up.
Churchill	0	But by that time we shall be ready too.
Churchill	0	We shall not be taken by surprise, as the country was during the Round Table Conference.
Churchill	0	We are not entirely defenceless or without means of expression.We have behind us the growing strength of Conservative opinion.
Churchill	0	We have the prospect at no great distance of a Conservative victory.
Churchill	0	Nothing will turn us from our path, or discourage us from our efforts; and by the time Mr. Gandhi has arrived here to receive the surrender of our Indian Empire, the Conservative party will not be so ready to have its name taken in vain.What spectacle could be more sorrowful than that of this powerful country casting away with both hands, and up till now almost by general acquiescence, the great inheritance which centuries have gathered?
Churchill	0	What spectacle could be more strange, more monstrous in its perversity, than to see the Viceroy and the high officials and agents of the Crown in India labouring with all their influence and authority to unite and weave together into a confederacy all the forces adverse and hostile to our rule in India?
Churchill	0	One after another our friends and the elements on which we ought to rely in India are chilled, baffled and dismissed, and finally even encouraged to band themselves together with those who wish to drive us out of the country.
Churchill	0	It is a hideous act of self-mutilation, astounding to every nation in the world.
Churchill	0	The princes, the Europeans, the Moslems, the Depressed classes, the Anglo-Indians – none of them know what to do nor where to turn in the face of their apparent desertion by Great Britain.
Churchill	0	Can you wonder that they try in desperation to make what terms are possible with the triumphant Brahmin oligarchy?I am against this surrender to Gandhi.
Churchill	0	I am against these conversations and agreements between Lord Irwin and Mr. Gandhi.
Churchill	0	Gandhi stands for the expulsion of Britain from India.
Churchill	0	Gandhi stands for the permanent exclusion of British trade from India.
Churchill	0	Gandhi stands for the substitution of Brahmin domination for British rule in India.
Churchill	0	You will never be able to come to terms with Gandhi.
Churchill	0	You have only to read his latest declarations, and compare them with the safeguards for which we are assured the official Conservatives will fight to the end, to see how utterly impossible agreement is.
Churchill	0	But let me tell you this.
Churchill	0	If at the sacrifice of every British interest and of all the necessary safeguards and means of preserving peace and progress in India, you come to terms with Gandhi, Gandhi would at that self-same moment cease to count any more in the Indian situation.Already Nehru, his young rival in the Indian Congress, is preparing to supersede him the moment that he has squeezed his last drop from the British lemon.
Churchill	0	In running after Gandhi and trying to build on Gandhi, in imagining that Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and Mr. Gandhi and Lord Irwin are going to bestow peace and progress upon India, we should be committing ourselves to a crazy dream, with a terrible awakening.No!
Churchill	0	Come back from these perilous paths while time and strength remain.
Churchill	0	Study the report of your own statutory commission headed by Sir John Simon and signed unanimously by the representatives of all the three parties in the State.
Churchill	0	Let us take that as our starting-point for any extensions we may make of self-government in India.
Churchill	0	It is very wrong that the vast majority of Conservative electors throughout the country, and the vast majority of all those who are acquainted with and have practical experience of India, and of that enormous mass of patriotic people not attached to any party, should have these vital questions settled over their heads by an agreement or an understanding between the two front benches in the House of Commons, and have their future settled as if they were a lot of sheep.We are told that three-party unity must be preserved at all costs.
Churchill	0	What does that mean?
Churchill	0	Up to the present it has only meant one thing, namely, that the Conservative party has had to toe the Socialist line, and has been dragged at the Socialist tail.
Churchill	0	Here are these Socialists, maintained in office only on sufferance or by intrigue, expecting all other parties to serve them, and to dance to their tune.
Churchill	0	We are here to-night to say ‘No, that shall not be.’ We have a right to our own convictions; we are entitled to act in accordance with them.
Churchill	0	We will certainly make our faith apparent by every means in our power, and in every quarter of the land.I repudiate the calumny which our opponents level at us that we have no policy for India but repression and force.
Churchill	0	Do not be deceived by these untruths.
Churchill	0	Do not be disquieted by exaggerations of the difficulty of maintaining order in India which are spread about for interested motives by the Socialist ministers and their allies.
Churchill	0	In the whole of the disturbances of the last year -.except on the frontier – scarcely a British soldier has been required.
Churchill	0	Very few people have been killed or severely wounded in the rioting.
Churchill	0	But how did the most of them get hurt?
Churchill	0	They got hurt not by the Indian police, but in religious fights between Moslems and Hindus.The great body of expert opinion which is represented upon the Indian Empire Society will support me when I say that a calm, capable, determined Viceroy properly supported from home could maintain peace and tranquillity in India year after year with a tenth of the repressive measures which Lord Irwin in his misguided benevolence has been compelled to employ.Neither is it true that we have no constructive policy.
Churchill	0	We take our stand upon views almost universally accepted until a few months ago.
Churchill	0	We believe that the next forward step is the development of Indian responsibility in the provincial governments of India.
Churchill	0	Efforts should be made to make them more truly representative of the real needs of the people.
Churchill	0	Indians should be given ample opportunities to try their hand at giving capable government in the provinces; and meanwhile the central Imperial executive, which is the sole guarantee of impartiality between races, creeds and classes, should   preserve its sovereign power intact, and allow no derogation from its responsibility to Parliament.
Churchill	0	Is that Diehardism?’ That is the message of the Simon report, unanimously signed by the representatives of the three parties.
Churchill	0	That is the purport of the alternative scheme submitted a few months ago by the Viceroy himself.After all, it opens immediately an immense and fertile field for Indian self-government.
Churchill	0	The provinces of India are great states and separate nations comparable in magnitude and in numbers with the leading powers of Europe.
Churchill	0	The responsible government of territories and populations as large as Germany, France, Poland, Italyor Spain is not a task unworthy of Indian capacity for self-government, so far as it has yet been displayed.
Churchill	0	It is a task the successful discharge of which would certainly not conflict with the ultimate creation of a federal system.
Churchill	0	On the contrary it is the indispensable preliminary without which no federation, desirable or undesirable, is possible.
Churchill	0	Why, the very word ‘federal’ signifies a foedus or treaty made between hitherto sovereign or autonomous states.All federations have arisen thus.
Churchill	0	In the United States of America, in Canada, in Australia, in South Africa, in every case the units have first been created.
Churchill	0	Why should these unpractised, unproved, unrepresentative, self-chosen groups of Indian politicians disdain the immense possibilities offered within the limits of the Statutory Commission’s report, and demand an immediate setting up of a United States of India, with themselves in control, and the British army at their orders?
Churchill	0	Before a Federal system for India could be set up there must be first the self-governing constituent provinces; and secondly, far greater, more real, more representative contact between the Indian political classes and the vast proletariat they aspire to rule.Even Europe cannot achieve such a united organisation.
Churchill	0	But what would be said of a scheme which handed the federal government of the United States of Europe over to political classes proportionately no larger than the inhabitants of Portugal, and no more representative of the needs and passions of a mighty continent than the inhabitants of a single city like Rome?
Churchill	0	Such are the follies we are forced to expose.
Churchill	0	We therefore resist upon the highest experience and authority the viewy hysterical megalomania of the Round Table Conference.Why is it that the principles of Government and lessons of history which we have learnt in our experience with the great self-governing dominions, which we have learnt in Canada, in South Africa and in Ireland, apply only in a limited degree to India?
Churchill	0	It is because the problem of Indian government is primarily a technical one.
Churchill	0	In India far more than in any other community in the world moral, political and economic considerations are outweighed by the importance of technical and administrative apparatus.
Churchill	0	Here you have nearly three hundred and fifty millions of people, lifted to a civilisation and to a level of peace, order, sanitation and progress far above anything they could possibly have achieved themselves or could maintain.
Churchill	0	This wonderful fact is due to the guidance and authority of a few thousands of British officials responsible to Parliament who have for generations presided over the development of India.If that authority is injured or destroyed, the whole efficiency of the services, defensive, administrative, medical, hygienic, judicial; railway, irrigation, public works and famine prevention, upon which the Indian masses depend for their culture and progress, will perish with it.
Churchill	0	India will fall back quite rapidly through the centuries into the barbarism and privations of the Middle Ages.
Churchill	0	The question at stake is not therefore the gratification of the political aspirations towards self-government of a small number of intellectuals.
Churchill	0	It is, on the contrary, the practical, technical task of maintaining the peace and life of India by artificial means upon a much higher standard than would otherwise be possible.
Churchill	0	To let the Indian people fall, as they would, to the level of China, would be a desertion of duty on the part of Great Britain.But that is not all.
Churchill	0	To abandon India to the rule of the Brahmins would be an act of cruel and wicked negligence.
Churchill	0	It would shame for ever those who bore its guilt.
Churchill	0	These Brahmins who mouth and patter the principles of Western Liberalism, and pose as philosophic and democratic politicians, are the same Brahmins who deny the primary rights of existence to nearly sixty millions of their own fellow countrymen whom they call ‘untouchable’, and whom they have by thousands of years of oppression actually taught to accept this sad position.
Churchill	0	They will not eat with these sixty millions, nor drink with them, nor treat them as human beings.
Churchill	0	They consider themselves contaminated even by their approach.
Churchill	0	And then in a moment they turn round and begin chopping logic with John Stuart Mill, or pleading the rights of man with Jean Jacques Rousseau.While any community, social or religious, endorses such practices and asserts itself resolved to keep sixty millions of fellow countrymen perpetually and eternally in a state of sub-human bondage, we cannot recognise their claim to the title-deeds of democracy.
Churchill	0	Still less can we hand over to their unfettered sway those helpless millions they despise.
Churchill	0	Side by side with this Brahmin theocracy and the immense Hindu population – angelic and untouchable castes alike – there dwell in India seventy millions of Moslems, a race of far greater physical vigour and fierceness, armed with a religion which lends itself only too readily to war and conquest.
Churchill	0	While the Hindu elaborates his argument, the Moslem sharpens his sword.
Churchill	0	Between these two races and creeds, containing as they do so many gifted arid charming beings in all the glory of youth, there is no intermarriage.The gulf is impassable.
Churchill	0	If you took the antagonisms of France and Germany, and the antagonisms of Catholics and Protestants, and compounded them and multiplied them ten-fold, you would not equal the division which separates these two races intermingled by scores of millions in the cities and plains of India.
Churchill	0	But over both of them the impartial rule of Britain has hitherto lifted its appeasing sceptre.
Churchill	0	Until the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms began to raise the question of local sovereignty and domination, they had got used to dwelling side by side in comparative toleration.
Churchill	0	But step by step, as it is believed we are going to clear out or be thrust out of India, so this tremendous rivalry and hatred of races springs into life again.
Churchill	0	It is becoming more acute every day.
Churchill	0	Were we to wash our hands of all responsibility and divest ourselves of all our powers, as our sentimentalists desire, ferocious civil wars would speedily break out between the Moslems and the Hindus.
Churchill	0	No one who knows India will dispute this.But that is not the end.
Churchill	0	The Brahmins know well that they cannot defend themselves against the Moslems.
Churchill	0	The Hindus do not possess among their many virtues that of being a fighting race.
Churchill	0	The whole south of India is peopled with races deserving all earnest solicitude and regard, but incapable of self-defence.
Churchill	0	It is in the north alone that the fighting races dwell.
Churchill	0	Bengal, for instance, does not send from her forty-five million inhabitants any soldiers to the native army.
Churchill	0	The Punjab is a place where fighting races dwell|, on the other hand, and the Pathans, together with the Ghurkas and the Sikhs, who are entirely exceptional sects of Hindus, all dwelling in the north, furnish three-quarters of the entire army in the time of peace, and furnished more than three-quarters of it in time of war.
Churchill	0	There can be no doubt therefore that the departure of the British from India, which Mr. Gandhi advocates, and which Mr. Nehru demands, would be followed first by a struggle in the North and thereafter by a reconquest of the South by the North, and of the Hindus by the Moslems.This danger has not escaped the crafty foresight of the Brahmins.
Churchill	0	It is for that reason that they wish to have the control of a British army, or failing that, a white army of janissaries officered, as Mr. Gandhi has suggested, by Germans or other Europeans.
Churchill	0	They wish to have an effective foreign army, or foreign-organised army, in order to preserve their dominance over the Moslems and their tyranny over their own untouchables.
Churchill	0	There, is the open plot of which we are in danger of becoming the dupes, and the luckless millions of Indians the victims.It is our duty to guard those millions from that fate.Let me just direct your attention once more upon these untouchables, fifty or sixty millions of them, that is to say more than the whole population of the British Isles; all living their lives in acceptance of the validity of the awful curse pronounced upon them by the Brahmins.
Churchill	0	A multitude as big as a nation, men, women and children deprived of hope and of the status of humanity.
Churchill	0	Their plight is worse than that of slaves, because they have been taught to consent not only to a physical but to a psychic servitude and prostration.I have asked myself whether if Christ came again into this world, it would not be to the untouchables of India that he would first go, to give them the tidings that not only are all men equal in the sight of God, but that for the weak and poor and downtrodden a double blessing is reserved.
Churchill	0	Certainly the success of Christianity and missionary enterprise has been greater among the untouchables than among any other class of the Indian population.
Churchill	0	The very act of accepting Christianity by one of these poor creatures involves a spiritual liberation from this obsession of being unclean; and the curse falls from their minds as by a miracle.
Churchill	0	They stand erect, captains of their fate in the broad sunlight of the world.
Churchill	0	There are also nearly five million Indian Christians in India, a large proportion of whom can read and write, and some of whom have shown themselves exceptionally gifted.
Churchill	0	It will be a sorry day when the arm of Britain can no longer offer them the protection of an equal law.There is a more squalid aspect.
Churchill	0	Hitherto for generations it has been the British policy that no white official should have any interest or profit other than his salary and pension out of Indian administration.
Churchill	0	All concession-hunters and European adventurers, company-promoters and profit-seekers have been rigorously barred and banned.
Churchill	0	But now that there is spread through India the belief that we are a broken, bankrupt, played-out power, and that our rule is going to pass away and be transferred in the name of the majority to the Brahmin sect, all sorts of greedy appetites have been excited, and many itching fingers are stretching and scratching at the vast pillage of a derelict Empire.
Churchill	0	I read in the Times newspaper, in the Times mind you, only last week of the crowd of rich Bombay merchants and millionaire millowners, millionaires on sweated labour, who surround Mr. Gandhi, the saint, the lawyer, Lord Irwin’s dear colleague and companion.
Churchill	0	What are they doing there, these men, and what is he doing in their houses?They are making arrangements that the greatest bluff, the greatest humbug and the greatest betrayal shall be followed by the greatest ramp.
Churchill	0	Nepotism, back-scratching, graft and corruption in every form will be the handmaidens of a Brahmin domination.
Churchill	0	Far rather would I see every Englishman quit the country, every soldier, every civil servant embark at Bombay, than that we should remain clutching on to the control of foreign relations and begging for trading facilities, while all the time we were the mere cloak of dishonour and oppression.If you were to put these facts, hard, solid indigestible facts, before Mr. Ramsay MacDonald or Mr. Wedgwood Benn, or Sir Herbert Samuel, they would probably reply by pointing to the follies of Lord North in the American revolution, to the achievements of Lord Durham in Canada, or to what has happened in South Africa or in Ireland.
Churchill	0	All the Socialists and some of the Liberals, together with, I am sorry to say, the official Conservatives, have got these arguments on the tip of their tongue.
Churchill	0	They represent all of us and the millions who think with us, and the instructed Anglo-Indian administrators on whose advice we rely, as being mere dullards and reactionaries who have never been able to move with the age, or understand modern ideas.
Churchill	0	We are a sort of inferior race mentally deficient, composed principally of colonels and other undesirables who have fought for Britain.
Churchill	0	They are the sole possessors and monopolists of the spirit and of the message of our generation.
Churchill	0	But we do not depend on colonels – though why Conservatives should sneer at an honoured rank in the British army I cannot tell – we depend on facts.
Churchill	0	We depend on the private soldiers of the British democracy.
Churchill	0	We place our trust in the loyal heart of Britain.
Churchill	0	Our faith is founded upon the rock of the wage-earning population of this island which has never yet been appealed to, by duty and chivalry, in vain.These great issues which arise from time to time in our history are never decided by the party caucuses.
Churchill	0	They are decided by the conscience and the spirit of the mass of the British people.
Churchill	0	It is upon the simple faith and profound unerring instinct of the British people, never yet found wanting in a crisis, that we must put our trust.
Churchill	0	We are deliberately trying to tell our story to the British masses, to the plain and simple folk to whom the fame of the British Empire is ever dear.
Churchill	0	In assailing the moral duty of Great Britain in India, the Socialist Government and all who aid and abet Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and his Socialist Government, or make their path smooth, will find they have stumbled upon a sleeping giant who, when he arises, will tread with dauntless steps the path of justice and of honour.
Churchill	0	These short remarks were delivered by Winston Churchill at the outbreak of World War II and were originally omitted from INTO BATTLE, the first volume of World War II speeches, but quickly inserted.
Churchill	0	They appear also in BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS (the US/Canadian edition of INTO BATTLE) and WINSTON S. CHURCHILL: HIS COMPLETE SPEECHES 1897-1963, Robert Rhodes James, editor, NY: Bowker, 1974, vol.
Churchill	0	6.In this solemn hour it is a consolation to recall and to dwell upon our repeated efforts for peace.
Churchill	0	All have been ill-starred, but all have been faithful and sincere.
Churchill	0	This is of the highest moral value–and not only moral value, but practical value–at the present time, because the wholehearted concurrence of scores of millions of men and women, whose co-operation is indispensable and whose comradeship and brotherhood are indispensable, is the only foundation upon which the trial and tribulation of modern war can be endured and surmounted.
Churchill	0	This moral conviction alone affords that ever-fresh resilience which renews the strength and energy of people in long, doubtful and dark days.
Churchill	0	Outside, the storms of war may blow and the lands may be lashed with the fury of its gales, but in our own hearts this Sunday morning there is peace.
Churchill	0	Our hands may be active, but our consciences are at rest.We must not underrate the gravity of the task which lies before us or the temerity of the ordeal, to which we shall not be found unequal.
Churchill	0	We must expect many disappointments, and many unpleasant surprises, but we may be sure that the task which we have freely accepted is one not beyond the compass and the strength of the British Empire and the French Republic.
Churchill	0	The Prime Minister said it was a sad day, and that is indeed true, but at the present time there is another note which may be present, and that is a feeling of thankfulness that, if these great trials were to come upon our Island, there is a generation of Britons here now ready to prove itself not unworthy of the days of yore and not unworthy of those great men, the fathers of our land, who laid the foundations of our laws and shaped the greatness of our country.This is not a question of fighting for Danzig or fighting for Poland.
Churchill	0	We are fighting to save the whole world from the pestilence of Nazi tyranny and in defense of all that is most sacred to man.
Churchill	0	This is no war of domination or imperial aggrandizement or material gain; no war to shut any country out of its sunlight and means of progress.
Churchill	0	It is a war, viewed in its inherent quality, to establish, on impregnable rocks, the rights of the individual, and it is a war to establish and revive the stature of man.
Churchill	0	Perhaps it might seem a paradox that a war undertaken in the name of liberty and right should require, as a necessary part of its processes, the surrender for the time being of so many of the dearly valued liberties and rights.
Churchill	0	In these last few days the House of Commons has been voting dozens of Bills which hand over to the executive our most dearly valued traditional liberties.
Churchill	0	We are sure that these liberties will be in hands which will not abuse them, which will use them for no class or party interests, which will cherish and guard them, and we look forward to the day, surely and confidently we look forward to the day, when our liberties and rights will be restored to us, and when we shall be able to share them with the peoples to whom such blessings are unknown.
Churchill	0	Broadcast to the United States from LondonBefore the House of Commons summer recess, Churchill makes one final effort to arouse the Great Republic, his term of endearment for the United States, from its reveries, barely four weeks before the outbreak of war in Europe.Holiday time, ladies and gentlemen!
Churchill	0	Holiday time, my friends across the Atlantic!
Churchill	0	Holiday time, when the summer calls the toilers of all countries for an all too brief spell from the offices and mills and stiff routine of daily life and breadwinning, and sends them to seek if not rest at least change in new surroundings, to return refreshed and keep the myriad wheels of civilized society on the move.Let me look back-let me see.
Churchill	0	How did we spend our summer holidays twenty-five years ago?
Churchill	0	Why, those were the very days when the German advance guards were breaking into Belgium and trampling down its people on their march towards Paris!
Churchill	0	Those were the days when Prussian militarism was -to quote its own phrase-“hacking its way through the small, weak, neighbor country” whose neutrality and independence they had sworn not merely to respect but to defend.But perhaps we are wrong.
Churchill	0	Perhaps our memory deceives us.
Churchill	0	Dr. Goebbels and his Propaganda Machine have their own version of what happened twenty-five years ago.
Churchill	0	To hear them talk, you would suppose that it was Belgium that invaded Germany!
Churchill	0	There they were, these peaceful Prussians, gathering in their harvests, when this wickedBelgium – set on by England and the Jews – fell upon them; and would no doubt have taken Berlin, if Corporal Adolf Hitler had not come to the rescue and turned the tables.
Churchill	0	Indeed, the tale goes further.
Churchill	0	After four years of war by land and sea, when Germany was about to win an overwhelming victory, the Jews got at them again, this time from the rear.
Churchill	0	Armed with President Wilson’s Fourteen Points they stabbed, we are told, the German armies in the back, and induced them to ask for an armistice, and even persuaded them, in an unguarded moment, to sign a paper saying that it was they and not the Belgians who had been the ones to begin the War.
Churchill	0	Such is history as it is taught in topsy-turvydom.
Churchill	0	And now it is holiday again, and where are we now?
Churchill	0	Or, as you sometimes ask in the United States – where do we go from here?There is a hush over all Europe, nay, over all the world, broken only by the dull thud of Japanese bombs falling on Chinese cities, on Chinese Universities or near British and American ships.
Churchill	0	But then, China is a long way off, so why worry?
Churchill	0	The Chinese are fighting for what the founders of the American Constitution in their stately language called: “Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” And they seem to be fighting very well.
Churchill	0	Many good judges think they are going to win.
Churchill	0	Anyhow, let’s wish them luck!
Churchill	0	Let’s give them a wave of encouragement – as your President did last week, when he gave notice about ending the commercial treaty.
Churchill	0	After all, the suffering Chinese are fighting our battle, the battle of democracy.
Churchill	0	They are defending the soil, the good earth, that has been theirs since the dawn of time against cruel and unprovoked aggression.
Churchill	0	Give them a cheer across the ocean – no one knows whose turn it may be next.
Churchill	0	If this habit of military dictatorships’ breaking into other people’s lands with bomb and shell and bullet, stealing the property and killing the proprietors, spreads too widely, we may none of us be able to think of summer holidays for quite a while.But to come back to the hush I said was hanging over Europe.
Churchill	0	What kind of a hush is it?
Churchill	0	Alas!
Churchill	0	it is the hush of suspense, and in many lands it is the hush of fear.
Churchill	0	Listen!
Churchill	0	No, listen carefully; I think I hear something-yes, there it was quite clear.
Churchill	0	Don’t you hear it?
Churchill	0	It is the tramp of armies crunching the gravel of the parade- grounds, splashing through rain-soaked fields, the tramp of two million German soldiers and more than a million Italians- “going on maneuvers”-yes, only on maneuvers!
Churchill	0	Of course it’s only maneuvers just like last year.
Churchill	0	After all, the Dictators must train their soldiers.
Churchill	0	They could scarcely do less in common prudence, when the Danes, the Dutch, the Swiss, the Albanians and of course the Jews may leap out upon them at any moment and rob them of their living-space, and make them sign another paper to say who began it.
Churchill	0	Besides, these German and Italian armies may have another work of Liberation to perform.
Churchill	0	It was only last year they liberated Austria from the horrors of self-government.
Churchill	0	It was only in March they freed the Czechoslovak Republic from the misery of independent existence.
Churchill	0	It is only two years ago that Signor Mussolini gave the ancient kingdom of Abyssinia its Magna Charta.
Churchill	0	It is only two months ago that little Albania got its writ of Habeas Corpus, and Mussolini sent in his Bill of Rights for King Zog to pay.
Churchill	0	Why, even at this moment, the mountaineers of the Tyrol, a German-speaking population who have dwelt in their beautiful valleys for a thousand years, are being liberated, that is to say, uprooted, from the land they love, from the soil which Andreas Hofer died to defend.
Churchill	0	No wonder the armies are tramping on when there is so much liberation to be done, and no wonder there is a hush among all the neighbors of Germany and Italy while they are wondering which one is going to be “liberated” next.The Nazis say that they are being encircled.
Churchill	0	They have encircled themselves with a ring of neighbors who have to keep on guessing who will be struck down next.
Churchill	0	This kind of guesswork is a very tiring game.
Churchill	0	Countries, especially small countries, have long ceased to find it amusing.
Churchill	0	Can you wonder that the neighbors of Germany, both great and small, have begun to think of stopping the game, by simply saying to the Nazis on the principle of the Covenant of the League of Nations: “He who attacks any.
Churchill	0	Attacks all.
Churchill	0	He who attacks the weakest will find he has attacked the strongest”?
Churchill	0	That is how we are spending our holiday over here, in poor weather, in a lot of clouds.
Churchill	0	We hope it is better with you.One thing has struck me as very strange, and that is the resurgence of the one-man power after all these centuries of experience and progress.
Churchill	0	It is curious how the English-speaking peoples have always had this horror of one-man power.
Churchill	0	They are quite ready to follow a leader for a time, as long as he is serviceable to them; but the idea of handing themselves over, lock, stock and barrel, body and soul, to one man, and worshiping him as if he were an idol?
Churchill	0	That has always been odious to the whole theme and nature of our civilization.
Churchill	0	The architects of the American Constitution were as careful as those who shaped the British Constitution to guard against the whole life and fortunes, and all the laws and freedom of the nation, being placed in the hands of a tyrant.
Churchill	0	Checks and counter-checks in the body politic, large devolutions of State government, instruments and processes of free debate, frequent recurrence to first principles, the right of opposition to the most powerful governments, and above all ceaseless vigilance, have preserved, and will preserve, the broad characteristics of British and American institutions.
Churchill	0	But in Germany, on a mountain peak, there sits one man who in a single day can release the world from the fear which now oppresses it; or in a single day can plunge all that we have and are into a volcano of smoke and flame.If Herr Hitler does not make war, there will be no war.
Churchill	0	No one else is going to make war.
Churchill	0	Britain and France are determined to shed no blood except in self-defense or in defense of their Allies.
Churchill	0	No one has ever dreamed of attacking Germany.
Churchill	0	If Germany desires to be reassured against attack by her neighbors, she has only to say the word and we will give her the fullest guarantees in accordance with the principles of the Covenant of the League.
Churchill	0	We have said repeatedly we ask nothing for ourselves in the way of security that we are not willing freely to share with the German people.Therefore, if war should come there can be no doubt upon whose head the blood-guiltiness will fall.
Churchill	0	Thus lies the great issue at this moment, and none can tell how itwill be settled.It is not, believe me, my American friends, from any ignoble shrinking from pain and death that the British and French peoples pray for peace.
Churchill	0	It is not because we have any doubts how a struggle between Nazi Germany and the civilized world would ultimately end that we pray tonight and every night for peace.
Churchill	0	But whether it be peace or war, peace with its broadening and brightening prosperity, now within our reach, or war with its measureless carnage and destruction-we must strive to frame some system of human relations in the future which will bring to an end this prolonged hideous uncertainty, which will let the working and creative forces of the world get on with their job, and which will no longer leave the whole life of mankind dependent upon the virtues, the caprice, or the wickedness of a single man.
Churchill	0	Churchill’s ‘We shall fight on the beaches’ speech on 4 June 1940 is a eulogy to the British war effort that has been immortalised in popular memory of the Second World War.
Churchill	0	As a newly appointed Prime Minister, Churchill’s first month in office was defined by the Dunkirk evacuation.
Churchill	0	Over 300,000 Allied soldiers were evacuated in a sensational rescue mission.
Churchill	0	The success was down to a combination of German errors and the brilliant execution of the evacuation plan.
Churchill	0	However, the fact remained that, with France now fallen, Britain had become an attractive target for German invasion.In this speech, Churchill’s aim was to counter the jubilant public reaction provoked by the evacuation from Dunkirk, and bring the discussion back to reality.
Churchill	0	As Churchill famously warns in the speech, “We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory.
Churchill	0	Wars are not won by evacuations.”Explore Churchill’s speech at the Churchill Archives.The circumstances required Churchill to balance two delicate points in his speech: the danger of an impending Nazi invasion, and the need to rally public support for the war effort.
Churchill	0	In the aftermath of the evacuation, despite intense relief for the return of British soldiers, Mass Observation reported profoundly low morale in many British regions.Churchill’s complex use of language has been dissected thoroughly in the years since the speech was made.
Churchill	0	Through repetition, intricate sentence structure and metaphor, this famous speech has retained its impact through to the present day.Allegedly, in the immediate aftermath of his speech, Churchill turned and whispered to a colleague: “And we’ll fight them with the butt ends of broken beer bottles because that’s bloody well all we’ve got!”Read the entire text of the speech here.
Churchill	0	Since we last met, the House has suffered a very grievous loss in the death of one of its most distinguished Members, and of a statesman and public servant who, during the best part of three memorable years, was first Minister of the Crown.The fierce and bitter controversies which hung around him in recent times were hushed by the news of his illness and are silenced by his death.
Churchill	0	In paying a tribute of respect and of regard to an eminent man who has been taken from us, no one is obliged to alter the opinions which he has formed or expressed upon issues which have become a part of history; but at the Lychgate we may all pass our own conduct and our own judgments under a searching review.
Churchill	0	It is not given to human beings, happily for them, for otherwise life would be intolerable, to foresee or to predict to any large extent the unfolding course of events.
Churchill	0	In one phase men seem to have been right, in another they seem to have been wrong.
Churchill	0	Then again, a few years later, when the perspective of time has lengthened, all stands in a different setting.
Churchill	0	There is a new proportion.
Churchill	0	There is another scale of values.
Churchill	0	History with its flickering lamp stumbles along the trail of the past, trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days.
Churchill	0	What is the worth of all this?
Churchill	0	The only guide to a man is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions.
Churchill	0	It is very imprudent to walk through life without this shield, because we are so often mocked by the failure of our hopes and the upsetting of our calculations; but with this shield, however the fates may play, we march always in the ranks of honour.It fell to Neville Chamberlain in one of the supreme crises of the world to be contradicted by events, to be disappointed in his hopes, and to be deceived and cheated by a wicked man.
Churchill	0	But what were these hopes in which he was disappointed?
Churchill	0	What were these wishes in which he was frustrated?
Churchill	0	What was that faith that was abused?
Churchill	0	They were surely among the most noble and benevolent instincts of the human heart-the love of peace, the toil for peace, the strife for peace, the pursuit of peace, even at great peril, and certainly to the utter disdain of popularity or clamour.
Churchill	0	Whatever else history may or may not say about these terrible, tremendous years, we can be sure that Neville Chamberlain acted with perfect sincerity according to his lights and strove to the utmost of his capacity and authority, which were powerful, to save the world from the awful, devastating struggle in which we are now engaged.
Churchill	0	This alone will stand him in good stead as far as what is called the verdict of history is concerned.But it is also a help to our country and to our whole Empire, and to our decent faithful way of living that, however long the struggle may last, or however dark may be the clouds which overhang our path, no future generation of English-speaking folks-for that is the tribunal to which we appeal-will doubt that, even at a great cost to ourselves in technical preparation, we were guiltless of the bloodshed, terror and misery which have engulfed so many lands and peoples, and yet seek new victims still.
Churchill	0	Herr Hitler protests with frantic words and gestures that he has only desired peace.
Churchill	0	What do these ravings and outpourings count before the silence of Neville Chamberlain’s tomb?
Churchill	0	Long, hard, and hazardous years lie before us, but at least we entered upon them united and with clean hearts.I do not propose to give an appreciation of Neville Chamberlain’s life and character, but there were certain qualities always admired in these Islands which he possessed in an altogether exceptional degree.
Churchill	0	He had a physical and moral toughness of fibre which enabled him all through his varied career to endure misfortune and disappointment without being unduly discouraged or wearied.
Churchill	0	He had a precision of mind and an aptitude for business which raised him far above the ordinary levels of our generation.
Churchill	0	He had a firmness of spirit which was not often elated by success, seldom downcast by failure, and never swayed by panic.
Churchill	0	when, contrary to all his hopes, beliefs and exertions, the war came upon him, and when, as he himself said, all that he had worked for was shattered, there was no man more resolved to pursue the unsought quarrel to the death.
Churchill	0	The same qualities which made him one of the last to enter the war, made him one of the last who would quit it before the full victory of a righteous cause was won.I had the singular experience of passing in a day from being one of his most prominent opponents and critics to being one of his principal lieutenants, and on another day of passing from serving under him to become the head of a Government of which, with perfect loyalty, he was content to be a member.
Churchill	0	Such relationships are unusual in our public life.
Churchill	0	I have before told the House how on the morrow of the Debate which in the early days of May challenged his position, he declared to me and a few other friends that only a National Government could face the storm about to break upon us, and that if he were an obstacle to the formation of such a Government, he would instantly retire.
Churchill	0	Thereafter, he acted with that singleness of purpose and simplicity of conduct which at all times, and especially in great times, ought to be the ideal of us all.When he returned to duty a few weeks after a most severe operation, the bombardment of London and of the seat of Government had begun.
Churchill	0	I was a witness during that fortnight of his fortitude under the most grievous and painful bodily afflictions, and I can testify that, although physically only the wreck of a man, his nerve was unshaken and his remarkable mental faculties unimpaired.After he left the Government he refused all honours.
Churchill	0	He would die like his father, plain Mr. Chamberlain.
Churchill	0	I sought permission of the King, however, to have him supplied with the Cabinet papers, and until a few days of his death he followed our affairs with keenness, interest and tenacity.
Churchill	0	He met the approach of death with a steady eye.
Churchill	0	If he grieved at all, it was that he could not be a spectator of our victory; but I think he died with the comfort of knowing that his country had, at least, turned the corner.At this time our thoughts must pass to the gracious and charming lady who shared his days of triumph and adversity with a courage and quality the equal of his own.
Churchill	0	He was, like his father and his brother Austen before him, a famous Member of the House of Commons, and we here assembled this morning, Members of all parties, without a single exception, feel that we do ourselves and our country honour in saluting the memory of one whom Disraeli would have called an “English worthy.”
Churchill	0	On August 15, the crisis of the battle of Britain was reached.
Churchill	0	All the resources of Fighter Command in the South were used.
Churchill	0	The most difficult and dangerous period of the Battle of Britain was between August 24 and September 6, when the German attack was directed against the R.A.F airfields in the South of England with considerable success.
Churchill	0	In this speech Churchill coined the phrase “The Few” to describe the R.A.F fighter-pilots.
Churchill	0	The phrase stuck.
Churchill	0	The final sentence of this speech, including the use of the word “benignant,” is a good example of Churchill’s choice of unexpected and assertive adjectives to make a phrase memorable.In this war nothing of this kind has yet appeared.
Churchill	0	It is a conflict of strategy, of organisation, of technical apparatus, of science, mechanics, and morale.
Churchill	0	The British casualties in the first 12 months of the Great War amounted to 365,000.
Churchill	0	In this war, I am thankful to say, British killed, wounded, prisoners, and missing, including civilians, do not exceed 92,000, and of these a large proportion are alive as prisoners of war.
Churchill	0	Looking more widely around, one may say that throughout all Europe for one man killed or wounded in the first year perhaps five were killed or wounded in 1914-15.The slaughter is only a small fraction, but the consequences to the belligerents have been even more deadly.
Churchill	0	We have seen great countries with powerful armies dashed out of coherent existence in a few weeks.
Churchill	0	We have seen the French Republic and the renowned French Army beaten into complete and total submission with less than the casualties which they suffered in any one of half a dozen of the battles of 1914-18.The entire body – it might almost seem at times the soul – of France has succumbed to physical effects incomparably less terrible than those which were sustained with fortitude and undaunted will power 25 years ago.
Churchill	0	Although up to the present the loss of life has been mercifully diminished, the decisions reached in the course of the struggle are even more profound upon the fate of nations than anything that has ever happened since barbaric times.
Churchill	0	Moves are made upon the scientific and strategic boards, advantages are gained by mechanical means, as a result of which scores of millions of men become incapable of further resistance, or judge themselves incapable of further resistance, and a fearful game of chess proceeds from check to mate by which the unhappy players seem to be inexorably bound.There is another more obvious difference from 1914.
Churchill	0	The whole of the warring nations are engaged, not only soldiers, but the entire population, men, women, and children.
Churchill	0	The fronts are everywhere.
Churchill	0	The trenches are dug in the towns and streets.
Churchill	0	Every village is fortified.
Churchill	0	Every road is barred.
Churchill	0	The front line runs through the factories.
Churchill	0	The workmen are soldiers with different weapons but the same courage.
Churchill	0	These are great and distinctive changes from what many of us saw in the struggle of a quarter of a century ago.Listen to a clip of Churchill’s speech here.There seems to be every reason to believe that this new kind of war is well suited to the genius and the resources of the British nation and the British Empire and that, once we get properly equipped and properly started, a war of this kind will be more favourable to us than the sombre mass slaughters of the Somme and Passchendaele.
Churchill	0	If it is a case of the whole nation fighting and suffering together, that ought to suit us, because we are the most united of all the nations, because we entered the war upon the national will and with our eyes open, and because we have been nurtured in freedom and individual responsibility and are the products, not of totalitarian uniformity but of tolerance and variety.If all these qualities are turned, as they are being turned, to the arts of war, we may be able to show the enemy quite a lot of things that they have not thought of yet.
Churchill	0	Since the Germans drove the Jews out and lowered their technical standards, our science is definitely ahead of theirs.
Churchill	0	Our geographical position, the command of the sea, and the friendship of the United States enable us to draw resources from the whole world and to manufacture weapons of war of every kind, but especially of the superfine kinds, on a scale hitherto practised only by Nazi Germany.Hitler is now sprawled over Europe.
Churchill	0	Our offensive springs are being slowly compressed, and we must resolutely and methodically prepare ourselves for the campaigns of 1941 and 1942.
Churchill	0	Two or three years are not a long time, even in our short, precarious lives.
Churchill	0	They are nothing in the history of the nation, and when we are doing the finest thing in the world, and have the honour to be the sole champion of the liberties of all Europe, we must not grudge these years of weary as we toil and struggle through them.
Churchill	0	It does not follow that our energies in future years will be exclusively confined to defending ourselves and our possessions.
Churchill	0	Many opportunities may lie open to amphibious power, and we must be ready to take advantage of them.One of the ways to bring this war to a speedy end is to convince the enemy, not by words, but by deeds, that we have both the will and the means, not only to go on indefinitely but to strike heavy and unexpected blows.
Churchill	0	The road to victory may not be so long as we expect.
Churchill	0	But we have no right to count upon this.
Churchill	0	Be it long or short, rough or smooth, we mean to reach our journey’s end.It is our intention to maintain and enforce a strict blockade not only of Germany but of Italy, France, and all the other countries that have fallen into the German power.
Churchill	0	I read in the papers that Herr Hitler has also proclaimed a strict blockade of the British Islands.
Churchill	0	No one can complain of that.
Churchill	0	I remember the Kaiser doing it in the last war.
Churchill	0	What indeed would be a matter of general complaint would be if we were to prolong the agony of all Europe by allowing food to come in to nourish the Nazis and aid their war effort, or to allow food to go in to the subjugated peoples, which certainly would be pillaged off them by their Nazi conquerors.There have been many proposals, founded on the highest motives, that food should be allowed to pass the blockade for the relief of these populations.
Churchill	0	I regret that we must refuse these requests.
Churchill	0	The Nazis declare that they have created a new unified economy in Europe.
Churchill	0	They have repeatedly stated that they possess ample reserves of food and that they can feed their captive peoples.In a German broadcast of 27th June it was said that while Mr. Hoover’s plan for relieving France, Belgium, and Holland deserved commendation, the German forces had already taken the necessary steps.
Churchill	0	We know that in Norway when the German troops went in, there were food supplies to last for a year.
Churchill	0	We know that Poland, though not a rich country, usually produces sufficient food for her people.
Churchill	0	Moreover, the other countries which Herr Hitler has invaded all held considerable stocks when the Germans entered and are themselves, in many cases, very substantial food producers.
Churchill	0	If all this food is not available now, it can only be because it has been removed to feed the people of Germany and to give them increased rations – for a change – during the last few months.At this season of the year and for some months to come, there is the least chance of scarcity as the harvest has just been gathered in.
Churchill	0	The only agencies which can create famine in any part of Europe now and during the coming winter, will be German exactions or German failure to distribute the supplies which they command.There is another aspect.
Churchill	0	Many of the most valuable foods are essential to the manufacture of vital war material.
Churchill	0	Fats are used to make explosives.
Churchill	0	Potatoes make the alcohol for motor spirit.
Churchill	0	The plastic materials now so largely used in the construction of aircraft are made of milk.
Churchill	0	If the Germans use these commodities to help them to bomb our women and children, rather than to feed the populations who produce them, we may be sure that imported foods would go the same way, directly or indirectly, or be employed to relieve the enemy of the responsibilities he has so wantonly assumed.Let Hitler bear his responsibilities to the full and let the peoples of Europe who groan beneath his yoke aid in every way the coming of the day when that yoke will be broken.
Churchill	0	Meanwhile, we can and we will arrange in advance for the speedy entry of food into any part of the enslaved area, when this part has been wholly cleared of German forces, and has genuinely regained its freedom.
Churchill	0	We shall do our best to encourage the building up of reserves of food all over the world, so that there will always be held up before the eyes of the peoples of Europe, including – I say deliberately – the German and Austrian peoples, the certainty that the shattering of the Nazi power will bring to them all immediate food, freedom and peace.Rather more than a quarter of a year has passed since the new Government came into power in this country.
Churchill	0	What a cataract of disaster has poured out upon us since then.
Churchill	0	The trustful Dutch overwhelmed; their beloved and respected Sovereign driven into exile; the peaceful city of Rotterdam the scene of a massacre as hideous and brutal as anything in the Thirty Years’ War.
Churchill	0	Belgium invaded and beaten down; our own fine Expeditionary Force, which King Leopold called to his rescue, cut off and almost captured, escaping as it seemed only by a miracle and with the loss of all its equipment; our Ally, France, out; Italy in against us; all France in the power of the enemy, all its arsenals and vast masses of military material converted or convertible to the enemy’s use; a puppet Government set up at Vichy which may at any moment be forced to become our foe; the whole Western seaboard of Europe from the North Cape to the Spanish frontier in German hands; all the ports, all the air-fields on this immense front, employed against us as potential springboards of invasion.
Churchill	0	Moreover, the German air power, numerically so far outstripping ours, has been brought so close to our Island that what we used to dread greatly has come to pass and the hostile bombers not only reach our shores in a few minutes and from many directions, but can be escorted by their fighting aircraft.Why, Sir, if we had been confronted at the beginning of May with such a prospect, it would have seemed incredible that at the end of a period of horror and disaster, or at this point in a period of horror and disaster, we should stand erect, sure of ourselves, masters of our fate and with the conviction of final victory burning unquenchable in our hearts.
Churchill	0	Few would have believed we could survive; none would have believed that we should to-day not only feel stronger but should actually be stronger than we have ever been before.Let us see what has happened on the other side of the scales.
Churchill	0	The British nation and the British Empire finding themselves alone, stood undismayed against disaster.
Churchill	0	No one flinched or wavered; nay, some who formerly thought of peace, now think only of war.
Churchill	0	Our people are united and resolved, as they have never been before.
Churchill	0	Death and ruin have become small things compared with the shame of defeat or failure in duty.We cannot tell what lies ahead.
Churchill	0	It may be that even greater ordeals lie before us.
Churchill	0	We shall face whatever is coming to us.
Churchill	0	We are sure of ourselves and of our cause and that is the supreme fact which has emerged in these months of trial.Meanwhile, we have not only fortified our hearts but our Island.
Churchill	0	We have rearmed and rebuilt our armies in a degree which would have been deemed impossible a few months ago.
Churchill	0	We have ferried across the Atlantic, in the month of July, thanks to our friends over there, an immense mass of munitions of all kinds, cannon, rifles, machine-guns, cartridges, and shell, all safely landed without the loss of a gun or a round.
Churchill	0	The output of our own factories, working as they have never worked before, has poured forth to the troops.
Churchill	0	The whole British Army is at home.
Churchill	0	More than 2,000,000 determined men have rifles and bayonets in their hands to-night and three-quarters of them are in regular military formations.
Churchill	0	We have never had armies like this in our Island in time of war.
Churchill	0	The whole Island bristles against invaders, from the sea or from the air.As I explained to the House in the middle of June, the stronger our Army at home, the larger must the invading expedition be, and the larger the invading expedition, the less difficult will be the task of the Navy in detecting its assembly and in intercepting and destroying it on passage; and the greater also would be the difficulty of feeding and supplying the invaders if ever they landed, in the teeth of continuous naval and air attack on their communications.
Churchill	0	All this is classical and venerable doctrine.
Churchill	0	As in Nelson’s day, the maxim holds, “Our first line of defence is the enemy’s ports.” Now air reconnaissance and photography have brought to an old principle a new and potent aid.Our Navy is far stronger than it was at the beginning of the war.
Churchill	0	The great flow of new construction set on foot at the outbreak is now beginning to come in.
Churchill	0	We hope our friends across the ocean will send us a timely reinforcement to bridge the gap between the peace flotillas of 1939 and the war flotillas of 1941.
Churchill	0	There is no difficulty in sending such aid.
Churchill	0	The seas and oceans are open.
Churchill	0	The U-boats are contained.
Churchill	0	The magnetic mine is, up to the present time, effectively mastered.
Churchill	0	The merchant tonnage under the British flag, after a year of unlimited U-boat war, after eight months of intensive mining attack, is larger than when we began.
Churchill	0	We have, in addition, under our control at least 4,000,000 tons of shipping from the captive countries which has taken refuge here or in the harbours of the Empire.
Churchill	0	Our stocks of food of all kinds are far more abundant than in the days of peace and a large and growing programme of food production is on foot.Why do I say all this?
Churchill	0	Not assuredly to boast; not assuredly to give the slightest countenance to complacency.
Churchill	0	The dangers we face are still enormous, but so are our advantages and resources.I recount them because the people have a right to know that there are solid grounds for the confidence which we feel, and that we have good reason to believe ourselves capable, as I said in a very dark hour two months ago, of continuing the war “if necessary alone, if necessary for years.” I say it also because the fact that the British Empire stands invincible, and that Nazidom is still being resisted, will kindle again the spark of hope in the breasts of hundreds of millions of downtrodden or despairing men and women throughout Europe, and far beyond its bounds, and that from these sparks there will presently come cleansing and devouring flame.The great air battle which has been in progress over this Island for the last few weeks has recently attained a high intensity.
Churchill	0	It is too soon to attempt to assign limits either to its scale or to its duration.
Churchill	0	We must certainly expect that greater efforts will be made by the enemy than any he has so far put forth.
Churchill	0	Hostile air fields are still being developed in France and the Low Countries, and the movement of squadrons and material for attacking us is still proceeding.It is quite plain that Herr Hitler could not admit defeat in his air attack on Great Britain without sustaining most serious injury.
Churchill	0	If, after all his boastings and blood-curdling threats and lurid accounts trumpeted round the world of the damage he has inflicted, of the vast numbers of our Air Force he has shot down, so he says, with so little loss to himself; if after tales of the panic-stricken British crushed in their holes cursing the plutocratic Parliament which has led them to such a plight; if after all this his whole air onslaught were forced after a while tamely to peter out, the Fuehrer’s reputation for veracity of statement might be seriously impugned.
Churchill	0	We may be sure, therefore, that he will continue as long as he has the strength to do so, and as long as any preoccupations he may have in respect of the Russian Air Force allow him to do so.On the other hand, the conditions and course of the fighting have so far been favourable to us.
Churchill	0	I told the House two months ago that whereas in France our fighter aircraft were wont to inflict a loss of two or three to one upon the Germans, and in the fighting at Dunkirk, which was a kind of no-man’s-land, a loss of about three or four to one, we expected that in an attack on this Island we should achieve a larger ratio.
Churchill	0	This has certainly come true.
Churchill	0	It must also be remembered that all the enemy machines and pilots which are shot down over our Island, or over the seas which surround it, are either destroyed or captured; whereas a considerable proportion of our machines, and also of our pilots, are saved, and soon again in many cases come into action.A vast and admirable system of salvage, directed by the Ministry of Aircraft Production, ensures the speediest return to the fighting line of damaged machines, and the most provident and speedy use of all the spare parts and material.
Churchill	0	At the same time the splendid, nay, astounding increase in the output and repair of British aircraft and engines which Lord Beaverbrook has achieved by a genius of organisation and drive, which looks like magic, has given us overflowing reserves of every type of aircraft, and an ever-mounting stream of production both in quantity and quality.The enemy is, of course, far more numerous than we are.
Churchill	0	But our new production already, as I am advised, largely exceeds his, and the American production is only just beginning to flow in.
Churchill	0	It is a fact, as I see from my daily returns, that our bomber and fighter strength now, after all this fighting, are larger than they have ever been.
Churchill	0	We believe that we shall be able to continue the air struggle indefinitely and as long as the enemy pleases, and the longer it continues the more rapid will be our approach, first towards that parity, and then into that superiority in the air, upon which in a large measure the decision of the war depends.The gratitude of every home in our Island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the world war by their prowess and by their devotion.
Churchill	0	Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.All hearts go out to the fighter pilots, whose brilliant actions we see with our own eyes day after day; but we must never forget that all the time, night after night, month after month, our bomber squadrons travel far into Germany, find their targets in the darkness by the highest navigational skill, aim their attacks, often under the heaviest fire, often with serious loss, with deliberate careful discrimination, and inflict shattering blows upon the whole of the technical and war-making structure of the Nazi power.
Churchill	0	On no part of the Royal Air Force does the weight of the war fall more heavily than on the daylight bombers who will play an invaluable part in the case of invasion and whose unflinching zeal it has been necessary in the meanwhile on numerous occasions to restrain.We are able to verify the results of bombing military targets in Germany, not only by reports which reach us through many sources, but also, of course, by photography.
Churchill	0	I have no hesitation in saying that this process of bombing the military industries and communications of Germany and the air bases and storage depots from which we are attacked, which process will continue upon an ever-increasing scale until the end of the war, and may in another year attain dimensions hitherto undreamed of, affords one at least of the most certain, if not the shortest of all the roads to victory.
Churchill	0	Even if the Nazi legions stood triumphant on the Black Sea, or indeed upon the Caspian, even if Hitler was at the gates of India, it would profit him nothing if at the same time the entire economic and scientific apparatus of German war power lay shattered and pulverised at home.The fact that the invasion of this Island upon a large scale has become a far more difficult operation with every week that has passed since we saved our Army at Dunkirk, and our very great preponderance of sea-power enable us to turn our eyes and to turn our strength increasingly towards the Mediterranean and against that other enemy who, without the slightest provocation, coldly and deliberately, for greed and gain, stabbed France in the back in the moment of her agony, and is now marching against us in Africa.The defection of France has, of course, been deeply damaging to our position in what is called, somewhat oddly, the Middle East.
Churchill	0	In the defence of Somaliland, for instance, we had counted upon strong French forces attacking the Italians from Jibuti.
Churchill	0	We had counted also upon the use of the French naval and air bases in the Mediterranean, and particularly upon the North African shore.
Churchill	0	We had counted upon the French Fleet.
Churchill	0	Even though metropolitan France was temporarily overrun, there was no reason why the French Navy, substantial parts of the French Army, the French Air Force and the French Empire overseas should not have continued the struggle at our side.Shielded by overwhelming sea-power, possessed of invaluable strategic bases and of ample funds, France might have remained one of the great combatants in the struggle.
Churchill	0	By so doing, France would have preserved the continuity of her life, and the French Empire might have advanced with the British Empire to the rescue of the independence and integrity of the French Motherland.In our own case, if we had been put in the terrible position of France, a contingency now happily impossible, although, of course, it would have been the duty of all war leaders to fight on here to the end, it would also have been their duty, as I indicated in my speech of 4th June, to provide as far as possible for the Naval security of Canada and our Dominions and to make sure they had the means to carry the struggle from beyond the oceans.
Churchill	0	Most of the other countries that have been overrun by Germany for the time being have preserved valiantly and faithfully.
Churchill	0	The Czechs, the Poles, the Norwegians, the Dutch, the Belgians are still in the field, sword in hand, recognised by Great Britain and the United States as the sole representative authorities and lawful Governments of their respective States.That France alone should lie prostrate at this moment, is the crime, not of a great and noble nation, but of what are called “the men of Vichy.” We have profound sympathy with the French people.
Churchill	0	Our old comradeship with France is not dead.
Churchill	0	In General de Gaulle and his gallant band, that comradeship takes an effective form.
Churchill	0	These free Frenchmen have been condemned to death by Vichy, but the day will come, as surely as the sun will rise to-morrow, when their names will be held in honour, and their names will be graven in stone in the streets and villages of a France restored in a liberated Europe to its full freedom and its ancient fame.But this conviction which I feel of the future cannot affect the immediate problems which confront us in the Mediterranean and in Africa.
Churchill	0	It had been decided some time before the beginning of the war not to defend the Protectorate of Somaliland.
Churchill	0	That policy was changed when the French gave in, and when our small forces there, a few battalions, a few guns, were attacked by all the Italian troops, nearly two divisions, which had formerly faced the French at Jibuti, it was right to withdraw our detachments, virtually intact, for action elsewhere.
Churchill	0	Far larger operations no doubt impend in the Middle East theatre, and I shall certainly not attempt to discuss or prophesy about their probable course.
Churchill	0	We have large armies and many means of reinforcing them.
Churchill	0	We have the complete sea command of the Eastern Mediterranean.
Churchill	0	We intend to do our best to give a good account of ourselves, and to discharge faithfully and resolutely all our obligations and duties in that quarter of the world.
Churchill	0	More than that I do not think the House would wish me to say at the present time.A good many people have written to me to ask me to make on this occasion a fuller statement of our war aims, and of the kind of peace we wish to make after the war, than is contained in the very considerable declaration which was made early in the Autumn.
Churchill	0	Since then we have made common cause with Norway, Holland, and Belgium.
Churchill	0	We have recognised the Czech Government of Dr. Benes, and we have told General de Gaulle that our success will carry with it the restoration of France.I do not think it would be wise at this moment, while the battle rages and the war is still perhaps only in its earlier stage, to embark upon elaborate speculations about the future shape which should be given to Europe or the new securities which must be arranged to spare mankind the miseries of a third World War.
Churchill	0	The ground is not new, it has been frequently traversed and explored, and many ideas are held about it in common by all good men, and all free men.
Churchill	0	But before we can undertake the task of rebuilding we have not only to be convinced ourselves, but we have to convince all other countries that the Nazi tyranny is going to be finally broken.The right to guide the course of world history is the noblest prize of victory.
Churchill	0	We are still toiling up the hill; we have not yet reached the crest-line of it; we cannot survey the landscape or even imagine what its condition will be when that longed-for morning comes.
Churchill	0	The task which lies before us immediately is at once more practical, more simple and more stern.
Churchill	0	I hope – indeed I pray – that we shall not be found unworthy of our victory if after toil and tribulation it is granted to us.
Churchill	0	For the rest, we have to gain the victory.
Churchill	0	That is our task.There is, however, one direction in which we can see a little more clearly ahead.
Churchill	0	We have to think not only for ourselves but for the lasting security of the cause and principles for which we are fighting and of the long future of the British Commonwealth of Nations.Some months ago we came to the conclusion that the interests of the United States and of the British Empire both required that the United States should have facilities for the naval and air defence of the Western hemisphere against the attack of a Nazi power which might have acquired temporary but lengthy control of a large part of Western Europe and its formidable resources.We had therefore decided spontaneously, and without being asked or offered any inducement, to inform the Government of the United States that we would be glad to place such defence facilities at their disposal by leasing suitable sites in our Transatlantic possessions for their greater security against the unmeasured dangers of the future.The principle of association of interests for common purposes between Great Britain and the United States had developed even before the war.
Churchill	0	Various agreements had been reached about certain small islands in the Pacific Ocean which had become important as air fuelling points.
Churchill	0	In all this line of thought we found ourselves in very close harmony with the Government of Canada.Presently we learned that anxiety was also felt in the United States about the air and naval defence of their Atlantic seaboard, and President Roosevelt has recently made it clear that he would like to discuss with us, and with the Dominion of Canada and with Newfoundland, the development of American naval and air facilities in Newfoundland and in the West Indies.
Churchill	0	There is, of course, no question of any transference of sovereignty – that has never been suggested – or of any action being taken, without the consent or against the wishes of the various Colonies concerned, but for our part, His Majesty’s Government are entirely willing to accord defence facilities to the United States on a 99 years’ leasehold basis, and we feel sure that our interests no less than theirs, and the interests of the Colonies themselves and of Canada and Newfoundland will be served thereby.These are important steps.
Churchill	0	Undoubtedly this process means that these two great organisations of the English-speaking democracies, the British Empire and the United States, will have to be somewhat mixed up together in some of their affairs for mutual and general advantage.For my own part, looking out upon the future, I do not view the process with any misgivings.
Churchill	0	I could not stop it if I wished; no one can stop it.
Churchill	0	Like the Mississippi, it just keeps rolling along.
Churchill	0	Let it roll.
Churchill	0	Let it roll on full flood, inexorable, irresistible, benignant, to broader lands and better days.© Chartwell Trust, published by permission Curtis Brown, London
Churchill	0	During June and early July, the German Air Force was regrouped to open the vital first stage of “Operation Sea Lion” (the invasion of Britain) by destroying the Royal Air Force.
Churchill	0	The Battle of Britain began on July 10.During the last fortnight the British Navy, in addition to blockading what is left of the German Fleet and chasing the Italian Fleet, has had imposed upon it the sad duty of putting effectually out of action for the duration of the war the capital ships of the French Navy.
Churchill	0	These, under the Armistice terms, signed in the railway coach at Compiegne, would have been placed within the power of Nazi Germany.
Churchill	0	The transference of these ships to Hitler would have endangered the security of both Great Britain and the United States.
Churchill	0	We therefore had no choice but to act as we did, and to act forthwith.
Churchill	0	Our painful task is now complete.
Churchill	0	Although the unfinished battleship, the Jean Bart, still rests in a Moroccan harbor and there are a number of French warships at Toulon and in various French ports all over the world, these are not in a condition or of a character to derange our preponderance of naval power.
Churchill	0	As long, therefore, as they make no attempt to return to ports controlled by Germany or Italy, we shall not molest them in any way.
Churchill	0	That melancholy phase in our relations with France has, so far as we are concerned, come to an end.Let us think rather of the future.
Churchill	0	Today is the fourteenth of July, the national festival of France.
Churchill	0	A year ago in Paris I watched the stately parade down the Champs Elysees of the French Army and the French empire.
Churchill	0	Who can foresee what the course of other years will bring?
Churchill	0	Faith is given to us to help and comfort us when we stand in awe before the unfurling scroll of human destiny.
Churchill	0	And I proclaim my faith that some of us will live to see a fourteenth of July when a liberated France will once again rejoice in her greatness and in her glory, and once again stand forward as the champion of the freedom and the rights of man.
Churchill	0	When the day dawns, as dawn it will, the soul of France will turn with comprehension and with kindness to those Frenchmen and Frenchwomen, wherever they may be, who in the darkest hour did not despair of the Republic.In the meantime, we shall not waste our breath nor cumber our thought with reproaches.
Churchill	0	When you have a friend and comrade at whose side you have faced tremendous struggles, and your friend is smitten down by a stunning blow, it may be necessary to make sure that the weapon that has fallen from his hands shall not be added to the resources of your common enemy.
Churchill	0	But you need not bear malice because of your friend’s cries of delirium and gestures of agony.
Churchill	0	You must not add to his pain; you must work for his recovery.
Churchill	0	The association of interest between Britain and France remains.
Churchill	0	The cause remains.
Churchill	0	Duty inescapable remains.
Churchill	0	So long as our pathway to victory is not impeded, we are ready to discharge such offices of good will toward the French Government as may be possible, and to foster the trade and help the administration of those parts of the great French Empire which are now cut off from captive France, but which maintain their freedom.
Churchill	0	Subject to the iron demands of the war which we are now waging against Hitler and all his works, we shall try so to conduct ourselves that every true French heart will beat and glow at the way we carry on the struggle; and that not only France, but all the oppressed countries in Europe may feel that each British victory is a step towards the liberation of the Continent from the foulest thralldom into which it has ever been cast.All goes to show that the war will be long and hard.
Churchill	0	No one can tell where it will spread.
Churchill	0	One thing is certain: the peoples of Europe will not be ruled for long by the Nazi Gestapo, nor will the world yield itself to Hitler’s gospel of hatred, appetite and domination.And now it has come to us to stand alone in the breach, and face the worst that the tyrant’s might and enmity can do.
Churchill	0	Bearing ourselves humbly before God, but conscious that we serve an unfolding purpose, we are ready to defend our native land against the invasion by which it is threatened.
Churchill	0	We are fighting by ourselves alone; but we are not fighting for ourselves alone.
Churchill	0	Here in this strong City of Refuge which enshrines the title-deeds of human progress and is of deep consequence to Christian civilization; here, girt about by the seas and oceans where the Navy reigns; shielded from above by the prowess and devotion of our airmen-we await undismayed the impending assault.
Churchill	0	Perhaps it will come tonight.
Churchill	0	Perhaps it will come next week.
Churchill	0	Perhaps it will never come.
Churchill	0	We must show ourselves equally capable of meeting a sudden violent shock or-what is perhaps a harder test-a prolonged vigil.
Churchill	0	But be the ordeal sharp or long, or both, we shall seek no terms, we shall tolerate no parley; we may show mercy-we shall ask for none.I can easily understand how sympathetic onlookers across the Atlantic, or anxious friends in the yet-unravished countries of Europe, who cannot measure our resources or our resolve, may have feared for our survival when they saw so many States and kingdoms torn to pieces in a few weeks or even days by the monstrous force of the Nazi war machine.
Churchill	0	But Hitler has not yet been withstood by a great nation with a will power the equal of his own.
Churchill	0	Many of these countries have been poisoned by intrigue before they were struck down by violence.
Churchill	0	They have been rotted from within before they were smitten from without.
Churchill	0	How else can you explain what has happened to France?-to the French Army, to the French people, to the leaders of the French people?But here, in our Island, we are in good health and in good heart.
Churchill	0	We have seen how Hitler prepared in scientific detail the plans for destroying the neighbor countriesof Germany.
Churchill	0	He had his plans for Poland and his plans for Norway.
Churchill	0	He had his plans for Denmark.
Churchill	0	He had his plans all worked out for the doom of the peaceful, trustful Dutch; and, of course, for the Belgians.
Churchill	0	We have seen how the French were undermined and overthrown.
Churchill	0	We may therefore be sure that there is a plan-perhaps built up over years-for destroying Great Britain, which after all has the honor to be his main and foremost enemy.
Churchill	0	All I can say is that any plan for invading Britain which Hitler made two months ago must have had to be entirely recast in order to meet our new position.
Churchill	0	Two months ago-nay, one month ago-our first and main effort was to keep our best Army in France.
Churchill	0	All our regular troops, all our output of munitions, and a very large part of our Air Force, had to be sent to France and maintained in action there.
Churchill	0	But now we have it all at home.
Churchill	0	Never before in the last war-or in this-have we had in this Island an Army comparable in quality, equipment or numbers to that which stands here on guard tonight.
Churchill	0	We have a million and a half men in the British Army under arms tonight, and every week of June and July has seen their organization, their defenses and their striking power advance by leaps and bounds.
Churchill	0	No praise is too high for the officers and men-aye, and civilians-who have made this immense transformation in so short a time.
Churchill	0	Behind these soldiers of the regular Army, as a means of destruction for parachutists, air-borne invaders, and any traitors that may be found in our midst (but I do not believe there are many-woe betide them, they will get short shrift)-behind the regular Army we have more than a million of the Local Defense Volunteers, or, as they are much better called, the “Home Guard.” These officers and men, a large proportion of whom have been through the last war, have the strongest desire to attack and come to close quarters with the enemy wherever he may appear.
Churchill	0	Should the invader come to Britain, there will be no placid lying down of the people in submission before him, as we have seen, alas, in other countries.
Churchill	0	We shall defend every village, every town, and every city.
Churchill	0	The vast mass of London itself, fought street by street, could easily devour an entire hostile army; and we would rather see London laid in ruins and ashes than that it should be tamely and abjectly enslaved.
Churchill	0	I am bound to state these facts, because it is necessary to inform our people of our intentions, and thus to reassure them.This has been a great week for the Royal Air Force, and for the Fighter Command.
Churchill	0	They have shot down more than five to one of the German aircraft which have tried to molest our convoys in the Channel, or have ventured to cross the British coast line.
Churchill	0	These are, of course, only the preliminary encounters to the great air battles which lie ahead.
Churchill	0	But I know of no reason why we should be discontented with the results so far achieved; although, of course, we hope to improve upon them as the fighting becomes more widespread and comes more inland.
Churchill	0	Around all lies the power of the Royal Navy.
Churchill	0	With over a thousand armed ships under the White Ensign, patrolling the seas, the Navy, which is capable of transferring its force very readily to the protection of any part of the British Empire which may be threatened, is capable also of keeping open communication with the New World, from whom, as the struggle deepens, increasing aid will come.
Churchill	0	Is it not remarkable that after ten months of unlimited U-boat and air attack upon our commerce, our food reserves are higher than they have ever been, and we have a substantially larger tonnage under our own flag, apart from great numbers of foreign ships in our control, than we had at the beginning of the war?
Churchill	0	Why do I dwell on all this?
Churchill	0	Not, surely, to induce any slackening of effort or vigilance.
Churchill	0	On the contrary.
Churchill	0	These must be redoubled, and we must prepare not only for the summer, but for the winter; not only for 1941, but for 1942; when the war will, I trust, take a different form from the defensive, in which it has hitherto been bound.
Churchill	0	I dwell on these elements in our strength, on these resources which we have mobilized and control-I dwell on them because it is right to show that the good cause can command the means of survival; and that while we toil through the dark valley we can see the sunlight on the uplands beyond.I stand at the head of a Government representing all Parties in the State-all creeds, all classes, every recognizable section of opinion.
Churchill	0	We are ranged beneath the Crown of our ancient monarchy.
Churchill	0	We are supported by a free Parliament and a free Press; but there is one bond which unites us all and sustains us in the public regard-namely (as is increasingly becoming known), that we are prepared to proceed to all extremities, to endure them and to enforce them; that is our bond of union in His Majesty’s Government tonight.
Churchill	0	Thus only, in times like these, can nations preserve their freedom; and thus only can they uphold the cause entrusted to their care.But all depends now upon the whole life-strength of the British race in every part of the world and of all our associated peoples and of all our well-wishers in every land, doing their utmost night and day, giving all, daring all, enduring all-to the utmost-to the end.
Churchill	0	This is no war of chieftains or of princes, of dynasties or national ambition; it is a war of peoples and of causes.
Churchill	0	There are vast numbers, not only in this Island but in every land, who will render faithful service in this war, but whose names will never be known, whose deeds will never be recorded.
Churchill	0	This is a War of the Unknown Warriors; but let all strive without failing in faith or in duty, and the dark curse of Hitler will be lifted from our age.© Chartwell Trust, published by permsison, Curtis Brown, London
Churchill	0	I spoke the other day of the colossal military disaster which occurred when the French High Command failed to withdraw the northern Armies from Belgium at the moment when they knew that the French front was decisively broken at Sedan and on the Meuse.
Churchill	0	This delay entailed the loss of fifteen or sixteen French divisions and threw out of action for the critical period the whole of the British Expeditionary Force.
Churchill	0	Our Army and 120,000 French troops were indeed rescued by the British Navy from Dunkirk but only with the loss of their cannon, vehicles and modern equipment.
Churchill	0	This loss inevitably took some weeks to repair, and in the first two of those weeks the battle in France has been lost.
Churchill	0	When we consider the heroic resistance made by the French Army against heavy odds in this battle, the enormous losses inflicted upon the enemy and the evident exhaustion of the enemy, it may well be the thought that these 25 divisions of the best-trained and best-equipped troops might have turned the scale.
Churchill	0	However, General Weygand had to fight without them.
Churchill	0	Only three British divisions or their equivalent were able to stand in the line with their French comrades.
Churchill	0	They have suffered severely, but they have fought well.
Churchill	0	We sent every man we could to France as fast as we could re-equip and transport their formations.I am not reciting these facts for the purpose of recrimination.
Churchill	0	That I judge to be utterly futile and even harmful.
Churchill	0	We cannot afford it.
Churchill	0	I recite them in order to explain why it was we did not have, as we could have had, between twelve and fourteen British divisions fighting in the line in this great battle instead of only three.
Churchill	0	Now I put all this aside.
Churchill	0	I put it on the shelf, from which the historians, when they have time, will select their documents to tell their stories.
Churchill	0	We have to think of the future and not of the past.
Churchill	0	This also applies in a small way to our own affairs at home.
Churchill	0	There are many who would hold an inquest in the House of Commons on the conduct of the Governments-and of Parliaments, for they are in it, too-during the years which led up to this catastrophe.
Churchill	0	They seek to indict those who were responsible for the guidance of our affairs.
Churchill	0	This also would be a foolish and pernicious process.
Churchill	0	There are too many in it.
Churchill	0	Let each man search his conscience and search his speeches.
Churchill	0	I frequently search mine.Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the future.
Churchill	0	Therefore, I cannot accept the drawing of any distinctions between Members of the present Government.
Churchill	0	It was formed at a moment of crisis in order to unite all the Parties and all sections of opinion.
Churchill	0	It has received the almost unanimous support of both Houses of Parliament.
Churchill	0	Its Members are going to stand together, and, subject to the authority of the House of Commons, we are going to govern the country and fight the war.
Churchill	0	It is absolutely necessary at a time like this that every Minister who tries each day to do his duty shall be respected; and their subordinates must know that their chiefs are not threatened men, men who are here today and gone tomorrow, but that their directions must be punctually and faithfully obeyed.
Churchill	0	Without this concentrated power we cannot face what lies before us.
Churchill	0	I should not think it would be very advantageous for the House to prolong this Debate this afternoon under conditions of public stress.
Churchill	0	Many facts are not clear that will be clear in a short time.
Churchill	0	We are to have a secret Session on Thursday, and I should think that would be a better opportunity for the many earnest expressions of opinion which Members will desire to make and for the House to discuss vital matters without having everything read the next morning by our dangerous foes.Churchill’s ‘Their Finest Hour’ Speech ©The Churchill ArchiveThe disastrous military events which have happened during the past fortnight have not come to me with any sense of surprise.
Churchill	0	Indeed, I indicated a fortnight ago as clearly as I could to the House that the worst possibilities were open; and I made it perfectly clear then that whatever happened in France would make no difference to the resolve of Britain and the British Empire to fight on, ‘if necessary for years, if necessary alone.” During the last few days we have successfully brought off the great majority of the troops we had on the line of communication in France; and seven-eighths of the troops we have sent to France since the beginning of the war-that is to say, about 350,000 out of 400,000 men-are safely back in this country.
Churchill	0	Others are still fighting with the French, and fighting with considerable success in their local encounters against the enemy.
Churchill	0	We have also brought back a great mass of stores, rifles and munitions of all kinds which had been accumulated in France during the last nine months.We have, therefore, in this Island today a very large and powerful military force.
Churchill	0	This force comprises all our best-trained and our finest troops, including scores of thousands of those who have already measured their quality against the Germans and found themselves at no disadvantage.
Churchill	0	We have under arms at the present time in this Island over a million and a quarter men.
Churchill	0	Behind these we have the Local Defence Volunteers, numbering half a million, only a portion of whom, however, are yet armed with rifles or other firearms.
Churchill	0	We have incorporated into our Defence Forces every man for whom we have a weapon.
Churchill	0	We expect very large additions to our weapons in the near future, and in preparation for this we intend forthwith to call up, drill and train further large numbers.
Churchill	0	Those who are not called up, or else are employed during the vast business of munitions production in all its branches-and their ramifications are innumerable-will serve their country best by remaining at their ordinary work until they receive their summons.
Churchill	0	We have also over here Dominions armies.
Churchill	0	The Canadians had actually landed in France, but have now been safely withdrawn, much disappointed, but in perfect order, with all their artillery and equipment.
Churchill	0	And these very high-class forces from the Dominions will now take part in the defence of the Mother Country.Lest the account which I have given of these large forces should raise the question: Why did they not take part in the great battle in France?
Churchill	0	I must make it clear that, apart from the divisions training and organizing at home, only 12 divisions were equipped to fight upon a scale which justified their being sent abroad.
Churchill	0	And this was fully up to the number which the French had been led to expect would be available in France at the ninth month of the war.
Churchill	0	The rest of our forces at home have a fighting value for home defence which will, of course, steadily increase every week that passes.
Churchill	0	Thus, the invasion of Great Britain would at this time require the transportation across the sea of hostile armies on a very large scale, and after they had been so transported they would have to be continually maintained with all the masses of munitions and supplies which are required for continuous battle-as continuous battle it will surely be.Here is where we come to the Navy-and after all, we have a Navy.
Churchill	0	Some people seem to forget that we have a Navy.
Churchill	0	We must remind them.
Churchill	0	For the last thirty years I have been concerned in discussions about the possibilities of oversea invasion, and I took the responsibility on behalf of the Admiralty, at the beginning of the last war, of allowing all regular troops to be sent out of the country.
Churchill	0	That was a very serious step to take, because our Territorials had only just been called up and were quite untrained.
Churchill	0	Therefore, this Island was for several months particularly denuded of fighting troops.
Churchill	0	The Admiralty had confidence at that time in their ability to prevent a mass invasion even though at that time the Germans had a magnificent battle fleet in the proportion of 10 to 16, even though they were capable of fighting a general engagement every day and any day, whereas now they have only a couple of heavy ships worth speaking of-the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau.
Churchill	0	We are also told that the Italian Navy is to come out and gain sea superiority in these waters.
Churchill	0	If they seriously intend it, I shall only say that we shall be delighted to offer Signor Mussolini a free and safeguarded passage through the Strait of Gibraltar in order that he may play the part to which he aspires.
Churchill	0	There is a general curiosity in the British Fleet to find out whether the Italians are up to the level they were at in the last war or whether they have fallen off at all.Therefore, it seems to me that as far as sea-borne invasion on a great scale is concerned, we are far more capable of meeting it today than we were at many periods in the last war and during the early months of this war, before our other troops were trained, and while the B.E.F.
Churchill	0	had proceeded abroad.
Churchill	0	Now, the Navy have never pretended to be able to prevent raids by bodies of 5,000 or 10,000 men flung suddenly across and thrown ashore at several points on the coast some dark night or foggy morning.
Churchill	0	The efficacy of sea power, especially under modern conditions, depends upon the invading force being of large size; It has to be of large size, in view of our military strength, to be of any use.
Churchill	0	If it is of large size, then the Navy have something they can find and meet and, as it were, bite on.
Churchill	0	Now, we must remember that even five divisions, however lightly equipped, would require 200 to 250 ships, and with modern air reconnaissance and photography it would not be easy to collect such an armada, marshal it, and conduct it across the sea without any powerful naval forces to escort it; and there would be very great possibilities, to put it mildly, that this armada would be intercepted long before it reached the coast, and all the men drowned in the sea or, at the worst blown to pieces with their equipment while they were trying to land.
Churchill	0	We also have a great system of minefields, recently strongly reinforced, through which we alone know the channels.
Churchill	0	If the enemy tries to sweep passages through these minefields, it will be the task of the Navy to destroy the mine-sweepers and any other forces employed to protect them.
Churchill	0	There should be no difficulty in this, owing to our great superiority at sea.Those are the regular, well-tested, well-proved arguments on which we have relied during many years in peace and war.
Churchill	0	But the question is whether there are any new methods by which those solid assurances can be circumvented.
Churchill	0	Odd as it may seem, some attention has been given to this by the Admiralty, whose prime duty and responsibility is to destroy any large sea-borne expedition before it reaches, or at the moment when it reaches, these shores.
Churchill	0	It would not be a good thing for me to go into details of this.
Churchill	0	It might suggest ideas to other people which they have not thought of, and they would not be likely to give us any of their ideas in exchange.
Churchill	0	All I will say is that untiring vigilance and mind-searching must be devoted to the subject, because the enemy is crafty and cunning and full of novel treacheries and stratagems.
Churchill	0	The House may be assured that the utmost ingenuity is being displayed and imagination is being evoked from large numbers of competent officers, well-trained in tactics and thoroughly up to date, to measure and counterwork novel possibilities.
Churchill	0	Untiring vigilance and untiring searching of the mind is being, and must be, devoted to the subject, because, remember, the enemy is crafty and there is no dirty trick he will not do.Some people will ask why, then, was it that the British Navy was not able to prevent the movement of a large army from Germany into Norway across the Skagerrak?
Churchill	0	But the conditions in the Channel and in the North Sea are in no way like those which prevail in the Skagerrak.
Churchill	0	In the Skagerrak, because of the distance, we could give no air support to our surface ships, and consequently, lying as we did close to the enemy’s main air power, we were compelled to use only our submarines.
Churchill	0	We could not enforce the decisive blockade or interruption which is possible from surface vessels.
Churchill	0	Our submarines took a heavy toll but could not, by themselves, prevent the invasion of Norway.
Churchill	0	In the Channel and in the North Sea, on the other hand, our superior naval surface forces, aided by our submarines, will operate with close and effective air assistance.This brings me, naturally, to the great question of invasion from the air, and of the impending struggle between the British and German Air Forces.
Churchill	0	It seems quite clear that no invasion on a scale beyond the capacity of our land forces to crush speedily is likely to take place from the air until our Air Force has been definitely overpowered.
Churchill	0	In the meantime, there may be raids by parachute troops and attempted descents of airborne soldiers.
Churchill	0	We should be able to give those gentry a warm reception both in the air and on the ground, if they reach it in any condition to continue the dispute.
Churchill	0	But the great question is: Can we break Hitler’s air weapon?
Churchill	0	Now, of course, it is a very great pity that we have not got an Air Force at least equal to that of the most powerful enemy within striking distance of these shores.
Churchill	0	But we have a very powerful Air Force which has proved itself far superior in quality, both in men and in many types of machine, to what we have met so far in the numerous and fierce air battles which have been fought with the Germans.
Churchill	0	In France, where we were at a considerable disadvantage and lost many machines on the ground when they were standing round the aerodromes, we were accustomed to inflict in the air losses of as much as two and two-and-a-half to one.
Churchill	0	In the fighting over Dunkirk, which was a sort of no-man’s-land, we undoubtedly beat the German Air Force, and gained the mastery of the local air, inflicting here a loss of three or four to one day after day.
Churchill	0	Anyone who looks at the photographs which were published a week or so ago of the re-embarkation, showing the masses of troops assembled on the beach and forming an ideal target for hours at a time, must realize that this re-embarkation would not have been possible unless the enemy had resigned all hope of recovering air superiority at that time and at that place.In the defence of this Island the advantages to the defenders will be much greater than they were in the fighting around Dunkirk.
Churchill	0	We hope to improve on the rate of three or four to one which was realized at Dunkirk; and in addition all our injured machines and their crews which get down safely-and, surprisingly, a very great many injured machines and men do get down safely in modern air fighting-all of these will fall, in an attack upon these Islands, on friendly.
Churchill	0	soil and live to fight another day; whereas all the injured enemy machines and their complements will be total losses as far as the war is concerned.During the great battle in France, we gave very powerful and continuous aid to.
Churchill	0	the French Army, both by fighters and bombers; but in spite of every kind of pressure we never would allow the entire metropolitan fighter strength of the Air Force to be consumed.
Churchill	0	This decision was painful, but it was also right, because the fortunes of the battle in France could not have been decisively affected even if we had thrown in our entire fighter force.
Churchill	0	That battle was lost by the unfortunate strategical opening, by the extraordinary and unforseen power of the armored columns, and by the great preponderance of the German Army in numbers.
Churchill	0	Our fighter Air Force might easily have been exhausted as a mere accident in that great struggle, and then we should have found ourselves at the present time in a very serious plight.
Churchill	0	But as it is, I am happy to inform the House that our fighter strength is stronger at the present time relatively to the Germans, who have suffered terrible losses, than it has ever been; and consequently we believe ourselves possessed of the capacity to continue the war in the air under better conditions than we have ever experienced before.
Churchill	0	I look forward confidently to the exploits of our fighter pilots-these splendid men, this brilliant youth-who will have the glory of saving their native land, their island home, and all they love, from the most deadly of all attacks.There remains, of course, the danger of bombing attacks, which will certainly be made very soon upon us by the bomber forces of the enemy.
Churchill	0	It is true that the German bomber force is superior in numbers to ours; but we have a very large bomber force also, which we shall use to strike at military targets in Germany without intermission.
Churchill	0	I do not at all underrate the severity of the ordeal which lies before us; but I believe our countrymen will show themselves capable of standing up to it, like the brave men of Barcelona, and will be able to stand up to it, and carry on in spite of it, at least as well as any other people in the world.
Churchill	0	Much will depend upon this; every man and every woman will have the chance to show the finest qualities of their race, and render the highest service to their cause.
Churchill	0	For all of us, at this time, whatever our sphere, our station, our occupation or our duties, it will be a help to remember the famous lines: He nothing common did or mean, Upon that memorable scene.I have thought it right upon this occasion to give the House and the country some indication of the solid, practical grounds upon which we base our inflexible resolve to continue the war.
Churchill	0	There are a good many people who say, “Never mind.
Churchill	0	Win or lose, sink or swim, better die than submit to tyranny-and such a tyranny.” And I do not dissociate myself from them.
Churchill	0	But I can assure them that our professional advisers of the three Services unitedly advise that we should carry on the war, and that there are good and reasonable hopes of final victory.
Churchill	0	We have fully informed and consulted all the self-governing Dominions, these great communities far beyond the oceans who have been built up on our laws and on our civilization, and who are absolutely free to choose their course, but are absolutely devoted to the ancient Motherland, and who feel themselves inspired by the same emotions which lead me to stake our all upon duty and honour.
Churchill	0	We have fully consulted them, and I have received from their Prime Ministers, Mr. Mackenzie King of Canada, Mr. Menzies of Australia, Mr. Fraser of New Zealand, and General Smuts of South Africa-that wonderful man, with his immense profound mind, and his eye watching from a distance the whole panorama of European affairs-I have received from all these eminent men, who all have Governments behind them elected on wide franchises, who are all there because they represent the will of their people, messages couched in the most moving terms in which they endorse our decision to fight on, and declare themselves ready to share our fortunes and to persevere to the end.
Churchill	0	That is what we are going to do.We may now ask ourselves: In what way has our position worsened since the beginning of the war?
Churchill	0	It has worsened by the fact that the Germans have conquered a large part of the coast line of Western Europe, and many small countries have been overrun by them.
Churchill	0	This aggravates the possibilities of air attack and adds to our naval preoccupations.
Churchill	0	It in no way diminishes, but on the contrary definitely increases, the power of our long-distance blockade.
Churchill	0	Similarly, the entrance of Italy into the war increases the power of our long-distance blockade.
Churchill	0	We have stopped the worst leak by that.
Churchill	0	We do not know whether military resistance will come to an end in France or not, but should it do so, then of course the Germans will be able to concentrate their forces, both military and industrial, upon us.
Churchill	0	But for the reasons I have given to the House these will not be found so easy to apply.
Churchill	0	If invasion has become more imminent, as no doubt it has, we, being relieved from the task of maintaining a large army in France, have far larger and more efficient forces to meet it.If Hitler can bring under his despotic control the industries of the countries he has conquered, this will add greatly to his already vast armament output.
Churchill	0	On the other hand, this will not happen immediately, and we are now assured of immense, continuous and increasing support in supplies and munitions of all kinds from the United States; and especially of aeroplanes and pilots from the Dominions and across the oceans coming from regions which are beyond the reach of enemy bombers.I do not see how any of these factors can operate to our detriment on balance before the winter comes; and the winter will impose a strain upon the Nazi regime, with almost all Europe writhing and starving under its cruel heel, which, for all their ruthlessness, will run them very hard.
Churchill	0	We must not forget that from the moment when we declared war on the 3rd September it was always possible for Germany to turn all her Air Force upon this country, together with any other devices of invasion she might conceive, and that France could have done little or nothing to prevent her doing so.
Churchill	0	We have, therefore, lived under this danger, in principle and in a slightly modified form, during all these months.
Churchill	0	In the meanwhile, however, we have enormously improved our methods of defence, and we have learned what we had no right to assume at the beginning, namely, that the individual aircraft and the individual British pilot have a sure and definite superiority.
Churchill	0	Therefore, in casting up this dread balance sheet and contemplating our dangers with a disillusioned eye, I see great reason for intense vigilance and exertion, but none whatever for panic or despair.During the first four years of the last war the Allies experienced nothing but disaster and disappointment.
Churchill	0	That was our constant fear: one blow after another, terrible losses, frightful dangers.
Churchill	0	Everything miscarried.
Churchill	0	And yet at the end of those four years the morale of the Allies was higher than that of the Germans, who had moved from one aggressive triumph to another, and who stood everywhere triumphant invaders of the lands into which they had broken.
Churchill	0	During that war we repeatedly asked ourselves the question: How are we going to win?
Churchill	0	and no one was able ever to answer it with much precision, until at the end, quite suddenly, quite unexpectedly, our terrible foe collapsed before us, and we were so glutted with victory that in our folly we threw it away.We do not yet know what will happen in France or whether the French resistance will be prolonged, both in France and in the French Empire overseas.
Churchill	0	The French Government will be throwing away great opportunities and casting adrift their future if they do not continue the war in accordance with their Treaty obligations, from which we have not felt able to release them.
Churchill	0	The House will have read the historic declaration in which, at the desire of many Frenchmen-and of our own hearts-we have proclaimed our willingness at the darkest hour in French history to conclude a union of common citizenship in this struggle.
Churchill	0	However matters may go in France or with the French Government, or other French Governments, we in this Island and in the British Empire will never lose our sense of comradeship with the French people.
Churchill	0	If we are now called upon to endure what they have been suffering, we shall emulate their courage, and if final victory rewards our toils they shall share the gains, aye, and freedom shall be restored to all.
Churchill	0	We abate nothing of our just demands; not one jot or tittle do we recede.
Churchill	0	Czechs, Poles, Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians have joined their causes to our own.
Churchill	0	All these shall be restored.What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over.
Churchill	0	I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin.
Churchill	0	Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization.
Churchill	0	Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire.
Churchill	0	The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us.
Churchill	0	Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war.
Churchill	0	If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands.
Churchill	0	But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.
Churchill	0	Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, “This was their finest hour.”For more on Churchill the War Leader, visit this section.
Churchill	0	The position of the B. E.F had now become critical As a result of a most skillfully conducted retreat and German errors, the bulk of the British Forces reached the Dunkirk bridgehead.
Churchill	0	The peril facing the British nation was now suddenly and universally perceived.
Churchill	0	On May 26, “Operation Dynamo “–the evacuation from Dunkirk began.
Churchill	0	The seas remained absolutely calm.
Churchill	0	The Royal Air Force–bitterly maligned at the time by the Army–fought vehemently to deny the enemy the total air supremacy which would have wrecked the operation.
Churchill	0	At the outset, it was hoped that 45,000 men might be evacuated; in the event, over 338,000 Allied troops reached England, including 26,000 French soldiers.
Churchill	0	On June 4, Churchill reported to the House of Commons, seeking to check the mood of national euphoria and relief at the unexpected deliverance, and to make a clear appeal to the United States.From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the second week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was not immediately realized.
Churchill	0	The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders.
Churchill	0	Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium.
Churchill	0	Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.However, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of the north.
Churchill	0	Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between us and the main French Armies.
Churchill	0	It severed our own communications for food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk.
Churchill	0	Behind this armored and mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they have never known in their own.I have said this armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite.
Churchill	0	Boulogne and Calais were the scenes of desperate fighting.
Churchill	0	The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were then withdrawn by orders from this country.
Churchill	0	The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen Victoria’s Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand strong, defended Calais to the last.
Churchill	0	The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender.
Churchill	0	He spurned the offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which marked the end of a memorable resistance.
Churchill	0	Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades.
Churchill	0	Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain.
Churchill	0	At least two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome them.
Churchill	0	They have added another page to the glories of the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to be held by the French troops.Thus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open.
Churchill	0	When it was found impossible for the Armies of the north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice remained.
Churchill	0	It seemed, indeed, forlorn.
Churchill	0	The Belgian, British and French Armies were almost surrounded.
Churchill	0	Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches.
Churchill	0	They were pressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air.When, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I feared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history.
Churchill	0	I thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be re-embarked.
Churchill	0	But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition.
Churchill	0	These were the hard and heavy tidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago.
Churchill	0	The whole root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to build, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or to be led into an ignominious and starving captivity.That was the prospect a week ago.
Churchill	0	But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to fall upon us.
Churchill	0	The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid.
Churchill	0	Had not this Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from extinction in the late war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and British Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland.
Churchill	0	Yet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came.
Churchill	0	He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea.
Churchill	0	Suddenly, without prior consultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole flank and means of retreat.I asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because the facts were not clear, but I do not feel that any reason now exists why we should not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode.
Churchill	0	The surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to the sea more than 30 miles in length.
Churchill	0	Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed.
Churchill	0	So in doing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see, contact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army, who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of Allied troops could reach the coast.The enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches.
Churchill	0	Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart.
Churchill	0	They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter.
Churchill	0	Their U-boats, one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began.
Churchill	0	For four or five days an intense struggle reigned.
Churchill	0	All their armored divisions-or what Was left of them-together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the ever-narrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies fought.Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen, strained every nerve to embark the British and Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged.
Churchill	0	They had to operate upon the difficult coast, often in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire.
Churchill	0	Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves free from mines and torpedoes.
Churchill	0	It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with little or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing with them always men whom they had rescued.
Churchill	0	The numbers they have brought back are the measure of their devotion and their courage.
Churchill	0	The hospital ships, which brought off many thousands of British and French wounded, being so plainly marked were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and women on board them never faltered in their duty.Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the battle, so far as its range would allow, from home bases, now used part of its main metropolitan fighter strength, and struck at the German bombers and at the fighters which in large numbers protected them.
Churchill	0	This struggle was protracted and fierce.
Churchill	0	Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but only for the moment-died away.
Churchill	0	A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to us all.
Churchill	0	The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops.
Churchill	0	He was so roughly handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously.
Churchill	0	The Royal Air Force engaged the main strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of the jaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead.
Churchill	0	We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory.
Churchill	0	Wars are not won by evacuations.
Churchill	0	But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted.
Churchill	0	It was gained by the Air Force.
Churchill	0	Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its protective attack.
Churchill	0	They underrate its achievements.
Churchill	0	I have heard much talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this.
Churchill	0	I will tell you about it.This was a great trial of strength between the British and German Air Forces.
Churchill	0	Can you conceive a greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible, and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands?
Churchill	0	Could there have been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war than this?
Churchill	0	They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task.
Churchill	0	We got the Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted.
Churchill	0	Very large formations of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on several occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have dispersed in different directions.
Churchill	0	Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two.
Churchill	0	One aeroplane was driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more ammunition.
Churchill	0	All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant-and all our pilots have been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face.When we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and reassuring thoughts may rest.
Churchill	0	I will pay my tribute to these young airmen.
Churchill	0	The great French Army was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of armored vehicles.
Churchill	0	May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself will be defended by the skill and devotion of a few thousand airmen?
Churchill	0	There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the history of war, such an opportunity for youth.
Churchill	0	The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall back into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and shattering power, of whom it may be said that:Every morn brought forth a noble chanceAnd every chance brought forth a noble knight,deserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are ready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land.I return to the Army.
Churchill	0	In the long series of very fierce battles, now on this front, now on that, fighting on three fronts at once, battles fought by two or three divisions against an equal or somewhat larger number of the enemy, and fought fiercely on some of the old grounds that so many of us knew so well-in these battles our losses in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and missing.
Churchill	0	I take occasion to express the sympathy of the House to all who have suffered bereavement or who are still anxious.
Churchill	0	The President of the Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today.
Churchill	0	His son has been killed, and many in the House have felt the pangs of affliction in the sharpest form.
Churchill	0	But I will say this about the missing: We have had a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I would say about the missing that there may be very many reported missing who will come back home, some day, in one way or another.
Churchill	0	In the confusion of this fight it is inevitable that many have been left in positions where honor required no further resistance from them.Against this loss of over 30,000 men, we can set a far heavier loss certainly inflicted upon the enemy.
Churchill	0	But our losses in material are enormous.
Churchill	0	We have perhaps lost one-third of the men we lost in the opening days of the battle of 21st March, 1918, but we have lost nearly as many guns — nearly one thousand-and all our transport, all the armored vehicles that were with the Army in the north.
Churchill	0	This loss will impose a further delay on the expansion of our military strength.
Churchill	0	That expansion had not been proceeding as far as we had hoped.
Churchill	0	The best of all we had to give had gone to the British Expeditionary Force, and although they had not the numbers of tanks and some articles of equipment which were desirable, they were a very well and finely equipped Army.
Churchill	0	They had the first-fruits of all that our industry had to give, and that is gone.
Churchill	0	And now here is this further delay.
Churchill	0	How long it will be, how long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island.
Churchill	0	An effort the like of which has never been seen in our records is now being made.
Churchill	0	Work is proceeding everywhere, night and day, Sundays and week days.
Churchill	0	Capital and Labor have cast aside their interests, rights, and customs and put them into the common stock.
Churchill	0	Already the flow of munitions has leaped forward.
Churchill	0	There is no reason why we should not in a few months overtake the sudden and serious loss that has come upon us, without retarding the development of our general program.Nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so many men, whose loved ones have passed through an agonizing week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France and Belgium is a colossal military disaster.
Churchill	0	The French Army has been weakened, the Belgian Army has been lost, a large part of those fortified lines upon which so much faith had been reposed is gone, many valuable mining districts and factories have passed into the enemy’s possession, the whole of the Channel ports are in his hands, with all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at France.
Churchill	0	We are told that Herr Hitler has a plan for invading the British Isles.
Churchill	0	This has often been thought of before.
Churchill	0	When Napoleon lay at Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone.
Churchill	0	“There are bitter weeds in England.” There are certainly a great many more of them since the British Expeditionary Force returned.The whole question of home defense against invasion is, of course, powerfully affected by the fact that we have for the time being in this Island incomparably more powerful military forces than we have ever had at any moment in this war or the last.
Churchill	0	But this will not continue.
Churchill	0	We shall not be content with a defensive war.
Churchill	0	We have our duty to our Ally.
Churchill	0	We have to reconstitute and build up the British Expeditionary Force once again, under its gallant Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gort.
Churchill	0	All this is in train; but in the interval we must put our defenses in this Island into such a high state of organization that the fewest possible numbers will be required to give effective security and that the largest possible potential of offensive effort may be realized.
Churchill	0	On this we are now engaged.
Churchill	0	It will be very convenient, if it be the desire of the House, to enter upon this subject in a secret Session.
Churchill	0	Not that the government would necessarily be able to reveal in very great detail military secrets, but we like to have our discussions free, without the restraint imposed by the fact that they will be read the next day by the enemy; and the Government would benefit by views freely expressed in all parts of the House by Members with their knowledge of so many different parts of the country.
Churchill	0	I understand that some request is to be made upon this subject, which will be readily acceded to by His Majesty’s Government.We have found it necessary to take measures of increasing stringency, not only against enemy aliens and suspicious characters of other nationalities, but also against British subjects who may become a danger or a nuisance should the war be transported to the United Kingdom.
Churchill	0	I know there are a great many people affected by the orders which we have made who are the passionate enemies of Nazi Germany.
Churchill	0	I am very sorry for them, but we cannot, at the present time and under the present stress, draw all the distinctions which we should like to do.
Churchill	0	If parachute landings were attempted and fierce fighting attendant upon them followed, these unfortunate people would be far better out of the way, for their own sakes as well as for ours.
Churchill	0	There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the slightest sympathy.
Churchill	0	Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a strong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House, without the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than satisfied, that this malignancy in our midst has been effectively stamped out.Turning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people.
Churchill	0	In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet.
Churchill	0	There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants.
Churchill	0	Many are the tales that are told.
Churchill	0	We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver.
Churchill	0	I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye.
Churchill	0	We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to air power if it can be locally exercised.I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.
Churchill	0	At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do.
Churchill	0	That is the resolve of His Majesty’s Government-every man of them.
Churchill	0	That is the will of Parliament and the nation.
Churchill	0	The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.
Churchill	0	Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail.
Churchill	0	We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.© Chartwell Trust.

Churchill	0	German armed forces surrendered unconditionally on May 7.
Churchill	0	Hostilities in Europe ended officially at midnight, May 8.
Churchill	0	1945.Yesterday morning at 2:41 a.m. at Headquarters, General Jodl, the representative of the German High Command, and Grand Admiral Doenitz, the designated head of the German State, signed the act of unconditional surrender of all German Land, sea, and air forces in Europe to the Allied Expeditionary Force, and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.General Bedell Smith, Chief of Staff of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General Francois Sevez signed the document on behalf of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General Susloparov signed on behalf of the Russian High Command.To-day this agreement will be ratified and confirmed at Berlin, where Air Chief Marshal Tedder, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General de Lattre de Tassigny will sign on behalf of General Eisenhower.
Churchill	0	Marshal Zhukov will sign on behalf of the Soviet High Command.
Churchill	0	The German representatives will be Field-Marshal Keitel, Chief of the High Command, and the Commanders-in- Chief of the German Army, Navy, and Air Forces.Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight to-night (Tuesday, May 8), but in the interests of saving lives the “Cease fire” began yesterday to be sounded all along the front, and our dear Channel Islands are also to be freed to-day.The Germans are still in places resisting the Russian troops, but should they continue to do so after midnight they will, of course, deprive themselves of the protection of the laws of war, and will be attacked from all quarters by the Allied troops.
Churchill	0	It is not surprising that on such long fronts and in the existing disorder of the enemy the orders of the German High Command should not in every case be obeyed immediately.
Churchill	0	This does not, in our opinion, with the best military advice at our disposal, constitute any reason for withholding from the nation the facts communicated to us by General Eisenhower of the unconditional surrender already signed at Rheims, nor should it prevent us from celebrating to-day and to-morrow (Wednesday) as Victory in Europe days.To-day, perhaps, we shall think mostly of ourselves.
Churchill	0	To-morrow we shall pay a particular tribute to our Russian comrades, whose prowess in the field has been one of the grand contributions to the general victory.The German war is therefore at an end.
Churchill	0	After years of intense preparation, Germany hurled herself on Poland at the beginning of September, 1939; and, in pursuance of our guarantee to Poland and in agreement with the French Republic, Great Britain, the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations, declared war upon this foul aggression.
Churchill	0	After gallant France had been struck down we, from this Island and from our united Empire, maintained the struggle single-handed for a whole year until we were joined by the military might of Soviet Russia, and later by the overwhelming power and resources of the United States of America.Finally almost the whole world was combined against the evil-doers, who are now prostrate before us.
Churchill	0	Our gratitude to our splendid Allies goes forth from all our hearts in this Island and throughout the British Empire.We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing; but let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead.
Churchill	0	Japan, with all her treachery and greed, remains unsubdued.
Churchill	0	The injury she has inflicted on Great Britain, the United States, and other countries, and her detestable cruelties, call for justice and retribution.
Churchill	0	We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task, both at home and abroad.
Churchill	0	Advance, Britannia!
Churchill	0	Long live the cause of freedom!
Churchill	0	God save the King!
Churchill	0	[Editor’s Note: After making his broadcast announcement of Germany’s unconditional surrender, Churchill read the same statement to the House of Commons shortly afterwards and added]That is the message which I have been instructed to deliver to the British Nation and Commonwealth.
Churchill	0	I have only two or three sentences to add.
Churchill	0	They will convey to the House my deep gratitude to this House of Commons, which has proved itself the strongest foundation for waging war that has ever been seen in the whole of our long history.
Churchill	0	We have all of us made our mistakes, but the strength of the Parliamentary institution has been shown to enable it at the same moment to preserve all the title-deeds of democracy while waging war in the most stern and protracted form.
Churchill	0	I wish to give my hearty thanks to men of all Parties, to everyone in every part of the House where they sit, for the way in which the liveliness of Parliamentary institutions has been maintained under the fire of the enemy, and for the way in which we have been able to persevere-and we could have persevered much longer if need had been-till all the objectives which we set before us for the procuring of the unlimited and unconditional surrender of the enemy had been achieved.
Churchill	0	I recollect well at the end of the last war, more than a quarter of a century ago, that the House, when it heard the long list of the surrender terms, the armistice terms, which had been imposed upon the Germans, did not feel inclined for debate or business, but desired to offer thanks to Almighty God, to the Great Power which seems to shape and design the fortunes of nations and the destiny of man; and I therefore beg, Sir, with your permission to move:That this House do now attend at the Church of St. Margaret, Westminster, to give humble and reverent thanks to Almighty God for our deliverance from the threat of German domination.This is the identical Motion which was moved in former times.
Churchill	0	During the celebrations that followed the announcement of the end of the war in Europe, Churchill and his principal colleagues appeared on the balcony of the Ministry of Health in Whitehall, and made two brief speeches to the vast crowd.
Churchill	0	After the words “This is your victory” the crowd roared back, “No-it is yours.” It was an unforgettable moment of love and gratitude.“God bless you all.
Churchill	0	This is your victory!
Churchill	0	It is the victory of the cause of freedom in every land.
Churchill	0	In all our long history we have never seen a greater day than this.
Churchill	0	Everyone, man or woman, has done their best.
Churchill	0	Everyone has tried.
Churchill	0	Neither the long years, nor the dangers, nor the fierce attacks of the enemy, have in any way weakened the unbending resolve of the British nation.
Churchill	0	God bless you all.”
Churchill	0	“My dear friends, this is your hour.
Churchill	0	This is not victory of a party or of any class.
Churchill	0	It’s a victory of the great British nation as a whole.
Churchill	0	We were the first, in this ancient island, to draw the sword against tyranny.
Churchill	0	After a while we were left all alone against the most tremendous military power that has been seen.
Churchill	0	We were all alone for a whole year.Listen to part of Churchill’s speech here.There we stood, alone.
Churchill	0	Did anyone want to give in?
Churchill	0	[The crowd shouted “No.”] Were we down-hearted?
Churchill	0	[“No!”] The lights went out and the bombs came down.
Churchill	0	But every man, woman and child in the country had no thought of quitting the struggle.
Churchill	0	London can take it.
Churchill	0	So we came back after long months from the jaws of death, out of the mouth of hell, while all the world wondered.
Churchill	0	When shall the reputation and faith of this generation of English men and women fail?
Churchill	0	I say that in the long years to come not only will the people of this island but of the world, wherever the bird of freedom chirps in human hearts, look back to what we’ve done and they will say “do not despair, do not yield to violence and tyranny, march straightforward and die if need be-unconquered.” Now we have emerged from one deadly struggle-a terrible foe has been cast on the ground and awaits our judgment and our mercy.But there is another foe who occupies large portions of the British Empire, a foe stained with cruelty and greed-the Japanese.
Churchill	0	I rejoice we can all take a night off today and another day tomorrow.
Churchill	0	Tomorrow our great Russian allies will also be celebrating victory and after that we must begin the task of rebuilding our hearth and homes, doing our utmost to make this country a land in which all have a chance, in which all have a duty, and we must turn ourselves to fulfill our duty to our own countrymen, and to our gallant allies of the United States who were so foully and treacherously attacked by Japan.
Churchill	0	We will go hand and hand with them.
Churchill	0	Even if it is a hard struggle we will not be the ones who will fail.”Watch as Prime Minister Winston S Churchill announces the unconditional surrender of Germany.Read the full text of Churchill’s speech here.Visit our Calendar of Events page to see the full list of events in London to commemorate the 70th anniversary.For more information on VE Day, visit Churchill Central and the Churchill Timeline.
Churchill	0	On June 4, British and American troops entered Rome.
Churchill	0	On June 6, D-Day, the long-awaited Allied invasion of Europe began, the principal landings being in Normandy.
Churchill	0	Churchill’s statement that fighting was taking place in Caen was, however incorrect.The House should, I think, take formal cognisance of the liberation of Rome by the Allied Armies under the Command of General Alexander, with General Clark of the United States Service and General Oliver Leese in command of the fifth and Eighth Armies respectively.
Churchill	0	This is a memorable and glorious event, which rewards the intense fighting of the last five months in Italy.
Churchill	0	The original landing, made on January 22nd at Anzio, has, in the end, borne good fruit.
Churchill	0	In the first place, Hitler was induced to send to the south of Rome eight or nine divisions which he may well have need of elsewhere.
Churchill	0	Secondly, these divisions were repulsed, and their teeth broken, by the successful resistance of the Anzio bridgehead forces in the important battle which took place in the middle of February.
Churchill	0	The losses on both sides were heavy-the Allies losing about 20,000 men, and the Germans about 25,000 men.
Churchill	0	Thereafter, the Anzio bridgehead was considered by the enemy to be impregnable.Meanwhile, the great regrouping of the main Army had to take place before the attacks could be renewed.
Churchill	0	These attacks were at first unsuccessful, and Cassino still blocked the advance.
Churchill	0	On May 11th, General Alexander began his present operation, and after unceasing and intense fighting by the whole of the Armies, broke into the enemy’s lines and entered the Liri Valley.
Churchill	0	It is noteworthy that, counting from right to left, the whole of the Polish, British Empire, French, and United States Forces broke the German lines in front of them by frontal attack.
Churchill	0	That has an important bearing on other matters, which I shall come to before I sit down.At what was judged the right moment the bridgehead force, which by this time had reached a total of nearly 150,000 men, fell upon the retiring enemy’s flank and threatened his retreat.
Churchill	0	The junction of the main Armies with the bridgehead forces drove the enemy off his principal lines of retreat to the North, forcing a great part of his army to retire in considerable disorder with heavy losses, especially in material, through mountainous country.
Churchill	0	The Allied Forces, with great rapidity, were regrouped, with special emphasis on their left flank, which soon deployed against Rome after cutting the important highway.
Churchill	0	The American and other Forces of the Fifth Army broke through the enemy’s last line and entered Rome, where the Allied troops have been received with joy by the population.
Churchill	0	This entry and liberation of Rome mean that we shall have the power to defend it from hostile air attack, and to deliver it from the famine with which it was threatened.
Churchill	0	However, General Alexander’s prime object has never been the liberation of Rome, great as are the moral, political and psychological advantages of that episode.
Churchill	0	The Allied Forces, with the Americans in the van, are driving ahead, northwards, in relentless pursuit of the enemy.
Churchill	0	The destruction of the enemy army has been, throughout, the single aim, and they are now being engaged at the same time along the whole length of the line as they attempt to escape to the North.
Churchill	0	It is hoped that the 20,000 prisoners already taken will be followed by further captures in future, and that the condition of the enemy’s army, which he has crowded into Southern Italy, will be decisively affected.It would be futile to attempt to estimate our final gains at the present time.
Churchill	0	It is our duty, however, to pay the warmest tribute of gratitude and admiration to General Alexander for the skill with which he has handled this Army of so many different States and nations, and for the tenacity and fortitude with which he has sustained the long periods when success was denied.
Churchill	0	In General Clark the United States Army has found a fighting leader of the highest order, and the qualities of all Allied troops have shone in noble and unjealous rivalry.
Churchill	0	The great strength of the Air Forces at our disposal, as well as the preponderance in armour, has undoubtedly contributed in a notable and distinctive manner to the successes which have been achieved.
Churchill	0	We must await further developments in the Italian theatre before it is possible to estimate the magnitude and quality of our gains, great and timely though they certainly are.I have also to announce to the House that during the night and the early hours of this morning the first of the series of landings in force upon the European Continent has taken place.
Churchill	0	In this case the liberating assault fell upon the coast of France.
Churchill	0	An immense armada of upwards of 4,000 ships, together with several thousand smaller craft, crossed the Channel.
Churchill	0	Massed airborne landings have been successfully effected behind the enemy lines, and landings on the beaches are proceeding at various points at the present time.
Churchill	0	The fire of the shore batteries has been largely quelled.
Churchill	0	The obstacles that were constructed in the sea have not proved so difficult as was apprehended.
Churchill	0	The Anglo-American Allies are sustained by about 11,000 firstline aircraft, which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle.
Churchill	0	I cannot, of course, commit myself to any particular details.
Churchill	0	Reports are coming in in rapid succession.
Churchill	0	So far the Commanders who are engaged report that everything is proceeding according to plan.
Churchill	0	And what a plan!
Churchill	0	This vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever taken place.
Churchill	0	It involves tides, wind, waves, visibility, both from the air and the sea standpoint, and the combined employment of land, air and sea forces in the highest degree of intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and cannot be fully foreseen.There are already hopes that actual tactical surprise has been attained, and we hope to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises during the course of the fighting.
Churchill	0	The battle that has now begun will grow constantly in scale and in intensity for many weeks to come, and I shall not attempt to speculate upon its course.
Churchill	0	This I may say, however.
Churchill	0	Complete unity prevails throughout the Allied Armies.
Churchill	0	There is a brotherhood in arms between us and our friends of the United States.
Churchill	0	There is complete confidence in the supreme commander, General Eisenhower, and his lieutenants, and als6 in the commander of the Expeditionary Force, General Montgomery.
Churchill	0	The ardour and spirit of the troops, as I saw myself, embarking in these last few days was splendid to witness.
Churchill	0	Nothing that equipment, science or forethought could do has been neglected, and the whole process of opening this great new front will be pursued with the utmost resolution both by the commanders and by the United States and British Governments whom they serve.
Churchill	0	[Editor’s Note: Mr. Churchill added the following statement later in the day] : I have been at the centres where the latest information is received, and I can state to the House that this operation is proceeding in a thoroughly satisfactory manner.
Churchill	0	Many dangers and difficulties which at this time last night appeared extremely formidable are behind us.
Churchill	0	The passage of the sea has been made with far less loss than we apprehended.
Churchill	0	The resistance of the batteries has been greatly weakened by the bombing of the Air Force, and the superior bombardment of our ships quickly reduced their fire to dimensions which did not affect the problem.
Churchill	0	The landings of the troops on a broad front, both British and American- -Allied troops, I will not give lists of all the different nationalities they represent-but the landings along the whole front have been effective, and our troops have penetrated, in some cases, several miles inland.
Churchill	0	Lodgments exist on a broad front.The outstanding feature has been the landings of the airborne troops, which were on a scale far larger than anything that has been seen so far in the world.
Churchill	0	These landings took place with extremely little loss and with great accuracy.
Churchill	0	Particular anxiety attached to them, because the conditions of light prevailing in the very limited period of the dawn-just before the dawn-the conditions of visibility made all the difference.
Churchill	0	Indeed, there might have been something happening at the last minute which would have prevented airborne troops from playing their part.
Churchill	0	A very great degree of risk had to be taken in respect of the weather.But General Eisenhower’s courage is equal to all the necessary decisions that have to be taken in these extremely difficult and uncontrollable matters.
Churchill	0	The airborne troops are well established, and the landings and the follow-ups are all proceeding with much less loss-very much less-than we expected.
Churchill	0	Fighting is in progress at various points.
Churchill	0	We captured various bridges which were of importance, and which were not blown up.
Churchill	0	There is even fighting proceeding in the town of Caen, inland.
Churchill	0	But all this, although a very valuable first step-a vital and essential first step-gives no indication of what may be the course of the battle in the next days and weeks, because the enemy will now probably endeavour to concentrate on this area, and in that event heavy fighting will soon begin and will continue without end, as we can push troops in and he can bring other troops up.
Churchill	0	It is, therefore, a most serious time that we enter upon.
Churchill	0	Thank God, we enter upon it with our great Allies all in good heart and all in good friendship.
Churchill	0	Here Churchill sets out his trenchant view on the very characteristics of the House of Commons and on the planned rebuilding of the Chamber, destroyed by an enemy bomb on the night of 10 May 1941.
Churchill	0	By Winston S. Churchill
Churchill	0	Receiving the Freedom of the City of London.
Churchill	0	On 13 May Allied Forces completed their Northern African Campaigns, achieving total victory.
Churchill	0	Churchill commented in The Hinge of Fate: ‘The sense of victory was in the air.
Churchill	0	The whole of North Africa was cleared of the enemy.
Churchill	0	A quarter of a million prisoners were cooped in our cages.
Churchill	0	Everyone was very proud and delighted.
Churchill	0	There is no doubt that people like winning very much.’ On 16 May the Royal Air Force, in a brilliant raid deep into Germany, destroyed the Möhne and Eder dams, causing widespread flooding and destruction to the Ruhr Valley.
Churchill	0	It was under these auspicious circumstances that Churchill addressed the US Congress for the second time.
Churchill	0	April 9, 1963Declaration of Honorary Citizen of United States of AmericaBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATIONWHEREAS Sir Winston Churchill, a son of America though a subject of Britain, has been throughout his life a firm and steadfast friend of the American people and the American nation; andWHEREAS he has freely offered his hand and his faith in days of adversity as well as triumph; andWHEREAS his bravery, charity and valor, both in war and in peace, have been a flame of inspiration in freedom’s darkest hour; andWHEREAS his life has shown that no adversary can overcome, and no feat can deter, free men in the defense of their freedom; andWHEREAS he has by his art as an historian and his judgment as a statesman made the past the servant of the future;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOHN F. KENNEDY, President of the United States of America, under the authority contained in an Act of the 88th Congress, do hereby declare Sir Winston Churchill an honorary citizen of the United States of America.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh.JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDYWe meet to honor a man whose honor requires no meeting — for he is the most honored and honorable man to walk the stage of human history in the time in which we live.Whenever and wherever tyranny threatened, he has always championed liberty.Facing firmly toward the future, he has never forgotten the past.Serving six monarchs of his native Great Britain, he has served all men’s freedom and dignity.In the dark days and darker nights when Britain stood alone — and most men save Englishmen despaired of England’s life — he mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.
Churchill	0	The incandescent quality of his words illuminated the courage of his countrymen.Given unlimited powers by his citizens, he was ever vigilant to protect their rights.Indifferent himself to danger, he wept over the sorrows of others.A child of the House of Commons, he became in time its father.Accustomed to the hardships of battle, he has no distaste for pleasure.Now his stately Ship of Life, having weathered the severest storms of a troubled century, is anchored in tranquil waters, proof that courage and faith and the zest for freedom are truly indestructible.
Churchill	0	The record of his triumphant passage will inspire free hearts for all time.By adding his name to our rolls, we mean to honor him — but his acceptance honors us far more.
Churchill	0	For no statement or proclamation can enrich his name — the name Sir Winston Churchill is already legend.Mr.
Churchill	0	President,I have been informed by Mr. David Bruce that it is your intention to sign a Bill conferring upon me Honorary Citizenship of the United States.I have received many kindnesses from the United States of America, but the honour which you now accord me is without parallel.
Churchill	0	I accept it with deep gratitude and affection.I am also most sensible of the warm-hearted action of the individual States who accorded me the great compliment of their own honorary citizenships as a prelude to this Act of Congress.It is a remarkable comment on our affairs that the former Prime Minister of a great sovereign state should thus be received as an honorary citizen of another.
Churchill	0	I say “great sovereign state” with design and emphasis, for I reject the view that Britain and the Commonwealth should now be relegated to a tame and minor role in the world.
Churchill	0	Our past is the key to our future, which I firmly trust and believe will be no less fertile and glorious.
Churchill	0	Let no man underrate our energies, our potentialities and our abiding power for good.I am, as you know, half American by blood, and the story of my association with that mighty and benevolent nation goes back nearly ninety years to the day of my Father’s marriage.
Churchill	0	In this century of storm and tragedy I contemplate with high satisfaction the constant factor of the interwoven and upward progress of our peoples.
Churchill	0	Our comradeship and our brotherhood in war were unexampled.
Churchill	0	We stood together, and because of that fact the free world now stands.
Churchill	0	Nor has our partnership any exclusive nature: the Atlantic community is a dream that can well be fulfilled to the detriment of none and to the enduring benefit and honour of the great democracies.Mr.
Churchill	0	President, your action illuminates the theme of unity of the English-speaking peoples, to which I have devoted a large part of my life.
Churchill	0	I would ask you to accept yourself, and to convey to both Houses of Congress, and through them to the American people, my solemn and heartfelt thanks for this unique distinction, which will always be proudly remembered by my descendants.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL
Churchill	0	This was the last great speech made by Churchill in the House of Commons.
Churchill	0	It was listened to with deep respect and almost total silence in a packed Chamber.
Churchill	0	It contains the last of the remembered Churchill phrases “… safety will be the sturdy child of terror, and survival the twin brother of annihilation”.
Churchill	0	The two final sentences may be regarded as Churchill’s farewell to the House of Commons and to the British people.I beg to move, ‘That this House approves the Statement on Defence, 1955, Command Paper No.
Churchill	0	9391.’This Motion stands in my name, and it is supported by my right hon.
Churchill	0	Friends the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Minister of Defence.We live in a period, happily unique in human history, when the whole world is divided intellectually and to a large extent geographically between the creeds of Communist discipline and individual freedom, and when, at the same time, this mental and psychological division is accompanied by the possession by both sides of the obliterating weapons of the nuclear age.We have antagonisms now as deep as those of the Reformation and its reactions which led to the Thirty Years’ War.
Churchill	0	But now they are spread over the whole world instead of only over a small part of Europe.
Churchill	0	We have, to some extent, the geographical division of the Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century, only more ruthless and more thorough.
Churchill	0	We have force and science, hitherto the servants of man, now threatening to become his master.I am not pretending to have a solution for a permanent peace between the nations which could be unfolded this afternoon.
Churchill	0	We pray for it.
Churchill	0	Nor shall I try to discuss the cold war which we all detest, but have to endure.
Churchill	0	I shall only venture to offer to the House some observations mainly of a general character on which I have pondered long and which, I hope, may be tolerantly received, as they are intended by me.
Churchill	0	And here may I venture to make a personal digression?
Churchill	0	I do not pretend to be an expert or to have technical knowledge of this prodigious sphere of science.
Churchill	0	But in my long friendship with Lord Cherwell I have tried to follow and even predict the evolution of events.
Churchill	0	I hope that the House will not reprove me for vanity or conceit if I repeat what I wrote a quarter of a century ago:We know enough [I said] to be sure that the scientific achievements of the next fifty years will be far greater, more rapid and more surprising than those we have already experienced .
Churchill	0	.
Churchill	0	.
Churchill	0	High authorities tell us that new sources of power, vastly more important than any we yet know, will surely be discovered.
Churchill	0	Nuclear energy is incomparably greater than the molecular energy which we use to-day.
Churchill	0	The coal a man can get in a day can easily do 500 times as much work as the man himself.
Churchill	0	Nuclear energy is at least one million times more powerful still.
Churchill	0	If the hydrogen atoms in a pound of water could be prevailed upon to combine together and form helium, they would suffice to drive a 1,000 horse-power engine for a whole year.
Churchill	0	If the electrons those tiny planets of the atomic systems were induced to combine with the nuclei in the hydrogen, the horse-power liberated would be 120 times greater still.
Churchill	0	There is no question among scientists that this gigantic source of energy exists.
Churchill	0	What is lacking is the match to set the bonfire alight, or it may be the detonator to cause the dynamite to explode.This is no doubt not quite an accurate description of what has been discovered, but as it was published in the Strand Magazine of December, 1931- twenty-four years ago-I hope that my plea to have long taken an interest in the subject may be indulgently accepted by the House.What is the present position?
Churchill	0	Only three countries possess, in varying degrees, the knowledge and the power to make nuclear weapons.
Churchill	0	Of these, the United States is overwhelmingly the chief.
Churchill	0	Owing to the breakdown in the exchange of information between us and the United States since 1946 we have had to start again independently on our own.
Churchill	0	Fortunately, executive action was taken promptly by the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition to reduce as far as possible the delay in our nuclear development and production.
Churchill	0	By his initiative we have made our own atomic bombs.Confronted with the hydrogen bomb, I have tried to live up to the right hon.
Churchill	0	Gentleman’s standard.
Churchill	0	We have started to make that one, too.
Churchill	0	It is this grave decision which forms the core of the Defence Paper which we are discussing this afternoon.Although the Soviet stockpile of atomic bombs may be greater than that of Britain, British discoveries may well place us above them in fundamental science.May I say that for the sake of simplicity and to avoid verbal confusion I use the expression ‘atomic bombs’ and also ‘hydrogen bombs’ instead of ‘thermo-nuclear’ and I keep ‘nuclear’ for the whole lot.
Churchill	0	There is an immense gulf between the atomic and the hydrogen bomb.
Churchill	0	The atomic bomb, with all its terrors, did not carry us outside the scope of human control or manageable events in thought or action, in peace or war.
Churchill	0	But when Mr. Sterling Cole, the Chairman of the United States Congressional Committee, gave out a year ago – 17 February 1954 – the first comprehensive review of the hydrogen bomb, the entire foundation of human affairs was revolutionized, and mankind placed in a situation both measureless and laden with doom.It is now the fact that a quantity of plutonium, probably less than would fill the Box on the Table-it is quite a safe thing to store-would suffice to produce weapons which would give indisputable world domination to any great Power which was the only one to have it.
Churchill	0	There is no absolute defence against the hydrogen bomb, nor is any method in sight by which any nation, or any country, can be completely guaranteed against the devastating injury which even a score of them might inflict on wide regions.What ought we to do?
Churchill	0	Which way shall we turn to save our lives and the future of the world?
Churchill	0	It does not matter so much to old people; they are going soon anyway; but I find it poignant to look at youth in all its activity and ardour and, most of all, to watch little children playing their merry games, and wonder what would lie before them if God wearied of mankind.The best defence would of course be bona fide disarmament all round.
Churchill	0	This is in all our hearts.
Churchill	0	But sentiment must not cloud our vision.
Churchill	0	It is often said that ‘facts are stubborn things.’ A renewed session of a sub-committee of the Disarmament Commission is now sitting in London and is rightly attempting to conduct its debates in private.
Churchill	0	We must not conceal from ourselves the gulf between the Soviet Government and the N.A.T.O.
Churchill	0	Powers, which has hitherto, for so long, prevented an agreement.
Churchill	0	The long history and tradition of Russia makes it repugnant to the Soviet Government to accept any practical system of international inspection.A second difficulty lies in the circumstance that, just as the United States, on the one hand, has, we believe, the overwhelming mastery in nuclear weapons, so the Soviets and their Communist satellites have immense superiority in what are called ‘conventional’ forces-the sort of arms and forces with which we fought the last war, but much improved.
Churchill	0	The problem is, therefore, to devise a balanced and phased system of disarmament which at no period enables any one of the participants to enjoy an advantage which might endanger the security of the others.
Churchill	0	A scheme on these lines was submitted last year by Her Majesty’s Government and the French Government and was accepted by the late Mr. Vyshinsky as a basis of discussion.
Churchill	0	It is now being examined in London.If the Soviet Government have not at any time since the war shown much nervousness about the American possession of nuclear superiority, that is because they are quite sure that it will not be used against them aggressively, even in spite of many forms of provocation.
Churchill	0	On the other hand, the N.A.T.O.
Churchill	0	Powers have been combined together by the continued aggression and advance of Communism in Asia and in Europe.
Churchill	0	That this should have eclipsed in a few years, and largely effaced, the fearful antagonism and memories that Hitlerism created for the German people is an event without parallel.
Churchill	0	But it has, to a large extent, happened.
Churchill	0	There is widespread belief throughout the free world that, but for American nuclear superiority, Europe would already have been reduced to satellite status and the Iron Curtain would have reached the Atlantic and the Channel.Unless a trustworthy and universal agreement upon disarmament, conventional and nuclear alike, can be reached and an effective system of inspection is established and is actually working, there is only one sane policy for the free world in the next few years.
Churchill	0	That is what we call defence through deterrents.
Churchill	0	This we have already adopted and proclaimed.
Churchill	0	These deterrents may at any time become the parents of disarmament, provided that they deter.
Churchill	0	To make our contribution to the deterrent we must ourselves possess the most up-to-date nuclear weapons, and the means of delivering them.That is the position which the Government occupy.
Churchill	0	We are to discuss this not only as a matter of principle; there are many practical reasons which should be given.
Churchill	0	Should war come, which God forbid, there are a large number of targets that we and the Americans must be able to strike at once.
Churchill	0	There are scores of airfields from which the Soviets could launch attacks with hydrogen bombs as soon as they have the bombers to carry them.
Churchill	0	It is essential to our deterrent policy and to our survival to have, with our American allies, the strength and numbers to be able to paralyse these potential Communist assaults in the first few hours of the war, should it come.The House will perhaps note that I avoid using the word ‘Russia’ as much as possible in this discussion.
Churchill	0	I have a strong admiration for the Russian people -for their bravery, their many gifts, and their kindly nature.
Churchill	0	It is the Communist dictatorship and the declared ambition of the Communist Party and their proselytizing activities that we are bound to resist, and that is what makes this great world cleavage which I mentioned when I opened my remarks.There are also big administrative and industrial targets behind the Iron Curtain, and any effective deterrent policy must have the power to paralyse them all at the outset, or shortly after.
Churchill	0	There are also the Soviet submarine bases and other naval targets which will need early attention.
Churchill	0	Unless we make a contribution of our own-that is the point which I am pressing-we cannot be sure that in an emergency the resources of other Powers would be planned exactly as we would wish, or that the targets which would threaten us most would be given what we consider the necessary priority, or the deserved priority, in the first few hours.These targets might be of such cardinal importance that it would really be a matter of life and death for us.
Churchill	0	All this, I think, must be borne in mind in deciding our policy about the conventional forces, to which I will come later, the existing Services.Meanwhile, the United States has many times the nuclear power of Soviet Russia – I avoid any attempt to give exact figures and they have, of course, far more effective means of delivery.
Churchill	0	Our moral and military support of the United States and our possession of nuclear weapons of the highest quality and on an appreciable scale, together with their means of delivery, will greatly reinforce the deterrent power of the free world, and will strengthen our influence within the free world.
Churchill	0	That, at any rate, is the policy we have decided to pursue.
Churchill	0	That is what we are now doing, and I am thankful that it is endorsed by a mass of responsible opinion on both sides of the House, and, I believe, by the great majority of the nation.A vast quantity of information, some true, some exaggerated much out of proportion, has been published about the hydrogen bomb.
Churchill	0	The truth has inevitably been mingled with fiction, and I am glad to say that panic has not occurred.
Churchill	0	Panic would not necessarily make for peace.
Churchill	0	That is one reason why I have been most anxious that responsible discussions on this matter should not take place on the B.B.C.
Churchill	0	or upon the television, and I thought that I was justified in submitting that view of Her Majesty’s Government to the authorities, which they at once accepted-very willingly accepted.Panic would not necessarily make for peace even in this country.
Churchill	0	There are many countries where a certain wave of opinion may arise and swing so furiously into action that decisive steps may be taken from which there is no recall.
Churchill	0	As it is, the world population goes on its daily journey despite its sombre impression and earnest longing for relief.
Churchill	0	That is the way we are going on now.I shall content myself with saying about the power of this weapon, the hydrogen bomb, that apart from all the statements about blast and heat effects over increasingly wide areas there are now to be considered the consequences of “fall out” as it is called, of wind-borne radio-active particles.
Churchill	0	There is both an immediate direct el feet on human beings who are in the path of such a cloud and an indirect effect through animals, grass, and vegetables, which pass on these contagions to human beings through food.This would confront many who escaped the direct effects of the explosion with poisoning, or starvation, or both.
Churchill	0	Imagination stands appalled.
Churchill	0	There are, of course, the palliatives and precautions of a courageous Civil Defence, and about that the Home Secretary will be speaking later on to-night.
Churchill	0	But our best protection lies, as I am sure the House will be convinced, in successful deterrents operating from a foundation of sober, calm, and tireless vigilance.Moreover, a curious paradox has emerged.
Churchill	0	Let me put it simply.
Churchill	0	After a certain point has been passed it may be said.
Churchill	0	“The worse things get, the better”.The broad effect of the latest developments is to spread almost indefinitely and at least to a vast extent the area of mortal danger.
Churchill	0	This should certainly increase the deterrent upon Soviet Russia by putting her enormous spaces and scattered population on an equality or near-equality of vulnerability with our small densely populated island and with Western Europe.I cannot regard this development as adding to our dangers.
Churchill	0	We have reached the maximum already.
Churchill	0	On the contrary, to this form of attack continents are vulnerable as well as islands.
Churchill	0	Hitherto, crowded countries, as I have said, like the United Kingdom and Western Europe, have had this outstanding vulnerability to carry.
Churchill	0	But the hydrogen bomb, with its vast range of destruction and the even wider area of contamination, would be effective also against nations whose population, hitherto, has been so widely dispersed over large land areas as to make them feel that they were not in any danger at all.They, too, become highly vulnerable: not yet equally perhaps, but, still, highly and increasingly vulnerable.
Churchill	0	Here again we see the value of deterrents, immune against surprise and well understood by all persons on both sides I repeat “on both sides” who have the power to control events.
Churchill	0	That is why I have hoped for a long time for a top level conference where these matters could be put plainly and bluntly from one friendly visitor to the conference to another.Then it may well be that we shall by a process of sublime irony have reached a stage in this story where safety will be the sturdy child of terror, and survival the twin brother of annihilation.
Churchill	0	Although the Americans have developed weapons capable of producing all the effects I have mentioned, we believe that the Soviets so far have tested by explosion only a type of bomb of intermediate power.There is no reason why, however, they should not develop some time within the next four, three, or even two years more advanced weapons and full means to deliver them on North American targets.
Churchill	0	Indeed, there is every reason to believe that within that period they will.
Churchill	0	In trying to look ahead like this we must be careful ourselves to avoid the error of comparing the present state of our preparations with the stage which the Soviets may reach in three or four years’ time.
Churchill	0	It is a major error of thought to contrast the Soviet position three or four years hence with our own position to-day.
Churchill	0	It is a mistake to do this, either in the comparatively precise details of aircraft development or in the measureless sphere of nuclear weapons.The threat of hydrogen attack on these islands lies in the future.
Churchill	0	It is not with us now.
Churchill	0	According to the information that I have been able to obtain I have taken every opportunity to consult all the highest authorities at our disposal-the only country which is able to deliver to-day a full-scale nuclear attack with hydrogen bombs at a few hours’ notice is the United States.
Churchill	0	That surely is an important fact, and from some points of view and to some of us it is not entirely without comfort.It is conceivable that Soviet Russia, fearing a nuclear attack before she has caught up with the United States and created deterrents of her own, as she might argue that they are, might attempt to bridge the gulf by a surprise attack with such nuclear weapons as she has already.
Churchill	0	American superiority in nuclear weapons, reinforced by Britain, must, therefore, be so organized as to make it clear that no such surprise attack would prevent immediate retaliation on a far larger scale.
Churchill	0	This is an essential of the deterrent policy.For this purpose, not only must the nuclear superiority of the Western Powers be stimulated in every possible way, but their means of delivery of bombs must be expanded, improved, and varied.
Churchill	0	It is even probable, though we have not been told about it outside the N.A.T.O.
Churchill	0	sphere, that a great deal of this has been already done by the United States.
Churchill	0	We should aid them in every possible way.
Churchill	0	I will not attempt to go into details, but it is known that bases have been and are being established in as many parts of the world as possible and that over all the rest the United States Strategic Air Force, which is in itself a deterrent of the highest order, is in ceaseless readiness.The Soviet Government probably knows, in general terms, of the policy that is being pursued, and of the present United States strength and our own growing addition to it.
Churchill	0	Thus, they should be convinced that a surprise attack could not exclude immediate retaliation.
Churchill	0	As one might say to them, ‘Although you might kill millions of our peoples, and cause widespread havoc by a surprise attack, we could, within a few hours of this outrage, certainly deliver several, indeed many times the weight of nuclear material which you have used, and continue retaliation on that same scale.’‘We have,’ we could say, ‘already hundreds of bases for attack from all angles and have made an intricate study of suitable targets.’ Thus, it seems to me with some experience of wartime talks, you might go to dinner and have a friendly evening.
Churchill	0	I should not be afraid to talk things over as far as they can be.
Churchill	0	This, and the hard facts, would make the deterrent effective.I must make one admission, and any admission is formidable.
Churchill	0	The deterrent does not cover the case of lunatics or dictators in the mood of Hitler when he found himself in his final dug-out.
Churchill	0	That is a blank.
Churchill	0	Happily, we may find methods of protecting ourselves, if we were all agreed, against that.All these considerations lead me to believe that, on a broad view, the Soviets would be ill-advised to embark on major aggression within the next three or four years.One must always consider the interests of other people when you are facing a particular situation.
Churchill	0	Their interests may be the only guide that is available.
Churchill	0	We may calculate, therefore, that world war will not break out within that time.
Churchill	0	If, at the end of that time, there should be a supreme conflict, the weapons which I have described this afternoon would be available to both sides, and it would be folly to suppose that they would not be used.
Churchill	0	Our precautionary dispositions and preparations must, therefore, be based on the assumption that, if war should come, these weapons would be used.I repeat, therefore, that during the next three or four years the free world should, and will, retain an overwhelming superiority in hydrogen weapons.
Churchill	0	During that period it is most unlikely that the Russians would deliberately embark on major war or attempt a surprise attack, either of which would bring down upon them at once a crushing weight of nuclear retaliation.
Churchill	0	In three or four years’ time, it may be even less, the scene will be changed.
Churchill	0	The Soviets will probably stand possessed of hydrogen bombs and the means of delivering them not only on the United Kingdom but also on North American targets.
Churchill	0	They may then have reached a stage, not indeed of parity with the United States and Britain but of what is called ‘saturation.’I must explain this term of art.
Churchill	0	‘Saturation’ in this connection means the point where, although one Power is stronger than the other, perhaps much stronger, both are capable of inflicting crippling or quasi-mortal injury on the other with what they have got.
Churchill	0	It does not follow, however, that the risk of war will then be greater.
Churchill	0	Indeed, it is arguable that it will be less, for both sides will then realize that global war would result in mutual annihilation.Major war of the future will differ, therefore, from anything we have known in the past in this one significant respect; that each side, at the outset, will suffer what it dreads the most, the loss of everything that it has ever known of.
Churchill	0	The deterrents will grow continually in value.
Churchill	0	In the past, an aggressor has been tempted by the hope of snatching an early advantage.
Churchill	0	In future, he may be deterred by the knowledge that the other side has the certain power to inflict swift, inescapable, and crushing retaliation.
Churchill	0	Of course, we should all agree that a world-wide international agreement on disarmament is the goal at which we should aim.
Churchill	0	The Western democracies disarmed themselves at the end of the war.
Churchill	0	The Soviet Government did not disarm, and the Western nations were forced to rearm, though only partially, after the Soviets and Communists had dominated all China and half Europe.
Churchill	0	That is the present position.
Churchill	0	It is easy, of course, for the Communists to say now, ‘Let us ban all nuclear weapons.’ Communist ascendancy in conventional weapons would then become overwhelming.
Churchill	0	That might bring peace, but only peace in the form of the subjugation of the Free World to the Communist system.I shall not detain the House very much longer, and I am sorry to be so long.
Churchill	0	The topic is very intricate.
Churchill	0	I am anxious to repeat and to emphasize the one word which is the theme of my remarks, namely, ‘Deterrent.’ That is the main theme.The hydrogen bomb has made an astounding incursion into the structure of our lives and thoughts.
Churchill	0	Its impact is prodigious and profound, but I do not agree with those who say, ‘Let us sweep away forthwith all our existing defence services and concentrate our energy and resources on nuclear weapons and their immediate ancillaries.’ The policy of the deterrent cannot rest on nuclear weapons alone.
Churchill	0	We must, together with our N.A.T.O.
Churchill	0	allies, maintain the defensive shield in Western Europe.Unless the N.A.T.O.
Churchill	0	powers had effective forces there on the ground and could make a front, there would be nothing to prevent piecemeal advance and encroachment by the Communists in this time of so-called peace.
Churchill	0	By successive infiltrations, the Communists could progressively undermine the security of Europe.
Churchill	0	Unless we were prepared to unleash a full-scale nuclear war as soon as some local incident occurs in some distant country, we must have conventional forces in readiness to deal with such situations as they arise.We must, therefore, honour our undertaking to maintain our contribution to the N.A.T.O.
Churchill	0	forces in Europe in time of peace.
Churchill	0	In war, this defensive shield would be of vital importance, for we must do our utmost to hold the Soviet and satellite forces at arms’ length in order to prevent short-range air and rocket attack on these islands.
Churchill	0	Thus, substantial strength in conventional forces has still a vital part to play in the policy of the deterrent.
Churchill	0	It is perhaps of even greater importance in the cold war.Though world war may be prevented by the deterrent power of nuclear weapons, the Communists may well resort to military action in furtherance of their policy of infiltration and encroachment in many parts of the world.
Churchill	0	There may well be limited wars on the Korean model, with limited objectives.
Churchill	0	We must be able to play our part in these, if called upon by the United Nations organization.
Churchill	0	In the conditions of to-day, this is also an aspect of our Commonwealth responsibility.
Churchill	0	We shall need substantial strength in conventional forces to fulfil our world-wide obligations in these days of uneasy peace and extreme bad temper.To sum up this part of the argument, of course, the development of nuclear weapons will affect the shape and organization of the Armed Forces and also of Civil Defence.
Churchill	0	We have entered a period of transition in which the past and the future will overlap.
Churchill	0	But it is an error to suppose that, because of these changes our traditional forces can be cast away or superseded.
Churchill	0	The tasks of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in this transition period are set forth with clarity in the Defence White Paper.
Churchill	0	The means by which these duties will be met are explained in more detail in the Departmental Papers which have been laid before the House by the three Service Ministers.No doubt, nothing is perfect; certainly, nothing is complete, but, considering that these arrangements have been made in the first year after the apparition of the hydrogen bomb, the far-seeing and progressive adaptability which is being displayed by all three Services is remarkable.
Churchill	0	[Hon.
Churchill	0	Members: ‘Oh.’] I understand that there is to be a Motion of censure.
Churchill	0	Well, certainly, nothing could be more worthy of censure than to try to use the inevitable administrative difficulties of the transitional stage as a utensil of party politics and would-be electioneering.
Churchill	0	I am not saying that anyone is doing it; we shall see when it comes to the vote.The future shape of Civil Defence is also indicated in broad outline in the Defence White Paper.
Churchill	0	This outline will be filled in as the preparation of the new plans proceeds, but the need for an effective system of Civil Defence is surely beyond dispute.
Churchill	0	It presents itself to-day in its noblest aspect, namely, the Christian duty of helping fellow-mortals in distress.
Churchill	0	Rescue, salvage, and ambulance work have always been the core of Civil Defence, and no city, no family nor any honourable man or woman can repudiate this duty and accept from others help which they are not prepared to fit themselves to render in return.
Churchill	0	If war comes, great numbers may be relieved of their duty by death, but none must deny it as long as they live.
Churchill	0	If they do, they might perhaps be put in what is called ‘Coventry.’ [Laughter.]
Churchill	0	I am speaking of the tradition, and not of any particular locality.The argument which I have been endeavouring to unfold and consolidate gives us in this island an interlude.
Churchill	0	Let us not waste it.
Churchill	0	Let us hope we shall use it to augment or at least to prolong our security and that of mankind.
Churchill	0	But how?
Churchill	0	There are those who believe, or at any rate say, ‘If we have the protection of the overwhelmingly powerful United States, we need not make the hydrogen bomb for ourselves or build a fleet of bombers for its delivery.
Churchill	0	We can leave that to our friends across the ocean.
Churchill	0	Our contribution should be criticism of any unwise policy into which they may drift or plunge.
Churchill	0	We should throw our hearts and consciences into that.’Personally, I cannot feel that we should have much influence over their policy or actions, wise or unwise, while we are largely dependent, as we are to-day, upon their protection.
Churchill	0	We, too, must possess substantial deterrent power of our own.
Churchill	0	We must also never allow, above all, I hold, the growing sense of unity and brotherhood between the United Kingdom and the United States and throughout the English-speaking world to be injured or retarded.
Churchill	0	Its maintenance, its stimulation, and its fortifying is one of the first duties of every person who wishes to see peace in the world and wishes to see the survival of this country.To conclude: mercifully, there is time and hope if we combine patience and courage.
Churchill	0	All deterrents will improve and gain authority during the next ten years.
Churchill	0	By that time, the deterrent may well reach its acme and reap its final reward.
Churchill	0	The day may dawn when fair play, love for one’s fellow-men, respect for justice and freedom, will enable tormented generations to march forth serene and triumphant from the hideous epoch in which we have to dwell.
Churchill	0	Meanwhile, never flinch, never weary, never despair.
Churchill	0	I must congratulate the Assembly upon the high level maintained during this debate.
Churchill	0	Not only have the speeches been full of thoughts which have their own particular value because they have been contributed from so many angles, but also there have been successful attempts at oratory which have triumphed over the acoustic conditions which, I must tell you, are none too good and which will, I trust, be subject to development, like all the rest of our proceedings.We are engaged in the process of creating a European unit in the world organization of the United Nations.
Churchill	0	I hope that we shall become one of several continental units which will form the pillars of the world instrument for maintaining security, and be the best guarantee of maintaining peace.
Churchill	0	I hope that in due course these continental units will be represented in the world organization collectively, rather than by individual States as in the present system, and that we shall be able to settle a great mass of our problems among ourselves in Europe before they are brought, or instead of them being brought, to the world council for decision.We are not in any way the rival of the world organization.
Churchill	0	We are a subordinate but essential element in its ultimate structure.
Churchill	0	The progress of our first meeting has so far been encouraging.
Churchill	0	Our relations with the Committee of Ministers show a desire on both sides to reach a working harmony.
Churchill	0	That should not be difficult if we recognize clearly what our respective functions are.We are a deliberative Assembly, and we must have full freedom of discussion on all questions except defence.
Churchill	0	We must assert our right to this freedom and we must have our own Parliamentary officers to assist us in our debates.
Churchill	0	I trust that the necessary Amendments to the Statute will be made by the Committee of Ministers on this point as the result of our first session here at Strasbourg.But while I feel that we should insist upon full freedom of debate, and choice of subjects, we do not possess executive power, and at this stage in our development we could not possibly claim it.
Churchill	0	Our foundation by selection by the Governments of the day from the various parliaments is not such as to give us authority at this stage to take decisions.
Churchill	0	We claim, however, to make proposals.
Churchill	0	It is not for us to make decisions which would require executive authority.
Churchill	0	We may discuss European problems and try to bring about a sense of unity.
Churchill	0	We must feel our way forward and, by our good sense, build up an increasing strength and reputation.But we must not attempt on our present electoral basis to change the powers which belong to the duly constituted national parliaments founded directly upon universal suffrage.
Churchill	0	Such a course would be premature.
Churchill	0	It would be detrimental to our long-term interests.
Churchill	0	We should, however, do our utmost to secure that these national parliaments examine and let us know their views upon any recommendation on European problems that we may make.
Churchill	0	That, I think, we may require of them.
Churchill	0	Each of us, in our respective parliaments, should take the opportunity to raise points according to the procedure which prevails.I touch upon some of the points which are upon our agenda.
Churchill	0	I am not myself committed to a federal or any other particular solution at this stage.
Churchill	0	We must thoroughly explore all the various possibilities, and a committee, working coolly and without haste, should, in a few months, be able to show the practical steps which would be most helpful to us.
Churchill	0	I will not prejudge the work of the committee, but I hope they will remember Napoleon’s saying: ‘A constitution must be short and obscure.’Until that committee reports.
Churchill	0	I think we should be well advised to reserve our judgment.
Churchill	0	I am in accord with what Mr. Morrison has said on this subject.
Churchill	0	I share his view that we would be wise to see what are the recommendations of our committee which.
Churchill	0	I hope, will sit permanently and not be broken up by our departure.
Churchill	0	To take a homely and familiar test, we may just as well see what the girl looks like before we marry her.
Churchill	0	It is to our advantage to have an opportunity of making a detailed examination of these problems.Then there is the question of human rights, which is the second subject set down on our agenda.
Churchill	0	We attach great importance to this, Mr. President, and are glad that the obstacles to discussion by the Assembly have now been removed by the Committee of Ministers.
Churchill	0	A European Assembly forbidden to discuss human rights would indeed have been a ludicrous proposition to put to the world.Again.
Churchill	0	I should like to see the report of the committee on this subject before we put forward our proposals to the Committee of Ministers.
Churchill	0	There is an urgency about this, because once the foundation of human rights is agreed on the lines of the decisions of the United Nations at Geneva but I trust in much shorter form we hope that a European Court might be set up, before which cases of violation of these rights in our own body of twelve nations might be brought to the judgment of the civilized world.
Churchill	0	Such a court, of course, would have no sanctions and would depend for the enforcement of its judgments on the individual decisions of the States now banded together in this Council of Europe.
Churchill	0	But these States would have subscribed beforehand to the process, and I have no doubt that the great body of public opinion in all these countries would press for action in accordance with the freely given decision.I now come to the question of the empty seats, which was put before us by M. Andre Philip.
Churchill	0	Ten ancient capitals of Europe are behind the Iron Curtain.
Churchill	0	A large part of this continent is held in bondage.
Churchill	0	They have escaped from Nazism only to fall into the other extreme of Communism.
Churchill	0	It is like making a long and agonizing journey to leave the North Pole only to find out that, as a result, you have woken up in the South Pole.
Churchill	0	All around are only ice and snow and bitter piercing winds.We should certainly make some provision for association with representatives of these countries, who are deprived of ordinary democratic freedom but who will surely regain it in the long march of time.
Churchill	0	This is a matter which should be carefully considered by the Assembly, and I agree with all those, and there are many, who have spoken in favour of setting aside some seats in the Assembly as a symbol of proof of our intention that the Assembly shall some day represent all Europe, or all Europe west of the Curzon Line.I now come, sir, to the greatest and most important of all the questions that are before us.
Churchill	0	A united Europe cannot live without the help and strength of Germany.
Churchill	0	This has always been foreseen by the European Movement to whose exertions our presence here is due.
Churchill	0	At The Hague, fourteen months ago, where we resolved to press for the formation of this Assembly, a German delegation was present and was welcomed by all, especially by the representatives of France.
Churchill	0	One of the most practical reasons for pressing forward with the creation of a European Assembly was that it provided an effective means, and possibly the only effective means, of associating a democratic and free Germany with the Western democracies.It is too early to judge the results of the German election; but so far as we can yet appreciate the results, many of us, apart from party considerations, may have felt encouraged by the evident size and validity of the poll and by the general results.
Churchill	0	We cannot part at the end of this month on the basis that we do nothing more to bring Germany into our circle until a year has passed.
Churchill	0	That year is too precious to lose.
Churchill	0	If lost, it might be lost for ever.
Churchill	0	It might not be a year, but it might be the year.On the other hand, I am assured and here I must break the rule which Mr. Harold Macinillan laid down this morning, that the word ‘impossible’ must never be used again that it is physically impossible for any German Government that may emerge in the next few weeks to be represented here before we separate.I need scarcely say that I should be very glad if a way could be found.
Churchill	0	If, however, this cannot be found, then we must draw the attention of the Committee of Ministers to Article 34 of the Statute, which says: ‘The Committee of Ministers may convoke an Extraordinary Session of the Consultative Assembly at such time and place as the Committee, with the concurrence of the President of the Assembly, shall decide.’ I think we must ask that an assurance shall be given to us before we separate that the Committee of Ministers will convoke an Extraordinary Session of the Consultative Assembly at the earliest suitable date.If we could be told that we should meet again for an Extraordinary Session under this Article 34 in December or in January.
Churchill	0	I personally should be content to leave the matter in the hands of the Committee of Ministers, and even to forgo our claim for a debate upon this subject at this juncture.
Churchill	0	I would ask that we should receive an assurance that an Extraordinary Session will be convened and I appeal to you.
Churchill	0	Mr.
Churchill	0	Vice-President, personally to place yourself in communication with M. Spaak and urge him to confer with the Committee of Ministers upon this subject, so that we may have an answer and know what course we should take in the limited number of days and weeks which are at our disposal.When we meet in the Extraordinary Session, if one is granted in December or January next, it is my hope that we shall find ourselves already joined by a German delegation similar to that of other Member States; but if this cannot be done, then will be the time for us to debate the issue in full freedom.Mr.
Churchill	0	Vice-President.
Churchill	0	I earnestly hope that an agreement on this matter may be reached along these lines, and that we may be informed of it as soon as possible.
Churchill	0	It would enable us to avoid various serious difficulties at the present moment and would, I think, give the best chance for the future development of the European Assembly, and the best chance of making sure that the peace of Europe will be given every opportunity to consolidate itself.
Churchill	0	Such an event as the arrival in our midst of a German delegation as a result of our work here this month would certainly crown our first Session with a solid and memorable achievement, and would have a highly beneficial result in the cause of world peace and European security.I have only ventured to deal with these particularly important practical points, and 1 have not attempted to speak of the sentimental and moral aspects of our work.
Churchill	0	I hope that we shall not put our trust in formulae or in machinery.
Churchill	0	There are plenty of formulae-“slogans” I think Mr. Morrison called them and, in spite of all the misfortunes which have occurred, there is still plenty of machinery in the political field.It is by the spirit that we shall establish our force, and it is by the growth and gathering of the united sentiment of Europeanism, vocal here and listened to all over the world, that we shall succeed in taking, not executive decisions, but in taking a leading and active part in the revival of the greatest of continents which has fallen into the worst of misery.
Churchill	0	I am honoured by your wish that I should take part in the discussions of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Churchill	0	We have suffered in Great Britain by the lack of colleges of University rank in which engineering and the allied subjects are taught.
Churchill	0	Industrial production depends on technology and it is because the Americans, like the prewar Germans, have realized this and created institutions for the advanced training of large numbers of high-grade engineers to translate the advances of pure science into industrial technique, that their output per head and consequent standard of life are so high.
Churchill	0	It is surprising that England, which was the first country to be industrialized, has nothing of comparable stature.
Churchill	0	If tonight I strike other notes than those of material progress, it implies no want of admiration for all the work you have done and are doing.
Churchill	0	My aim, like yours, is to be guided by balance and proportion.The outstanding feature of the Twentieth Century has been the enormous expansion in the numbers who are given the opportunity to share in the larger and more varied life which in previous periods was reserved for the few and for the very few.
Churchill	0	This process must continue and we trust at an increasing rate.
Churchill	0	If we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance, it can only be by the tireless improvement of all our means of technical production, and by the diffusion in every form of education of an improved quality to scores of millions of men and women.
Churchill	0	Even in this darkling hour I have faith that this will go on.I rejoice in Tennyson’s lines:-“Men, my brothers, men, the workers, even reaping something new;That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do.”I was however a little disquieted that you find it necessary to debate the question, to quote Dr. Burchard’s opening address, “Whether the problem of world production yielding at least a minimum living to the whole population can be solved, and whether man has so destroyed the resources of his world that he may be doomed to die of starvation.” If, with all the resources of modern science, we find ourselves unable to avert world famine, we shall all be to blame, but a peculiar responsibility would rest upon the scientists.
Churchill	0	I do not believe they will fail, but if they do, or were not allowed to succeed, the consequences would be very unpleasant because it is certain that mankind would not agree to starve equally, and there might be some very sharp disagreements about how the last crust was to be shared.
Churchill	0	This would simplify our problem in an unduly primordial manner.I was so glad that in the first instance you asked me to talk about the past rather than to peer into the future because I know more about the past than I do about the future, and I was well content that the President of the United States, whose gift of prophecy was so remarkably vindicated by recent electoral results, should have accepted that task.
Churchill	0	We all regret that his heavy state duties prevent him from being here tonight.
Churchill	0	I shall therefore presently have to do a little of the peering myself.For us in Britain the Nineteenth Century ended amid the glories of the Victorian era, and we entered upon the dawn of the Twentieth in high hope for our country, our Empire and the world.
Churchill	0	The latter and larger part of the Nineteenth Century had been the period of liberal advance (liberal with a small ‘l’ please).
Churchill	0	In 1900 a sense of moving hopefully forward to brighter, broader and easier days was predominant.
Churchill	0	Little did we guess that what has been called the Century of the Common Man would witness as its outstanding feature more common men killing each other with greater facilities than any other five centuries together in the history of the world.
Churchill	0	But we entered this terrible Twentieth Century with confidence.
Churchill	0	We thought that with improving transportation nations would get to know each other better.
Churchill	0	We believed that as they got to know each other better they would like each other more, and that national rivalries would fade in a growing international consciousness.
Churchill	0	We took it almost for granted that science would confer continual boons and blessings upon us, would give us better meals, better garments and better dwellings for less trouble, and thus steadily shorten the hours of labour and leave more time for play, and culture.
Churchill	0	In the name of ordered but unceasing progress, we saluted the Age of Democracy expressing itself ever more widely through Parliaments freely and fairly elected on a broad or universal franchise.
Churchill	0	We saw no reason why men and women should not shape their own home life and careers without being cramped by the growing complexity of the State, which was to be their servant and the protector of their rights.
Churchill	0	You had the famous American maxim “Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,” and we both noticed that the world was divided into peoples that owned the Governments and Governments that owned the peoples.
Churchill	0	At least I heard all this around that time and liked some of it very much.I was a Minister in the British Liberal Government (large “L” please), returned with a great majority in 1906.
Churchill	0	That new Liberal Government arrived in power with much of its message already delivered and most of its aims already achieved.
Churchill	0	The days of hereditary aristocratic privilege were ended or numbered.
Churchill	0	The path was opened for talent in every field of endeavour.
Churchill	0	Primary education was compulsory, universal and free, or was about to become so.
Churchill	0	New problems arising from former successes awaited the new Administration.
Churchill	0	The independence of the proletariat from thralldom involved at least a minimum standard of life and labour and security for old age, sickness, and the death of the family breadwinner.
Churchill	0	It was to these tasks of social reform and insurance that we addressed ourselves.
Churchill	0	The name of Lloyd George will ever be associated in Great Britain with this new departure.
Churchill	0	I am proud to have been his Lieutenant in this work and also as a Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer and later as head of the wartime National Coalition to have carried these same themes further forward on a magnified scale.Science presently placed novel and dangerous facilities in the hands of the most powerful countries.
Churchill	0	Humanity was informed that it could make machines that would fly through the air and vessels which could swim beneath the surface of the seas.
Churchill	0	The conquest of the air and the perfection of the art of flying fulfilled the dream which for thousands of years had glittered in human imagination.
Churchill	0	Certainly it was a marvellous and romantic event.
Churchill	0	Whether the bestowal of this gift upon an immature civilization composed of competing nations whose nationalism grew with every advance of democracy and who were as yet devoid of international organization, was a blessing or a curse has yet to be proved.
Churchill	0	On the whole I remain an optimist.
Churchill	0	For good or ill Air mastery is today the supreme expression of military power, and fleets and armies, however necessary, must accept a subordinate rank.
Churchill	0	This is a memorable milestone in the march of man.The submarine, to do it justice, has never made any claim to be a blessing or even a convenience.
Churchill	0	I well remember when it became an accomplished military fact of peculiar significance to the British Isles and the British Navy, there was a general belief even in the Admiralty where I presided, that no nation would ever be so wicked as to use these under-water vessels to sink merchantmen at sea.
Churchill	0	How could a submarine, it was asked, provide for the safety of the crews of the merchant ships it sank?
Churchill	0	Public opinion was shocked when old Admiral Fisher bluntly declared that this would be no bar to their being used by the new and growing German Navy in a most ruthless manner.
Churchill	0	His prediction was certainly not stultified by what was soon to happen.Here then we have these two novel and potent weapons placed in the hands of highly nationalized sovereign States in the early part of the Twentieth Century, and both of them dwell with us today for our future edification.A third unmeasured sphere opened to us as the years passed, which, for the sake of comprehensive brevity, I will describe as Radar.
Churchill	0	This Radar, with its innumerable variants and possibilities, has so far been the handmaiden of the air, but it has also been the enemy of the submarine and in alliance with the air may well prove its exterminator.In the first half of the Twentieth Century, fanned by the crimson wings of war, the conquest of the air affected profoundly human affairs.
Churchill	0	It made the globe seem much bigger to the mind and much smaller to the body.
Churchill	0	The human biped was able to travel about far more quickly.
Churchill	0	This greatly reduced the size of his estate, while at the same time creating an even keener sense of its exploitable value.
Churchill	0	In the Nineteenth Century Jules Verne wrote “Round the World in Eighty Days.” It seemed a prodigy.
Churchill	0	Now you can get round it in four; but you do not see much of it on the way.
Churchill	0	The whole prospect and outlook of mankind grew immeasurably larger, and the multiplication of ideas also proceeded at an incredible rate.
Churchill	0	This vast expansion was unhappily not accompanied by any noticeable advance in the stature of man, either in his mental faculties, or his moral character.
Churchill	0	His brain got no better, but it buzzed more.
Churchill	0	The scale of events around him assumed gigantic proportions while he remained about the same size.By comparison therefore he actually became much smaller.
Churchill	0	We no longer had great men directing manageable affairs.
Churchill	0	The need was to discipline an array of gigantic and turbulent facts.
Churchill	0	To this task we have certainly so far proved unequal.
Churchill	0	Science bestowed immense new powers on man and at the same time created conditions which were largely beyond his comprehension and still more beyond his control.
Churchill	0	While he nursed the illusion of growing mastery and exulted in his new trappings, he became the sport and presently the victim of tides, and currents, of whirlpools and tornadoes amid which he was far more helpless than he had been for a long time.Hopeful developments in many directions were proceeding in 1914 on both sides of the Atlantic and seemed to point to an age of Peace and Plenty when suddenly violent events broke in upon them.
Churchill	0	For more than forty years there had been no major war in Europe.
Churchill	0	Indeed since the Civil War in the United States, there had been no great struggle in the West.
Churchill	0	A spirit of adventure stirred the minds of men and was by no means allayed by the general advance of prosperity and science.
Churchill	0	On the contrary prosperity meant power, and science offered weapons.
Churchill	0	We read in the Bible “Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked.” For several generations Britannia had ruled the waves – for long periods at less cost annually than that of a single modern battleship.History, will say that this great trust was not abused.
Churchill	0	American testimony about the early period of the Monroe Doctrine is upon record.
Churchill	0	There was the suppression of the Slave Trade.
Churchill	0	During our prolonged period of naval supremacy undeterred by the rise of foreign tariffs, we opened our ports freely to the commerce of the world.
Churchill	0	Our Colonial and oriental empire, even our coastal trade, was free to the shipping of all the nations on equal terms.
Churchill	0	We in no way sought to obstruct the rise of other States or Navies.
Churchill	0	For nearly the whole of the Nineteenth Century the monopoly of sea power in British hands was a trust discharged faithfully in the general interest.
Churchill	0	But now in the first decade of the Twentieth Century with new patterns of warships, naval rivalries became acute and fierce.
Churchill	0	Civilized Governments began to think in Dreadnoughts.
Churchill	0	It would in such a setting have been very difficult to prevent the First World War.There was of course one way – one way then as now – the creation of an international instrument, strong enough to adjust the disputes of nations and enforce its decisions against an aggressor.
Churchill	0	Much wisdom, eloquence and earnest effort was devoted to this theme in which the United States took the lead, but we only got as far as the World Court at the Hague and improvements in the Geneva Convention.
Churchill	0	The impulses towards a trial of strength in Europe were the stronger.
Churchill	0	Germany, demanding her ‘place in the sun’, was faced by a resolute France with her military honour to regain.
Churchill	0	England, in accordance with her foreign policy of three hundred years, sustained the weaker side.
Churchill	0	France found an ally in the Russia of the Czars and Germany in the crumbling Empire of the Hapsburgs.
Churchill	0	The United States, for reasons which were natural and traditional, but no longer so valid as in the past, stood aloof and expected to be able to watch as a spectator, the thrilling, fearful drama unfold from across what was then called “the broad Atlantic.” These expectations were not borne out by what happened.High hopes and spacious opportunities awaited the victorious allies when they assembled at Versailles after four and a half years of hideous mechanical slaughter, illuminated by infinite sacrifice, but not remarkably relieved by strategy or generalship.
Churchill	0	War, stripped of every pretention of glamour or romance had been brought home to the masses of the peoples in forms never before experienced except by the defeated.
Churchill	0	To stop another war was the supreme object and duty of the statesmen who met as friends and allies around the Peace Table.
Churchill	0	They made great errors.
Churchill	0	The doctrine of self-determination was not the remedy for Europe, which needed above all things, unity and larger groupings.
Churchill	0	The idea that the vanquished could pay the expenses of the victors was a destructive and crazy delusion.
Churchill	0	The failure to strangle Bolshevism at its birth and to bring Russia, then prostrate, by one means or another, into the general democratic system lies heavy upon us today.
Churchill	0	Nevertheless the statesmen at Versailles, largely at the inspiration of President Wilson, an inspiration implemented effectively by British thought, created the League of Nations.
Churchill	0	This is their defense before history, and had the League been resolutely sustained and used, it would have saved us all.This was not to be.
Churchill	0	Another ordeal even more appalling than the first lay before us.
Churchill	0	Even when so much else had failed we could have obtained a prolonged peace, lasting all our lives at least, simply by keeping Germany disarmed in accordance with the Treaty, and by treating her with justice and magnanimity.
Churchill	0	This latter condition was very nearly achieved at Locarno in 1928, but the failure to enforce the disarmament clauses and above all to sustain the League of Nations, both of which purposes could easily have been accomplished, brought upon us the Second World War.
Churchill	0	Once again the English speaking world gloriously but narrowly emerged, bleeding and breathless, but united as we never were before.
Churchill	0	This unity is our present salvation, because after all our victories, we are now faced by perils, both grave and near, and by problems more dire than have ever confronted Christian civilization, even in this Twentieth Century of storm and change.There remains however a key of deliverance.
Churchill	0	It is the same key which was searched for by those who laboured to set up the World Court at the Hague in the early years of the century.
Churchill	0	It is the same conception as animated President Wilson and his colleagues at Versailles, namely the creation of a world instrument capable at least of giving to all its members Security against Aggression.
Churchill	0	The United Nations Organization which has been erected under the inspiring leadership of my great wartime friend, President Roosevelt, in place of the former League, has so far been rent and distracted by the antagonism of Soviet Russia and by the fundamental schism which has opened between Communism and the rest of mankind.
Churchill	0	But we must not despair.
Churchill	0	We must persevere, and if the gulf continues to widen, we must make sure that the cause of Freedom is defended by all the resources of combined forethought and superior science.
Churchill	0	Here lies the best hope of averting a third world struggle, and a sure means of coming through it without being enslaved or destroyed.One of the questions which we are debating here is defined as “the failure of social and political institutions to keep pace with material and technical change.” Scientists should never underrate the deep-seated qualities of human nature and how, repressed in one direction they will certainly break out in another.
Churchill	0	The genus homo if I may display my Latin – is a tough creature who has travelled here by a very long road.
Churchill	0	His nature has been shaped and his virtues ingrained by many millions of years of struggle, fear and pain, and his spirit has, from the earliest dawn of history, shown itself upon occasion capable of mounting to the sublime, far above material conditions or mortal terrors.
Churchill	0	He still remains as Pope described him two hundred years ago:“Placed on this Isthmus of a middle StateA being darkly wise and rudely greatCreated half to rise and half to fallGreat Lord of all things, yet a prey to all.Sole Judge of truth in endless error hurled,The glory, jest and riddle of the world.”In his Introductory address, Dr. Burchard, the Dean of Humanities, spoke with awe of “an approaching scientific ability to control men’s thoughts with precision.” I shall be very content if my task in this world is done before that happens.
Churchill	0	Laws just or unjust may govern men’s actions.
Churchill	0	Tyrannies may restrain or regulate their words.
Churchill	0	The machinery of propaganda may pack their minds with falsehood and deny them truth for many generations of time.
Churchill	0	But the soul of man thus held in trance or frozen in a long night can be awakened by a spark coming from God knows where and in a moment the whole structure of lies and oppression is on trial for its life.
Churchill	0	Peoples in bondage should never despair.
Churchill	0	Science no doubt could if sufficiently perverted exterminate us all but it is not in the power of material forces in any period which the youngest here tonight need take into practical account, to alter the main elements in human nature or restrict the infinite variety of forms in which the soul and genius of the human race can and will express itself.How right you are in this great Institution of technical study and achievement to keep a Dean of Humanities and give him so commanding a part to play in your discussions!
Churchill	0	No technical knowledge can outweigh knowledge of the humanities in the gaining of which philosophy and history walk hand in hand.
Churchill	0	Our inheritance of well-founded slowly conceived codes of honour, morals and manners, the passionate convictions which so many hundreds of millions share together of the principles of freedom and justice, are far more precious to us than anything which scientific discoveries could bestow.
Churchill	0	Those whose minds are attracted or compelled to rigid and symmetrical systems of government should remember that logic, like science, must be the servant and not the master of man.
Churchill	0	Human beings and human societies are not structures that are built or machines that are forged.
Churchill	0	They are plants that grow and must be tended as such.
Churchill	0	Life is a test and this world a place of trial.
Churchill	0	Always the problems or it may be the same problem will be presented to every generation in different forms.
Churchill	0	The problems of victory may be even more baffling than those of defeat.
Churchill	0	However much the conditions change, the supreme question is how we live and grow and bloom and die, and how far each life conforms to standards which are not wholly related to space or time.Here I speak not only to those who enjoy the blessings and consolation of revealed religion but also to those who face the mysteries of human destiny alone.
Churchill	0	The flame of Christian ethics is still our highest guide.
Churchill	0	To guard and cherish it is our first interest, both spiritually and materially.
Churchill	0	The fulfilment of Spiritual duty in our daily life is vital to our survival.
Churchill	0	Only by bringing it into perfect application can we hope to solve for ourselves the problems of this world and not of this world alone.I cannot speak to you here tonight without expressing to the United States – as I have perhaps some right to do – the thanks of Britain and of Europe for the splendid part America is playing in the world.
Churchill	0	Many nations have risen to the summit of human affairs, but here is a great example where new-won supremacy has not been used for self-aggrandisement but only for further sacrifice.Three years ago I spoke at Fulton under the auspices of President Truman.
Churchill	0	Many people here and in my own country were startled and even shocked by what I said.
Churchill	0	But events have vindicated and fulfilled in much detail the warnings which I deemed it my duty to give at that time.Today there is a very different climate of opinion.
Churchill	0	I am in cordial accord with much that is being done.
Churchill	0	We have, as dominating facts, the famous Marshall Aid, the new unity in Western Europe and now the Atlantic Pact.
Churchill	0	How has this tremendous change in our outlook and policy been accomplished?
Churchill	0	The responsible Ministers in all the countries concerned deserve high credit.
Churchill	0	There is credit enough for all.
Churchill	0	In my own country the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Bevin, who has come here to sign the Atlantic Pact, has shown himself indifferent to mere party popularity in dealing with these great national issues.
Churchill	0	He has shown himself, like many American public men, above mere partisan interest in dealing with these national and world issues.
Churchill	0	No one could however have brought about these immense changes in the feeling of the United States, Great Britain and Europe but for the astounding policy of the Russian Soviet Government.
Churchill	0	We may well ask, “Why have they deliberately acted so as to unite the free world against them?” It is certainly not because there are not very able men among them.
Churchill	0	Why have they done it?
Churchill	0	I offer you my own answer to this strange conundrum.
Churchill	0	It is because they fear the friendship of the West more than its hostility.
Churchill	0	They cannot afford to allow free and friendly intercourse to grow up between the vast area they control and the civilization of the West.
Churchill	0	The Russian people must not see what goes on outside, and the world must not see what goes on inside the Soviet domain.
Churchill	0	Fourteen men in the Kremlin, holding down hundreds of millions of people and aiming at the rule of the world feel that at all costs they must keep up the barriers.
Churchill	0	Self-preservation, not for Russia but for themselves, lies at the root and is the explanation of their sinister and malignant policy.In consequence of the Soviet conduct the relations of Communist Russia with the other great powers of the world are without precedent in history.
Churchill	0	Measures and counter-measures have been taken on many occasions which in any previous period could only have meant armed conflict.
Churchill	0	The situation has been well described by distinguished Americans as the “cold war.” And the question is asked “Are we winning the cold war?” This cannot be decided by looking at Europe alone.
Churchill	0	We must also look to Asia.
Churchill	0	The worst disaster since our victory has been the collapse of China under Communist attack and intrigue.
Churchill	0	China, in which the United States have always taken a high interest, comprises an immense part of the population of the world.
Churchill	0	The absorption of China and India into the Kremlin-controlled Communist Empire, would certainly bring measureless bloodshed and misery to eight or nine hundred million people.On the other hand, the position in Europe has so far been successfully maintained.
Churchill	0	The prodigious effort of the Berlin Air Lift has carried us through the winter.
Churchill	0	Time, though dearly-bought, has been gained for peace.
Churchill	0	The efficiency of the American and British Air Forces has been proved and improved.
Churchill	0	Most of all the spectacle of the British and Americans trying to feed the two million Germans in Berlin, while the Soviet Government was trying to starve them, has been an object lesson to the German people far beyond anything that words could convey.
Churchill	0	I trust that small and needless provocations of German sentiment may be avoided by the Western Powers.
Churchill	0	The revival and union of Europe cannot be achieved without the earnest and freely given aid of the German people.The Air Lift has fully justified itself.
Churchill	0	Nevertheless, fear and its shadows brood over Western Europe today.
Churchill	0	A month ago in Brussels I spoke to a meeting of 30,000 Belgians.
Churchill	0	I could feel at once their friendship and their anxiety.
Churchill	0	They have no Atlantic Ocean, no English Channel, between them and the Russian Communist armoured divisions.
Churchill	0	Yet they bravely and ardently support the cause of United Europe.
Churchill	0	I was also conscious of the hope and faith which they, like the Greek people, place in the United States.We are now confronted with something quite as wicked but in some ways more formidable than Hitler, because Hitler had only the Herrenvolk pride and anti-Semitic hatred to exploit.
Churchill	0	He had no fundamental theme.
Churchill	0	But these fourteen men in the Kremlin have their hierarchy and a church of Communist adepts, whose missionaries are in every country as a Fifth Column, awaiting the day when they hope to be the absolute masters of their fellow-countrymen and pay off old scores.
Churchill	0	They have their anti-God religion and their Communist doctrine of the entire subjugation of the individual to the State.
Churchill	0	Behind this stands the largest Army in the world, in the hands of a Government pursuing Imperialist expansion, as no Czar or Kaiser had ever done.I must not conceal from you the truth as I see it.
Churchill	0	It is certain that Europe would have been communized and London under bombardment some time ago but for the deterrent of the Atomic Bomb in the hands of the United States.Another question is also asked.
Churchill	0	Is time on our side?
Churchill	0	That is not a question that can be answered except within strict limits.
Churchill	0	We have certainly not an unlimited period of time before a settlement should be achieved.
Churchill	0	The utmost vigilance should be practised but I do not think myself that violent or precipitate action should be taken now.
Churchill	0	War is not inevitable.
Churchill	0	The Germans have a wise saying, “The trees do not grow up to the sky.” Often something happens to turn or mitigate the course of events.
Churchill	0	Four or five hundred years ago Europe seemed about to be conquered by the Mongols.
Churchill	0	Two great battles were fought almost on the same day near Vienna and in Poland.
Churchill	0	In both of these the chivalry and armed power of Europe was completely shattered by the Asiatic hordes.
Churchill	0	It seemed that nothing could avert the doom of the famous Continent from which modern civilization and culture have spread throughout the world.
Churchill	0	But at the critical moment the Great Khan died.
Churchill	0	The succession was vacant, and the Mongol armies and their leaders trooped back on their ponies across the seven thousand miles which separated them from their capital in order to choose a successor.
Churchill	0	They never returned till now.We need not abandon hope or patience.
Churchill	0	Many favorable processes are on foot.
Churchill	0	Under the impact of Communism all the free nations are being welded together as they never have been before and never could be, but for the harsh external pressure to which they are being subjected.
Churchill	0	We have no hostility to the Russian people and no desire to deny them their legitimate rights and security.
Churchill	0	I hoped that Russia, after the war, would have access, through unfrozen waters, into every ocean, guaranteed by the World Organization of which she would be a leading member; that she should have the freest access, which indeed she has at the present time, to raw materials of every kind; and that the Russians everywhere would be received as brothers in the human family.
Churchill	0	That still remains our aim and ideal.
Churchill	0	We seek nothing from Russia but goodwill and fair play.
Churchill	0	If, however, there is to be a war of nerves, let us make sure our nerves are strong and are fortified by the deepest convictions of our hearts.
Churchill	0	If we persevere steadfastly together, and allow no appeasement of tyranny and wrong-doing in any form, it may not be our nerve or the structure of our civilization which will break, and peace may yet be preserved.This is a hard experience in the life of the world.
Churchill	0	After our great victory, which we believed would decide the struggle for freedom for our time at least, we thought we had deserved better of fortune.
Churchill	0	But unities and associations are being established by many nations throughout the free world with a speed and reality which would not have been achieved perhaps for generations.
Churchill	0	Of all these unities the one most precious to me is the fraternal association between the British Commonwealth of Nations and the United States.
Churchill	0	Do not underrate the strength of Britain.
Churchill	0	As I said at Fulton, “Do not suppose that half a century from now you will not see seventy or eighty millions of Britons spread about the world and united in defence of our traditions, our way of life, and the world causes which you and we espouse.” United we stand secure.Let us then move forward together in discharge of our mission and our duty, fearing God and nothing else.NOTE: This is the complete official text of Churchill’s speech released to the press by the MIT News Office: “For Release after 10:00 P.M.

Churchill	0	I am very glad to be invited to support the Prime Minister in calling for subscriptions to the British memorial to President Roosevelt.
Churchill	0	The House of Commons would gladly have voted all the money needed but it was thought better that the Fund should be made up by small subscriptions so that very large numbers of people could have a chance to take their share.
Churchill	0	In the great republic across the Atlanticthe head of the State is also the head of a Party, in the midst of all the controversies of partisan politics.
Churchill	0	But over here, in Britain, we only knew him as a world-statesman who was a friend in need and a friend indeed to our country and to the causes of freedom and civilisation which were our cause and which were his cause.For more than five years I worked with him in true comradeship.
Churchill	0	We sent each other, on each side, nearly a thousand long telegrams and so kept commanding unity of purpose and policy amid the innumerable perplexing problems of war, which in its intimacy and in its practical effectiveness surpassed any tale which history tells of the alliances of great nations with common aims and in equal peril.I conceived an admiration for President Roosevelt as a statesman, a man of affairs and a war leader.
Churchill	0	I felt the utmost confidence in his upright and inspiring character and outlook and these ripened in my breast a personal regard and affection for him which will dwell with me as long as I live.
Churchill	0	His love of his own country, his respect for its constitution, his power of gauging the tides and currents of its free, mobile, public opinion were manifest.
Churchill	0	But added to these were the beatings of that generous heart which was always stirred to anger and to action by spectacles of aggression and oppression by the strong against the weak.His physical affliction lay heavily upon him.
Churchill	0	It was a marvel that he bore up against it through all the years of Party controversy in his own country and through the years of world storm.
Churchill	0	As I said to the House of Commons not one man in ten millions, stricken and crippled as he was, would have attempted to plunge into a life of physical and mental exertion, of hard and ceaseless political strife.
Churchill	0	Not one in a generation would have succeeded in becoming undisputed master of the vast and tragic scene.There is no doubt that the late President foresaw the dangers closing in upon the pre-war world with far more prescience than most well-informed people on either side of the Atlantic.
Churchill	0	There never was a moment’s doubt on which side his sympathies lay.
Churchill	0	The bearing of the British nation in that time of stress when we were all alone filled him and vast numbers of his countrymen with the warmest sentiments towards our people.
Churchill	0	Even while the United States was nominally neutral he advised the extraordinary measure of assistance called “Lend-Lease”, which will stand forth as the most unselfish and unsordid financial act of any country in all known history.He was one of those men about whom one could feel that the worse things got, the better he would be.
Churchill	0	It is not for us in this island to appraise his position in American history, but we have a right to proclaim that he played a decisive part in the fortunes and the future of mankind, that he was the greatest American friend Britain has ever known and the most powerful champion of freedom who has ever brought help and comfort from the new world to the old.Now in war-scarred London we raise a monument to his memory and to his fame.
Churchill	0	It is the heartfelt tribute of British gratitude.
Churchill	0	To the pleasant ceremonial garden, with its fountains and trees and flowers, of which the Prime Minister has spoken, in which this monument will stand, all sorts and conditions of men and women will resort and if Franklin Roosevelt’s inspiration lingers there none will take away any thought which does not arouse fearless resistance to tyranny in all its forms and which does not harmonise with the broadening hopes and higher humanities which may some day reign over all the land and sea.
Churchill	0	What is this plight to which Europe has been reduced?
Churchill	0	Some of the smaller states have indeed made a good recovery, but over wide areas are a vast, quivering mass of tormented, hungry, careworn and bewildered human beings, who wait in the ruins of their cities and homes and scan the dark horizons for the approach of some new form of tyranny or terror.
Churchill	0	Among the victors there is a Babel of voices, among the vanquished the sullen silence of despair.
Churchill	0	That is all that Europeans, grouped in so many ancient states and nations, and that is all that the Germanic races have got by tearing each other to pieces and spreading havoc far and wide.
Churchill	0	Indeed, but for the fact that the great republic across the Atlantic realised that the ruin or enslavement of Europe would involve her own fate as well, and stretched out hands of succour and guidance, the Dark Ages would have returned in all their cruelty and squalor.
Churchill	0	They may still return.Yet all the while there is a remedy which, if it were generally and spontaneously adopted by the great majority of people in many lands, would as by a miracle transform the whole scene and would in a few years make all Europe, or the greater part of it, as free and happy as Switzerland is today.
Churchill	0	What is this sovereign remedy?
Churchill	0	It is to recreate the European fabric, or as much of it as we can, and to provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, safety and freedom.
Churchill	0	We must build a kind of United States of Europe.
Churchill	0	In this way only will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living.
Churchill	0	The process is simple.
Churchill	0	All that is needed is the resolve of hundreds of millions of men and women to do right instead of wrong and to gain as their reward blessing instead of cursing.Therefore I say to you “Let Europe arise!”Much work has been done upon this task by the exertions of the Pan-European Union, which owes so much to the famous French patriot and statesman Aristide Briand.
Churchill	0	There is also that immense body which was brought into being amidst high hopes after the First World War — the League of Nations.
Churchill	0	The League did not fail because of its principles or conceptions.
Churchill	0	It failed because those principles were deserted by those states which brought it into being, because the governments of those states feared to face the facts and act while time remained.
Churchill	0	This disaster must not be repeated.
Churchill	0	There is, therefore, much knowledge and material with which to build and also bitter, dearly bought experience to spur.There is no reason why a regional organisation of Europe should in any way conflict with the world organisation of the United Nations.
Churchill	0	On the contrary, I believe that the larger synthesis can only survive if it is founded upon broad natural groupings.
Churchill	0	There is already a natural grouping in the Western Hemisphere.
Churchill	0	We British have our own Commonwealth of Nations.
Churchill	0	These do not weaken, on the contrary they strengthen, the world organisation.
Churchill	0	They are in fact its main support.
Churchill	0	And why should there not be a European group which could give a sense of enlarged patriotism and common citizenship to the distracted peoples of this mighty continent?
Churchill	0	And why should it not take its rightful place with other great groupings and help to shape the honourable destiny of man?
Churchill	0	In order that this may be accomplished there must be an act of faith in which the millions of families speaking many languages must consciously take part.We all know that the two World Wars through which we have passed arose out of the vain passion of Germany to play a dominating part in the world.
Churchill	0	In this last struggle crimes and massacres have been committed for which there is no parallel since the Mongol invasion of the 13th century, no equal at any time in human history.
Churchill	0	The guilty must be punished.
Churchill	0	Germany must be deprived of the power to rearm and make another aggressive war.
Churchill	0	But when all this has been done, as it will be done, as it is being done, there must be an end to retribution.
Churchill	0	There must be what Mr Gladstone many years ago called a “blessed act of oblivion”.
Churchill	0	We must all turn our backs upon the horrors of the past and look to the future.
Churchill	0	We cannot afford to drag forward across the years to come hatreds and revenges which have sprung from the injuries of the past.
Churchill	0	If Europe is to be saved from infinite misery, and indeed from final doom, there must be this act of faith in the European family, this act of oblivion against all crimes and follies of the past.
Churchill	0	Can the peoples of Europe rise to the heights of the soul and of the instinct and spirit of man?
Churchill	0	If they could, the wrongs and injuries which have been inflicted would have been washed away on all sides by the miseries which have been endured.
Churchill	0	Is there any need for further floods of agony?
Churchill	0	Is the only lesson of history to be that mankind is unteachable?
Churchill	0	Let there be justice, mercy and freedom.
Churchill	0	The peoples have only to will it and all will achieve their heart’s desire.I am now going to say something that will astonish you.
Churchill	0	The first step in the re-creation of the European family must be a partnership between France and Germany.
Churchill	0	In this way only can France recover the moral and cultural leadership of Europe.
Churchill	0	There can be no revival of Europe without a spiritually great France and a spiritually great Germany.
Churchill	0	The structure of the United States of Europe will be such as to make the material strength of a single State less important.
Churchill	0	Small nations will count as much as large ones and gain their honour by a contribution to the common cause.
Churchill	0	The ancient States and principalities of Germany, freely joined for mutual convenience in a federal system, might take their individual places among the United States of Europe.But I must give you warning, time may be short.
Churchill	0	At present there is a breathing space.
Churchill	0	The cannons have ceased firing.
Churchill	0	The fighting has stopped.
Churchill	0	But the dangers have not stopped.
Churchill	0	If we are to form a United States of Europe, or whatever name it may take, we must begin now.
Churchill	0	In these present days we dwell strangely and precariously under the shield, and I even say protection, of the atomic bomb.
Churchill	0	The atomic bomb is still only in the hands of a nation which, we know, will never use it except in the cause of right and freedom, but it may well be that in a few years this awful agency of destruction will be widespread and that the catastrophe following from its use by several warring nations will not only bring to an end all that we call civilisation but may possibly disintegrate the globe itself.I now sum up the propositions which are before you.
Churchill	0	Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the United Nations Organisation.
Churchill	0	Under and within that world concept we must re-create the European family in a regional structure called, it may be, the United States of Europe, and the first practical step will be to form a Council of Europe.
Churchill	0	If at first all the States of Europe are not willing or able to join a union we must nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and who can.
Churchill	0	The salvation of the common people of every race and every land from war and servitude must be established on solid foundations, and must be created by the readiness of all men and women to die rather than to submit to tyranny.
Churchill	0	In this urgent work France and Germany must take the lead together.
Churchill	0	Great Britain, the British Commonwealth of Nations, mighty America — and, I trust, Soviet Russia, for then indeed all would be well — must be the friends and sponsors of the new Europe and must champion its right to live.
Churchill	0	Therefore I say to you “Let Europe arise!”
Churchill	0	Listen to the full speech from the BBC ArchivesThis speech may be regarded as the most important Churchill delivered as Leader of the Opposition (1945-1951).
Churchill	0	It contains certain phrases- “the special relationship,” “the sinews of peace ” – which at once entered into general use, and which have survived.
Churchill	0	But it is the passage on “the iron curtain” which attracted immediate international attention, and had incalculable impact upon public opinion in the United States and in Western Europe.
Churchill	0	Russian historians date the beginning of the Cold War from this speech.
Churchill	0	In its phraseology, in its intricate drawing together of several themes to an electrifying climax- this speech may be regarded as a technical classic.
Churchill	0	–Robert Rhodes JamesI am glad to come to Westminster College this afternoon, and am complimented that you should give me a degree.
Churchill	0	The name “Westminster” is somehow familiar to me.I seem to have heard of it before.
Churchill	0	Indeed, it was at Westminster that I received a very large part of my education in politics, dialectic, rhetoric, and one or two other things.
Churchill	0	In fact we have both been educated at the same, or similar, or, at any rate, kindred establishments.It is also an honour, perhaps almost unique, for a private visitor to be introduced to an academic audience by the President of the United States.
Churchill	0	Amid his heavy burdens, duties, and responsibilities-unsought but not recoiled from-the President has travelled a thousand miles to dignify and magnify our meeting here to-day and to give me an opportunity of addressing this kindred nation, as well as my own countrymen across the ocean, and perhaps some other countries too.
Churchill	0	The President has told you that it is his wish, as I am sure it is yours, that I should have full liberty to give my true and faithful counsel in these anxious and baffling times.
Churchill	0	I shall certainly avail myself of this freedom, and feel the more right to do so because any private ambitions I may have cherished in my younger days have been satisfied beyond my wildest dreams.
Churchill	0	Let me, however, make it clear that I have no official mission or status of any kind, and that I speak only for myself.
Churchill	0	There is nothing here but what you see.I can therefore allow my mind, with the experience of a lifetime, to play over the problems which beset us on the morrow of our absolute victory in arms, and to try to make sure with what strength I have that what has been gained with so much sacrifice and suffering shall be preserved for the future glory and safety of mankind.The United States stands at this time at the pinnacle of world power.
Churchill	0	It is a solemn moment for the American Democracy.
Churchill	0	For with primacy in power is also joined an awe inspiring accountability to the future.
Churchill	0	If you look around you, you must feel not only the sense of duty done but also you must feel anxiety lest you fall below the level of achievement.
Churchill	0	Opportunity is here now, clear and shining for both our countries.
Churchill	0	To reject it or ignore it or fritter it away will bring upon us all the long reproaches of the after-time.
Churchill	0	It is necessary that constancy of mind, persistency of purpose, and the grand simplicity of decision shall guide and rule the conduct of the English-speaking peoples in peace as they did in war.
Churchill	0	We must, and I believe we shall, prove ourselves equal to this severe requirement.When American military men approach some serious situation they are wont to write at the head of their directive the words “over-all strategic concept.” There is wisdom in this, as it leads to clarity of thought.
Churchill	0	What then is the over-all strategic concept which we should inscribe today?
Churchill	0	It is nothing less than the safety and welfare, the freedom and progress, of all the homes and families of all the men and women in all the lands.
Churchill	0	And here I speak particularly of the myriad cottage or apartment homes where the wage-earner strives amid the accidents and difficulties of life to guard his wife and children from privation and bring the family up in the fear of the Lord, or upon ethical conceptions which often play their potent part.To give security to these countless homes, they must be shielded from the two giant marauders, war and tyranny.
Churchill	0	We all know the frightful disturbances in which the ordinary family is plunged when the curse of war swoops down upon the bread-winner and those for whom he works and contrives.
Churchill	0	The awful ruin of Europe, with all its vanished glories, and of large parts of Asia glares us in the eyes.
Churchill	0	When the designs of wicked men or the aggressive urge of mighty States dissolve over large areas the frame of civilised society, humble folk are confronted with difficulties with which they cannot cope.
Churchill	0	For them all is distorted, all is broken, even ground to pulp.When I stand here this quiet afternoon I shudder to visualise what is actually happening to millions now and what is going to happen in this period when famine stalks the earth.
Churchill	0	None can compute what has been called “the unestimated sum of human pain.” Our supreme task and duty is to guard the homes of the common people from the horrors and miseries of another war.
Churchill	0	We are all agreed on that.Our American military colleagues, after having proclaimed their “over-all strategic concept” and computed available resources, always proceed to the next step-namely, the method.
Churchill	0	Here again there is widespread agreement.
Churchill	0	A world organisation has already been erected for the prime purpose of preventing war, UNO, the successor of the League of Nations, with the decisive addition of the United States and all that that means, is already at work.
Churchill	0	We must make sure that its work is fruitful, that it is a reality and not a sham, that it is a force for action, and not merely a frothing of words, that it is a true temple of peace in which the shields of many nations can some day be hung up, and not merely a cockpit in a Tower of Babel.
Churchill	0	Before we cast away the solid assurances of national armaments for self-preservation we must be certain that our temple is built, not upon shifting sands or quagmires, but upon the rock.
Churchill	0	Anyone can see with his eyes open that our path will be difficult and also long, but if we persevere together as we did in the two world wars-though not, alas, in the interval between them-I cannot doubt that we shall achieve our common purpose in the end.I have, however, a definite and practical proposal to make for action.
Churchill	0	Courts and magistrates may be set up but they cannot function without sheriffs and constables.
Churchill	0	The United Nations Organisation must immediately begin to be equipped with an international armed force.
Churchill	0	In such a matter we can only go step by step, but we must begin now.
Churchill	0	I propose that each of the Powers and States should be invited to delegate a certain number of air squadrons to the service of the world organisation.
Churchill	0	These squadrons would be trained and prepared in their own countries, but would move around in rotation from one country to another.
Churchill	0	They would wear the uniform of their own countries but with different badges.
Churchill	0	They would not be required to act against their own nation, but in other respects they would be directed by the world organisation.
Churchill	0	This might be started on a modest scale and would grow as confidence grew.
Churchill	0	I wished to see this done after the First World War, and I devoutly trust it may be done forthwith.It would nevertheless be wrong and imprudent to entrust the secret knowledge or experience of the atomic bomb, which the United States, Great Britain, and Canada now share, to the world organisation, while it is still in its infancy.
Churchill	0	It would be criminal madness to cast it adrift in this still agitated and un-united world.
Churchill	0	No one in any country has slept less well in their beds because this knowledge and the method and the raw materials to apply it, are at present largely retained in American hands.
Churchill	0	I do not believe we should all have slept so soundly had the positions been reversed and if some Communist or neo-Fascist State monopolised for the time being these dread agencies.
Churchill	0	The fear of them alone might easily have been used to enforce totalitarian systems upon the free democratic world, with consequences appalling to human imagination.
Churchill	0	God has willed that this shall not be and we have at least a breathing space to set our house in order before this peril has to be encountered: and even then, if no effort is spared, we should still possess So formidable a superiority as to impose effective deterrents upon its employment, or threat of employment, by others.
Churchill	0	Ultimately, when the essential brotherhood of man is truly embodied and expressed in a world organisation with all the necessary practical safeguards to make it effective, these powers would naturally be confided to that world organisation.Now I come to the second danger of these two marauders which threatens the cottage, the home, and the ordinary people-namely, tyranny.
Churchill	0	We cannot be blind to the fact that the liberties enjoyed by individual citizens throughout the British Empire are not valid in a considerable number of countries, some of which are very powerful.
Churchill	0	In these States control is enforced upon the common people by various kinds of all-embracing police governments.
Churchill	0	The power of the State is exercised without restraint, either by dictators or by compact oligarchies operating through a privileged party and a political police.
Churchill	0	It is not our duty at this time when difficulties are so numerous to interfere forcibly in the internal affairs of countries which we have not conquered in war.
Churchill	0	But we must never cease to proclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which are the joint inheritance of the English-speaking world and which through Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and the English common law find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence.All this means that the people of any country have the right, and should have the power by constitutional action, by free unfettered elections, with secret ballot, to choose or change the character or form of government under which they dwell; that freedom of speech and thought should reign; that courts of justice, independent of the executive, unbiased by any party, should administer laws which have received the broad assent of large majorities or are consecrated by time and custom.
Churchill	0	Here are the title deeds of freedom which should lie in every cottage home.
Churchill	0	Here is the message of the British and American peoples to mankind.
Churchill	0	Let us preach what we practise – let us practise what we preach.I have now stated the two great dangers which menace the homes of the people: War and Tyranny.
Churchill	0	I have not yet spoken of poverty and privation which are in many cases the prevailing anxiety.
Churchill	0	But if the dangers of war and tyranny are removed, there is no doubt that science and co-operation can bring in the next few years to the world, certainly in the next few decades newly taught in the sharpening school of war, an expansion of material well-being beyond anything that has yet occurred in human experience.
Churchill	0	Now, at this sad and breathless moment, we are plunged in the hunger and distress which are the aftermath of our stupendous struggle; but this will pass and may pass quickly, and there is no reason except human folly or sub-human crime which should deny to all the nations the inauguration and enjoyment of an age of plenty.
Churchill	0	I have often used words which I learned fifty years ago from a great Irish-American orator, a friend of mine, Mr. Bourke Cockran.
Churchill	0	“There is enough for all.
Churchill	0	The earth is a generous mother; she will provide in plentiful abundance food for all her children if they will but cultivate her soil in justice and in peace.” So far I feel that we are in full agreement.Now, while still pursuing the method of realising our overall strategic concept, I come to the crux of what I have travelled here to Say.
Churchill	0	Neither the sure prevention of war, nor the continuous rise of world organisation will be gained without what I have called the fraternal association of the English-speaking peoples.
Churchill	0	This means a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States.
Churchill	0	This is no time for generalities, and I will venture to be precise.
Churchill	0	Fraternal association requires not only the growing friendship and mutual understanding between our two vast but kindred Systems of society, but the continuance of the intimate relationship between our military advisers, leading to common study of potential dangers, the similarity of weapons and manuals of instructions, and to the interchange of officers and cadets at technical colleges.
Churchill	0	It should carry with it the continuance of the present facilities for mutual security by the joint use of all Naval and Air Force bases in the possession of either country all over the world.
Churchill	0	This would perhaps double the mobility of the American Navy and Air Force.
Churchill	0	It would greatly expand that of the British Empire Forces and it might well lead, if and as the world calms down, to important financial savings.
Churchill	0	Already we use together a large number of islands; more may well be entrusted to our joint care in the near future.The United States has already a Permanent Defence Agreement with the Do-minion of Canada, which is so devotedly attached to the British Commonwealth and Empire.
Churchill	0	This Agreement is more effective than many of those which have often been made under formal alliances.
Churchill	0	This principle should be extended to all British Commonwealths with full reciprocity.
Churchill	0	Thus, whatever happens, and thus only, shall we be secure ourselves and able to work together for the high and simple causes that are dear to us and bode no ill to any.
Churchill	0	Eventually there may come-I feel eventually there will come-the principle of common citizenship, but that we may be content to leave to destiny, whose outstretched arm many of us can already clearly see.There is however an important question we must ask ourselves.
Churchill	0	Would a special relationship between the United States and the British Commonwealth be inconsistent with our over-riding loyalties to the World Organisation?
Churchill	0	I reply that, on the contrary, it is probably the only means by which that organisation will achieve its full stature and strength.
Churchill	0	There are already the special United States relations with Canada which I have just mentioned, and there are the special relations between the United States and the South American Republics.
Churchill	0	We British have our twenty years Treaty of Collaboration and Mutual Assistance with Soviet Russia.
Churchill	0	I agree with Mr. Bevin, the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain, that it might well be a fifty years Treaty so far as we are concerned.
Churchill	0	We aim at nothing but mutual assistance and collaboration.
Churchill	0	The British have an alliance with Portugal unbroken since 1384, and which produced fruitful results at critical moments in the late war.
Churchill	0	None of these clash with the general interest of a world agreement, or a world organisation; on the contrary they help it.
Churchill	0	“In my father’s house are many mansions.” Special associations between members of the United Nations which have no aggressive point against any other country, which harbour no design incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations, far from being harmful, are beneficial and, as I believe, indispensable.I spoke earlier of the Temple of Peace.
Churchill	0	Workmen from all countries must build that temple.
Churchill	0	If two of the workmen know each other particularly well and are old friends, if their families are inter-mingled, and if they have “faith in each other’s purpose, hope in each other’s future and charity towards each other’s shortcomings”-to quote some good words I read here the other day-why cannot they work together at the common task as friends and partners?
Churchill	0	Why cannot they share their tools and thus increase each other’s working powers?
Churchill	0	Indeed they must do so or else the temple may not be built, or, being built, it may collapse, and we shall all be proved again unteachable and have to go and try to learn again for a third time in a school of war, incomparably more rigorous than that from which we have just been released.
Churchill	0	The dark ages may return, the Stone Age may return on the gleaming wings of science, and what might now shower immeasurable material blessings upon mankind, may even bring about its total destruction.
Churchill	0	Beware, I say; time may be short.
Churchill	0	Do not let us take the course of allowing events to drift along until it is too late.
Churchill	0	If there is to be a fraternal association of the kind I have described, with all the extra strength and security which both our countries can derive from it, let us make sure that that great fact is known to the world, and that it plays its part in steadying and stabilising the foundations of peace.
Churchill	0	There is the path of wisdom.
Churchill	0	Prevention is better than cure.A shadow has fallen upon the scenes so lately lighted by the Allied victory.
Churchill	0	Nobody knows what Soviet Russia and its Communist international organisation intends to do in the immediate future, or what are the limits, if any, to their expansive and proselytising tendencies.
Churchill	0	I have a strong admiration and regard for the valiant Russian people and for my wartime comrade, Marshal Stalin.
Churchill	0	There is deep sympathy and goodwill in Britain-and I doubt not here also-towards the peoples of all the Russias and a resolve to persevere through many differences and rebuffs in establishing lasting friendships.
Churchill	0	We understand the Russian need to be secure on her western frontiers by the removal of all possibility of German aggression.
Churchill	0	We welcome Russia to her rightful place among the leading nations of the world.
Churchill	0	We welcome her flag upon the seas.
Churchill	0	Above all, we welcome constant, frequent and growing contacts between the Russian people and our own people on both sides of the Atlantic.
Churchill	0	It is my duty however, for I am sure you would wish me to state the facts as I see them to you, to place before you certain facts about the present position in Europe.From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.
Churchill	0	Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe.
Churchill	0	Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and, in many cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow.
Churchill	0	Athens alone-Greece with its immortal glories-is free to decide its future at an election under British, American and French observation.
Churchill	0	The Russian-dominated Polish Government has been encouraged to make enormous and wrongful inroads upon Germany, and mass expulsions of millions of Germans on a scale grievous and undreamed-of are now taking place.
Churchill	0	The Communist parties, which were very small in all these Eastern States of Europe, have been raised to pre-eminence and power far beyond their numbers and are seeking everywhere to obtain totalitarian control.
Churchill	0	Police governments are prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy.Turkey and Persia are both profoundly alarmed and disturbed at the claims which are being made upon them and at the pressure being exerted by the Moscow Government.
Churchill	0	An attempt is being made by the Russians in Berlin to build up a quasi-Communist party in their zone of Occupied Germany by showing special favours to groups of left-wing German leaders.
Churchill	0	At the end of the fighting last June, the American and British Armies withdrew westwards, in accordance with an earlier agreement, to a depth at some points of 150 miles upon a front of nearly four hundred miles, in order to allow our Russian allies to occupy this vast expanse of territory which the Western Democracies had conquered.If now the Soviet Government tries, by separate action, to build up a pro-Communist Germany in their areas, this will cause new serious difficulties in the British and American zones, and will give the defeated Germans the power of putting themselves up to auction between the Soviets and the Western Democracies.
Churchill	0	Whatever conclusions may be drawn from these facts-and facts they are-this is certainly not the Liberated Europe we fought to build up.
Churchill	0	Nor is it one which contains the essentials of permanent peace.The safety of the world requires a new unity in Europe, from which no nation should be permanently outcast.
Churchill	0	It is from the quarrels of the strong parent races in Europe that the world wars we have witnessed, or which occurred in former times, have sprung.
Churchill	0	Twice in our own lifetime we have seen the United States, against their wishes and their traditions, against arguments, the force of which it is impossible not to comprehend, drawn by irresistible forces, into these wars in time to secure the victory of the good cause, but only after frightful slaughter and devastation had occurred.
Churchill	0	Twice the United States has had to send several millions of its young men across the Atlantic to find the war; but now war can find any nation, wherever it may dwell between dusk and dawn.
Churchill	0	Surely we should work with conscious purpose for a grand pacification of Europe, within the structure of the United Nations and in accordance with its Charter.
Churchill	0	That I feel is an open cause of policy of very great importance.In front of the iron curtain which lies across Europe are other causes for anxiety.
Churchill	0	In Italy the Communist Party is seriously hampered by having to Support the Communist-trained Marshal Tito’s claims to former Italian territory at the head of the Adriatic.
Churchill	0	Nevertheless the future of Italy hangs in the balance.
Churchill	0	Again one cannot imagine a regenerated Europe without a strong France.
Churchill	0	All my public life I have worked for a Strong France and I never lost faith in her destiny, even in the darkest hours.
Churchill	0	I will not lose faith now.
Churchill	0	However, in a great number of countries, far from the Russian frontiers and throughout the world, Communist fifth columns are established and work in complete unity and absolute obedience to the directions they receive from the Communist centre.
Churchill	0	Except in the British Commonwealth and in the United States where Communism is in its infancy, the Communist parties or fifth columns constitute a growing challenge and peril to Christian civilisation.
Churchill	0	These are sombre facts for anyone to have to recite on the morrow of a victory gained by so much splendid comradeship in arms and in the cause of freedom and democracy; but we should be most unwise not to face them squarely while time remains.The outlook is also anxious in the Far East and especially in Manchuria.
Churchill	0	The Agreement which was made at Yalta, to which I was a party, was extremely favourable to Soviet Russia, but it was made at a time when no one could say that the German war might not extend all through the summer and autumn of 1945 and when the Japanese war was expected to last for a further 18 months from the end of the German war.
Churchill	0	In this country you are all so well-informed about the Far East, and such devoted friends of China, that I do not need to expatiate on the situation there.I have felt bound to portray the shadow which, alike in the west and in the east, falls upon the world.
Churchill	0	I was a high minister at the time of the Versailles Treaty and a close friend of Mr. Lloyd-George, who was the head of the British delegation at Versailles.
Churchill	0	I did not myself agree with many things that were done, but I have a very Strong impression in my mind of that situation, and I find it painful to contrast it with that which prevails now.
Churchill	0	In those days there were high hopes and unbounded confidence that the wars were over, and that the League of Nations would become all-powerful.
Churchill	0	I do not see or feel that same confidence or even the same hopes in the haggard world at the present time.On the other hand I repulse the idea that a new war is inevitable; still more that it is imminent.
Churchill	0	It is because I am sure that our fortunes are still in our own hands and that we hold the power to save the future, that I feel the duty to speak out now that I have the occasion and the opportunity to do so.
Churchill	0	I do not believe that Soviet Russia desires war.
Churchill	0	What they desire is the fruits of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines.
Churchill	0	But what we have to consider here to-day while time remains, is the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of conditions of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries.
Churchill	0	Our difficulties and dangers will not be removed by closing our eyes to them.
Churchill	0	They will not be removed by mere waiting to see what happens; nor will they be removed by a policy of appeasement.
Churchill	0	What is needed is a settlement, and the longer this is delayed, the more difficult it will be and the greater our dangers will become.From what I have seen of our Russian friends and Allies during the war, I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for weakness, especially military weakness.
Churchill	0	For that reason the old doctrine of a balance of power is unsound.
Churchill	0	We cannot afford, if we can help it, to work on narrow margins, offering temptations to a trial of strength.
Churchill	0	If the Western Democracies stand together in strict adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter, their influence for furthering those principles will be immense and no one is likely to molest them.
Churchill	0	If however they become divided or falter in their duty and if these all-important years are allowed to slip away then indeed catastrophe may overwhelm us all.Last time I saw it all coming and cried aloud to my own fellow-countrymen and to the world, but no one paid any attention.
Churchill	0	Up till the year 1933 or even 1935, Germany might have been saved from the awful fate which has overtaken her and we might all have been spared the miseries Hitler let loose upon mankind.
Churchill	0	There never was a war in all history easier to prevent by timely action than the one which has just desolated such great areas of the globe.
Churchill	0	It could have been prevented in my belief without the firing of a single shot, and Germany might be powerful, prosperous and honoured to-day; but no one would listen and one by one we were all sucked into the awful whirlpool.
Churchill	0	We surely must not let that happen again.
Churchill	0	This can only be achieved by reaching now, in 1946, a good understanding on all points with Russia under the general authority of the United Nations Organisation and by the maintenance of that good understanding through many peaceful years, by the world instrument, supported by the whole strength of the English-speaking world and all its connections.
Churchill	0	There is the solution which I respectfully offer to you in this Address to which I have given the title “The Sinews of Peace.”Let no man underrate the abiding power of the British Empire and Commonwealth.
Churchill	0	Because you see the 46 millions in our island harassed about their food supply, of which they only grow one half, even in war-time, or because we have difficulty in restarting our industries and export trade after six years of passionate war effort, do not suppose that we shall not come through these dark years of privation as we have come through the glorious years of agony, or that half a century from now, you will not see 70 or 80 millions of Britons spread about the world and united in defence of our traditions, our way of life, and of the world causes which you and we espouse.
Churchill	0	If the population of the English-speaking Commonwealths be added to that of the United States with all that such co-operation implies in the air, on the sea, all over the globe and in science and in industry, and in moral force, there will be no quivering, precarious balance of power to offer its temptation to ambition or adventure.
Churchill	0	On the contrary, there will be an overwhelming assurance of security.
Churchill	0	If we adhere faithfully to the Charter of the United Nations and walk forward in sedate and sober strength seeking no one’s land or treasure, seeking to lay no arbitrary control upon the thoughts of men; if all British moral and material forces and convictions are joined with your own in fraternal association, the high-roads of the future will be clear, not only for us but for all, not only for our time, but for a century to come.© Chartwell Trust, Reprinted by kind permission of Curtis Brown, London.
Trump	1	"What would you like me to do?
Trump	1	They have lawyers, we have lawyers and what happens is then they go away and is supposed to come back for the trial.
Trump	1	It's a poll, but we love those polls.
Trump	1	So we can continue this incredible movement, we have to continue this great, great movement.
Trump	1	But everyone that reached me says hello, Mr. President, congratulations on what you've done for the economy.
Trump	1	Everyone said, it couldn't be passed, has not been able to be passed for 45 years, and we just got it passed, V.A.
Trump	1	So I take this number, and I put it on my desk, and I put it in the middle of a stack of papers.
Trump	1	You're the elite.
Trump	1	Where do you stop?
Trump	1	We'll have to come up with another name for her.
Trump	1	These are savage killers, and they should have been brought out a long time ago by the Obama administration.
Trump	1	We'd build a school, they'd blow it up.
Trump	1	We've given you certain advantages that you didn't have before this administration, but you have made it possible.
Trump	1	Did you see, when I campaigned, I was the only one that said we're not touching your Social Security?
Trump	1	[Laughter] Fifteen anonymous sources have said all sorts of stuff.
Trump	1	The Democrats also want to raid Medicare to fund benefits from so many different things, but they want to fund them for illegal immigrants, so the illegal immigrants come in.
Trump	1	It's not a very nice game.
Trump	1	Not good.
Trump	1	How bad was NAFTA?
Trump	1	[Laughter] You ever see it?
Trump	1	We will continue to work with friends and allies to deny radical Islamic terrorists any funding, territory or support, or any means of infiltrating our borders.
Trump	1	Not a lot of difference.
Trump	1	That was Mike Huckabee.
Trump	1	What we're doing, we're turning it around.
Trump	1	You saw that.
Trump	1	And thank you both for your courageous work.
Trump	1	You know, according to it, if you really go by that rule, every single building in New York would have to be ripped down and rebuilt as a different building, and they have buildings in New York, you wouldn't have windows, the building would be quite good, except you wouldn't have windows.
Trump	1	In my first year in office, the number of patients receiving medication-assisted treatment at community health centers increased by 64 percent.
Trump	1	And he's probably going to vote no.
Trump	1	They had a hard time with that one, but we have a big race tomorrow.
Trump	1	Let's just hope everything is fine.
Trump	1	A lot of things are surprising in life.
Trump	1	They have to pay the ultimate price.
Trump	1	And I'm not just talking about going to up to the moon and going to Mars.
Trump	1	And what's happened is, as you see, unemployment is way down, and people are starting to hire inmates.
Trump	1	And you win.
Trump	1	These are people that want a government that protects faith, family, and life.
Trump	1	We put tariffs on $250 billion worth of different things they send our country and inflation is staying low.
Trump	1	So I signed it up on Monday.
Trump	1	And finally, the person that we are here for tonight.
Trump	1	Jimmy Carter -- the peanut industry.
Trump	1	It doesn't matter.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Because you knew what I was about to say, but I didn't even say it.
Trump	1	I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning.
Trump	1	They're terminally ill!
Trump	1	Look.
Trump	1	[Laughter] So, I don't know who we're going to run against.
Trump	1	The more they rush, the worse it's going to be.
Trump	1	It's coming way down.
Trump	1	Just came up with a great healthcare plan.
Trump	1	We have a good time.
Trump	1	Stop catch and release.
Trump	1	The Bushes weren't -- everybody.
Trump	1	We are also joined this evening by the Speaker of the Michigan House Lee Chatfield.
Trump	1	He was probably five points down.
Trump	1	Hispanic-American unemployment is the lowest rate in history.
Trump	1	 Hello, Florida.
Trump	1	And just remember that name.
Trump	1	We can't afford to do that as a country.
Trump	1	Come on up here, Masa, if you can understand what I'm saying.
Trump	1	The Democratic Party, but you know, the real name is the Democrat Party.
Trump	1	And we did the right thing.
Trump	1	That's happening.
Trump	1	It was already Election Day.
Trump	1	A couple of polls came out today that were very good.
Trump	1	You see, Dan, with all of that paparazzi back -- this was just supposed to be a quick little signing, in and out -- they're going crazy when I introduce all you guys, because they end up saying, this is like a political event.
Trump	1	With your support, we will keep on cutting your taxes, reducing your regulations and raising your incomes.
Trump	1	Governor, we like winners.
Trump	1	But they said, sir, could we ask you one question?
Trump	1	He loves our military, loves our police, he loves our vets and he will always protect patients and he will always go for like me, and I say it so strongly because the fake news doesn't want to say it.
Trump	1	They want to make a deal.
Trump	1	They do nothing for us.
Trump	1	It seemed like four years would never happen and now we're a year and a half away less think of it.
Trump	1	And you know what else we did, which is I think really great, it's really something.
Trump	1	Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it.
Trump	1	Go do it immediately.
Trump	1	He co-sponsored legislation that provides late term abortion on demand.
Trump	1	It's got to be properly applied, but stop-and-frisk works.
Trump	1	And they're being liberated.
Trump	1	They've paid for it for a long time.
Trump	1	You know, their term that they use is, "resist."
Trump	1	The key is what it says.
Trump	1	There's only -- truly never been a better time, in my opinion, to build and break ground in America.
Trump	1	Do you think the people -- those are not signs made in the basement.
Trump	1	Also here today are Cris and Gary Peterson, and their son Ben and daughter-in-law Nicki.
Trump	1	We're going to win all over.
Trump	1	We need one more.
Trump	1	That's a big deal, so that people like Todd Young will never see the Senate again.
Trump	1	Todd Young's friend.
Trump	1	He said, I've never seen anything like it.
Trump	1	I think they got like a 97 percent shot at it.
Trump	1	Uh-huh.
Trump	1	And I guess, in terms of the house, we get a vote and we cut taxes massively, and these companies that are all moving back down.
Trump	1	And you got to keep the movement going tomorrow, because if we don't do reasonably well -- you know we're at a disadvantage because they say that two times in many, many, many years, they had positive results, whoever's in the White House, for whatever reason.
Trump	1	By the way, a lot of people in California don't want them, either.
Trump	1	You watch.
Trump	1	Very badly.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	I had the meeting.
Trump	1	[Applause] They stopped shooting missiles over Japan.
Trump	1	Wow.
Trump	1	But I really mean it, our people went out to vote.
Trump	1	Now, you can just say, "You're fired, get out, get out, get out."
Trump	1	Gone.
Trump	1	But as soon as soon as I say it, they say, "I can't believe I didn't think of that."
Trump	1	Even new people wouldn't do that.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Other than that, they're the fake news poll.
Trump	1	I want to use that word because it's a nice, soft word.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I'm not going to tell that to George Brett.
Trump	1	Was she scared?
Trump	1	He said, if one guy has a little bit of a cold hand, you lose a game, or if one guy has a hot hand for a good team, you could lose the game.
Trump	1	There's no games.
Trump	1	They do truly amazing life-saving work every single day.
Trump	1	What's going on there?
Trump	1	Now, you people know what that means.
Trump	1	I know them.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	But they said, darling, I really like that guy, but, you know, the polls say, according to some of the news, the media, because most people think it's legit, although that's changed a very lot.
Trump	1	I say, Fellas, slow up.
Trump	1	And I have it right now.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	It's very simple.
Trump	1	That's both at home and abroad.
Trump	1	Where's Kevin?
Trump	1	Just remember that.
Trump	1	And you look and you see a toughness that you don't see.
Trump	1	You have barriers against our farmers.
Trump	1	You're voting for me.
Trump	1	She's going to win.
Trump	1	 Thank you Mike.
Trump	1	So a lot of countries we're defending, it's not fair what's happening, they're paying us a tiny fraction in some cases.
Trump	1	Bob?
Trump	1	In real estate -- I love real estate -- when somebody doesn't pay their rent, you say – Shelley, you say their delinquent.
Trump	1	We were all together in a big room.
Trump	1	And after years of building up foreign countries, we are now building up our country.
Trump	1	It's booming again, folks.
Trump	1	I already know what they're doing with it.
Trump	1	And in addition to that, we've got ANWR.
Trump	1	It's up there.
Trump	1	Better than ever before.
Trump	1	So, the women's unemployment rate is not the lowest ever recorded, it's only the lowest level in 65 years.
Trump	1	You know we won Iowa, we won Nebraska...
Trump	1	We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from.
Trump	1	And we're allowing these people into our country?
Trump	1	You're restoring pride in this country again.
Trump	1	It's not a bad thing.
Trump	1	And he came here and we sold out, I don't know what the hell that arena was but it was a big one.
Trump	1	That felt good.
Trump	1	That's what they did.
Trump	1	And the way they are screaming and shouting and it's -- it's a disgrace to our country, actually.
Trump	1	So you don't have to wait online for two and a half weeks to see a doctor, like in the past.
Trump	1	You built this country.
Trump	1	We had -- think of this: We had the greatest election -- in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I finally heard it from a woman.
Trump	1	"In God We Trust".
Trump	1	It's called Keep America Great, exclamation point.
Trump	1	We can't do that because this is of paramount importance to our country.
Trump	1	We love them.
Trump	1	Boy, did we win by a lot.
Trump	1	Look at this as an example.
Trump	1	And only being a politician for a few years, I said, what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable.
Trump	1	They could be thieves.
Trump	1	Well, I don't think too many were better.
Trump	1	It was done until early in the morning.
Trump	1	No, no!
Trump	1	The Democrats' plan to destroy health care also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.
Trump	1	Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.
Trump	1	They had a great time.
Trump	1	Great generals, great people.
Trump	1	[Applause] And the mandate is gone forever.
Trump	1	He didn't vote for tax cuts.
Trump	1	We're doing a good job and you notice your premiums are not doing as badly as you ever thought.
Trump	1	Look what we're doing.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	You see what it's done for the country.
Trump	1	What each of you will have a chance in just four weeks to render your verdict on the Democrats conduct at the ballot box.
Trump	1	We will never, ever back down and we will never, ever surrender.
Trump	1	I have great respect for President Xi of China.
Trump	1	And I said to a couple of the top guys -- these are great people.
Trump	1	But that's not the same thing as a plant where you have 5,000 people working.
Trump	1	That's the problem.
Trump	1	Our highest.
Trump	1	Is this more fun?
Trump	1	This proud state would not exist if not for a handful of determined and defiant Texans who refused to surrender their rights nearly two centuries ago.
Trump	1	Democrats want to raise your taxes.
Trump	1	If you look -- I don't know about this, Cindy, but you take a look -- they don't do too well.
Trump	1	Too many young innocent -- they're probably not so innocent, especially coming from Montana.
Trump	1	I know I shouldn't say that, Jeff, but that's the way it is.
Trump	1	And these guys go in with the paddy wagons and they grab them, and they put them in, and they take them out, and we get them the hell out of our country, and we put them, in some cases, in jail.
Trump	1	Also joining us this evening is the U.S.
Trump	1	I'm not going to be a wise guy.
Trump	1	It's only -- listen to this -- it's only $10 billion with a B. I said, Greg, that's the most expensive dam I've ever heard of.
Trump	1	Just this week, I signed a groundbreaking new trade deal with South Korea that will dramatically increase exports of American made goods.
Trump	1	Come on, Justice Department, get us some judges over there, focus, focus.
Trump	1	We'll go to dinner with him, we'll take him out, we like him but he's never going to vote for it so I just want you to remember that, ok?
Trump	1	To get our great future Justice Kavanaugh, I think he's going to get there, too.
Trump	1	We build them here, and there's nothing like best submarines.
Trump	1	Great people.
Trump	1	He never saw Vietnam.
Trump	1	We don't like it."
Trump	1	Just recently, an illegal alien released by a sanctuary city in New Jersey was charged with a triple homicide in another state.
Trump	1	If you want more caravans and more crime, vote Democrat.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Did they apologize?
Trump	1	Got to do it.
Trump	1	 Thank you, Lee.
Trump	1	Our miners, we love the miners.
Trump	1	Everybody wants us, but how do you do that when people aren't paying?
Trump	1	President Obama had the lowest recovery since the Great Depression, so lowest.
Trump	1	They came from the heart.
Trump	1	Thank you, John.
Trump	1	We passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform.
Trump	1	By how much?
Trump	1	Oh, folks, stick with us.
Trump	1	Far greater.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	But instead of this massive crowd that's totally filling up this big hangar -- that is a big hangar -- so much so that we have to go outside.
Trump	1	It's going to be so popular, it's going to be bipartisan."
Trump	1	It will be interesting to see.
Trump	1	I said, Why do you ask?
Trump	1	Think of this, do you think they are going to put their great citizens, they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people.
Trump	1	In fact, now the number is almost 600,000, and that's since our election.
Trump	1	The women's unemployment rate in the United States recently reached its lowest rate in over 65 years.
Trump	1	This is a radical agenda by the Democrats.
Trump	1	If you want to drain the swamp, you must defeat the Democrats and you must defeat Senator Jon Tester.
Trump	1	It's true.
Trump	1	Well, they changed the standard so that our equipment doesn't qualify.
Trump	1	We got it.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I was good at getting it done.
Trump	1	They're protected by these cities.
Trump	1	And it is true -- I told David, "David, I paid these guys so much money over the years, built so many beautiful buildings."
Trump	1	All I know is you've got a lot of farmers in both, right?
Trump	1	I mean, I've done things -- I've done things that I never -- I never said we were going to get as an example with our vets, that we're going to get Choice, that we were going to have the ability to fire people that don't treat our vets properly.
Trump	1	And what do I get?
Trump	1	E15 will be sold in every single day of the year.
Trump	1	I mean, the fact is we need more Republicans.
Trump	1	"OK.
Trump	1	That's something that we get that we don't talk about much but that's a big thing.
Trump	1	I am failing with women.
Trump	1	You know why?
Trump	1	Now, when it's come to the military, I don't care about the jobs so much.
Trump	1	Also, there is another word that's never used, and I will use it today.
Trump	1	Wait.
Trump	1	Isn't that -- But you actually won.
Trump	1	You saw what happened two days ago with the Mexican military and the Mexican police.
Trump	1	It was not long ago that Sempra planned to build a natural gas import terminal on this very spot.
Trump	1	Would you say Saudi Arabia is wealthy?
Trump	1	And we're going to be stronger, as we are almost everywhere now, stronger than anyone by far.
Trump	1	Nobody could get it approved all the way back, and we got it approved, so that's good.
Trump	1	Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.
Trump	1	And I'm looking down, he's getting angrier and angrier.
Trump	1	When you're strong, you don't have to use it.
Trump	1	Under this ill-advised program, government bureaucrats discouraged banks from making loans to gun retailers -- a backdoor attack on private gun ownership that will never be allowed to happen on my watch.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I'm not moving fast enough.
Trump	1	So they said, how can we go after President Trump?
Trump	1	Republicans passed the biggest tax cuts in reform in American history.
Trump	1	Metallurgic coal, but our miners are back to work.
Trump	1	If this were President Obama, that would be the biggest story in the history of our country.
Trump	1	Where is he?
Trump	1	We moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.
Trump	1	I never liked red so much.
Trump	1	It was costing this country a fortune.
Trump	1	By the way, how have I done?
Trump	1	 Thank you all.
Trump	1	Thanks, Dan.
Trump	1	Remember?
Trump	1	But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal.
Trump	1	You never locked your door.
Trump	1	We won it, we won it so.
Trump	1	Among the most underappreciated people in this country, law enforcement, among the most -- dangerous, tough.
Trump	1	They're bringing in $350 billion and they're going to be building facilities all over, including an incredible campus.
Trump	1	It's called promises made, promises kept.
Trump	1	 Please.
Trump	1	So open borders, the whole world is going to go to California.
Trump	1	They want to abolish ICE.
Trump	1	I can't believe it even every speech.
Trump	1	For 40 years they tried to get the V.A.
Trump	1	 My fellow Americans.
Trump	1	And he died.
Trump	1	You saw that.
Trump	1	Nationwide, we average 300 power outages per year, compared to just five per year in the 1980s -- a total mess.
Trump	1	"Dad, you've got to get child tax credit."
Trump	1	Long over.
Trump	1	And it's passed.
Trump	1	We want to take care of our veterans.
Trump	1	A lot of people have spent their lives trying to be president.
Trump	1	You don't want to do it.
Trump	1	We can't do it.
Trump	1	And you're going to say, Dean, please see the president.
Trump	1	These endorsements -- and I'm not saying it from my standpoint.
Trump	1	We're fighting.
Trump	1	We want people like Mike Braun.
Trump	1	A vote for Rick's far left opponent, Senator Bill Nelson, who I never see.
Trump	1	So tell people, no more cars.
Trump	1	Then she had to come to Pennsylvania.
Trump	1	Then I heard him talk about the freedom of the press.
Trump	1	The men weren't bad, either, OK?
Trump	1	And what they would have done when the companies are all destroyed, they would have sent us steel and they would have charged whatever we would have paid.
Trump	1	We did it before I even left.
Trump	1	What they're saying to each other is not pretty, if you're a Democrat.
Trump	1	We will defend America's workers -- our great, great cherished workers -- that now we're taking care of.
Trump	1	The Democrats will never be able to do it.
Trump	1	Now, I assume that's a man that knows cotton and I'm saying what does the best cotton mean?
Trump	1	Remember when Nancy Pelosi got angry at me because she thought I didn't speak well of MS-13 gang members?
Trump	1	But our farmers are going to be able to sell now into Canada, which they were restricted from doing and -- and they're going to be able to sell into a lot of places.
Trump	1	And then we were dealing well, this was three, four weeks ago.
Trump	1	We have people that are so in love with us.
Trump	1	But I had one beer, that's the only thing I remember."
Trump	1	I blame our leadership.
Trump	1	They were coming out with a terminal illness that could've been corrected easily.
Trump	1	How many times did he say that?
Trump	1	They want them to vote.
Trump	1	It's great, and it's glorious.
Trump	1	Our supporters are some of the most honest, wonderful, like you... principled, hard-working, patriotic people on the face of God's Earth.
Trump	1	We love our vets.
Trump	1	He is fighting for Israel.
Trump	1	And furthermore -- and I appreciate this, from President Xi -- they've agreed that they're going to make it a major crime.
Trump	1	Not going to happen.
Trump	1	 Oh, thank you very much.
Trump	1	But we're going, no, we're going to Caterpillar.
Trump	1	I said, You know, John Kennedy?
Trump	1	That's "Du, Du," just that's not -- it is, too.
Trump	1	They know how to win, like Bobby.
Trump	1	But we're taking care of our farmers, and everybody is happy about it.
Trump	1	And Illinois is the state that gave us generations of proud farmers and steelworkers and miners and soldiers and patriots who made our country into the most powerful nation on Earth.
Trump	1	That's in history.
Trump	1	And, you know, what's happening right now, as a large group of people -- they call it a caravan.
Trump	1	Do you know what that means?
Trump	1	And before we continue, let me take a moment to send our love and support to our fellow citizens in North Carolina, South Carolina, and throughout the Southeast who are still recovering from your devastating -- that was a rain-soaked hurricane.
Trump	1	Look at what happened.
Trump	1	Something's going on.
Trump	1	As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never, ever fail.
Trump	1	And we will make America wealthy again.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	One person.
Trump	1	Bum, the greatest.
Trump	1	It's a great honor.
Trump	1	Great guy.
Trump	1	China is there.
Trump	1	And I built it within four months.
Trump	1	Is that okay?
Trump	1	And you know, the Japanese are great warriors, they're great warriors and that was not a good thing.
Trump	1	That's true.
Trump	1	Everything is there -- and you have problems with liability.
Trump	1	But we know that when the rules are fair, and you can compete, you will win against anyone anywhere in the world.
Trump	1	More people are working in our country today than at any point in the history of our country.
Trump	1	I can tell you, I meet the leaders of other countries, they say, Mr. President, congratulations.
Trump	1	That affects so many different thing.
Trump	1	What am I doing here?
Trump	1	But if Lee Greenwood doesn't like him, I'm going to say, David, you got to get out of here.
Trump	1	As President, the defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty.
Trump	1	I could tell you stories all night long, but the politicians may get tired and go home.
Trump	1	How simple is that?
Trump	1	So, a vote for any Democrat is November is a vote for Schumer, Pelosi, and Maxine.
Trump	1	Loyal citizens like you helped build this country and together, we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people.
Trump	1	They go, whoa,whoa.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	But China is one country.
Trump	1	We're getting rid of a lot bad ones.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] But we save the deal no longer.
Trump	1	In World War Two, it was aviators launched from the carrier Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown who filled the skies of Midway and turned the tide of the Pacific War.
Trump	1	It's happening every day.
Trump	1	Something is going on, and they are not happy back there.
Trump	1	Not even close.
Trump	1	Although a lot of the fake news said that he's not going to stop at eight years.
Trump	1	That's why we're putting in place a massive campaign for a midterm victory this November.
Trump	1	For years, you watched as your leaders apologize for America, right?
Trump	1	If you spend a little more than 150 thousand, that's okay, so we save a bit now it's temporary and it's set, but it's fine, it's nice and we get it open at a billion.
Trump	1	She was incredible, and she was so thankful that she's doing so well and they were giving her instructions on what you do when you're dying, and then all of a sudden this happened, and now it looks like she's going to be around for a long time, and there are many, many cases right there.
Trump	1	Hispanic Americans, all Americans.
Trump	1	Democrat immigration policies not only drain our treasury, but they threaten our communities.
Trump	1	And when you see me tomorrow, and you'll say, oh, isn't that so bad, look, he's so sunburned?
Trump	1	There's never been a march up that border like there is today, up throughout Mexico.
Trump	1	You liberate the town.
Trump	1	A man that really has been a friend of mine, a special friend, and he's really something.
Trump	1	Thank you, darling.
Trump	1	We've got to win Congress, in all fairness.
Trump	1	To help critically ill patients access life-saving treatments, we just passed something they've been trying to pass for 45 years.
Trump	1	Just like them, we're going to keep on fighting, we're going to keep on winning, we are going to win for our nation, our children, our families, for our freedom.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Last week, as I said, Toyota announced a massive investment.
Trump	1	So here's their new one -- he's not moving fast enough.
Trump	1	We're the nation that built the Empire State Building in less than one year and the Golden Gate Bridge and the incredible Panama Canal, which we gave away -- which we gave away -- we won two world wars.
Trump	1	They've taken so much.
Trump	1	Let us have a little information, please.
Trump	1	The left-wing media doesn't want to solve problems.
Trump	1	Republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift of God, and that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion of babies.
Trump	1	We had a great -- we had a great victory.
Trump	1	It's gone.
Trump	1	We are living in a different world and we have to be able to adapt.
Trump	1	[Laughter] The individual mandate is a disaster; it sounds good.
Trump	1	So here's the story, $1.1 billion and it will never get built.
Trump	1	Because our unemployment rate at 3.8 percent is so low -- now we're taking people off the rolls, and we're training people, but we need workers.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Technological positive change.
Trump	1	My wife, the First Lady, Melania said, "The women really like you."
Trump	1	And we're subsidizing them.
Trump	1	It's like pulling teeth.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I guess for my age I have great vision.
Trump	1	You see they're coming back.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And I looked at him, I said, but I don't blame you.
Trump	1	Here tonight from the Florida panhandle is Tina Belcher.
Trump	1	We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism.
Trump	1	And we don't want that.
Trump	1	We are so prepared.
Trump	1	Think of that, 19 years.
Trump	1	You know where we're talking about, right?
Trump	1	Not where we picked them out of a basket.
Trump	1	I said it here my last night.
Trump	1	Other than that it's a very fair deal.
Trump	1	Yes.
Trump	1	I mean, we're not just talking about going up to the Moon, going up to Mars.
Trump	1	[Audience chants Lock her up] That's starting to make a lot more sense.
Trump	1	They didn't just try to win.
Trump	1	And then we went to Indiana, where we had a crowd like this, and there were thousands and thousands of people outside.
Trump	1	You know what catch and release is, right?
Trump	1	That's why Connecticut's such a mess right now.
Trump	1	But a good guy.
Trump	1	And you see what's going on in Congress right now with one of the most respected people, potentially, hopefully Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Trump	1	We cannot get complacent.
Trump	1	[Applause] It's the state that gave us Notre Dame football, Hoosier basketball... [Applause] ... and the legendary Indy 500.
Trump	1	Even as Democrats I could pick better than that.
Trump	1	And it's going to destroy our country, and your taxes will be tripled.
Trump	1	So Kevin, again, thank you very much.
Trump	1	He's a sleepy guy.
Trump	1	You don't speak that way about America.
Trump	1	And it's a big deal.
Trump	1	And we're pouring a lot of money and a lot of talent into this horrible problem.
Trump	1	Thank you, Mike.
Trump	1	Big ceremony.
Trump	1	 There is something going on, Ohio, that they're not talking about.
Trump	1	Was that a nice day?
Trump	1	Because that's not really their name, it sounds better, flows better.
Trump	1	He will not win the election.
Trump	1	 Well, I want to thank everybody, because this was a rough, rough day for all of us.
Trump	1	Never happened.
Trump	1	But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers.
Trump	1	Our military will soon be stronger than it ever has been before.
Trump	1	And I thought I'd take a lot of heat, and instead we've been praised for not doing it.
Trump	1	The press doesn't give me any credit for anything, no matter what I do.
Trump	1	"We're going to cut your taxes."
Trump	1	We're doing what's right.
Trump	1	But I knew how to get it.
Trump	1	Remember what I said during the debates?
Trump	1	And Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement.
Trump	1	Went just like a rocket ship.
Trump	1	Great job.
Trump	1	And I said to Mexico last week -- you know, they have the strongest immigration laws in the world.
Trump	1	But we're going to keep these people out of our country.
Trump	1	So we're building the wall, as you know, it started.
Trump	1	And he has really helped.
Trump	1	That is why we are appointing federal judges who will interpret the law as written.
Trump	1	One hundred percent.
Trump	1	We're just -- developing a very special kind of a situation where hopefully in the future, 'cause you look at locationally, you look at it from any standpoint.
Trump	1	Can't say it better than that.
Trump	1	You look at what went on in Mexico where our car manufacturers went down there.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	About time.
Trump	1	"Because he wanted to terminate preexisting conditions."
Trump	1	The biggest tax cuts and reforms -- you got a lot of money back -- in the history of our country.
Trump	1	They have done such an incredible job for so long, and it's a tough job.
Trump	1	Nobody.
Trump	1	[Laughter] "Well, we didn't want you to do..." I said, "Oh, I'm sorry.
Trump	1	Great job.
Trump	1	I'm just not going to get it.
Trump	1	America will never apologize for protecting its citizens.
Trump	1	Jobless claims in Ohio have fallen to their lowest level ever recorded.
Trump	1	All those beautiful red hats, Make America Great Again... And we will discuss the next steps we must take to protect this amazing progress and to continue building an even greater future for all Americans.
Trump	1	So, we didn't want to get that wrong, right?
Trump	1	I won't ask you how it's doing since he left.
Trump	1	Because the wrong people are asking them.
Trump	1	And you've seen it before, and it's had an impact on smoking and cigarettes.
Trump	1	You're the first one to ask us our opinion."
Trump	1	Bruce flew through the darkness to his target, a tiny speck on the vast open sea.
Trump	1	But right now, America really is, once again, a nation of builders.
Trump	1	[Applause] Solar panels, 32 plants -- it's a new industry, so they weren't old.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	[Audience Member Calls Out, Trump laughs] Thank you.
Trump	1	And I said to our man, Sonny Perdue, "Sonny, we help so many people, but we don't help our people.
Trump	1	And he sure as hell didn't use it as much.
Trump	1	For years and years, you've watched as your leaders apologized for America.
Trump	1	Ron knows.
Trump	1	And a lot of great things are going to happen.
Trump	1	[Applause] We've eliminated record numbers of job-killing regulations.
Trump	1	Sold out for 20 years, like an office building.
Trump	1	Elizabeth Warren.
Trump	1	The people came from the hills and the valleys.
Trump	1	You see, that's a real protest.
Trump	1	And when Mike Pence went down just a few days ago with members of Congress and the media, and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps, they said, "Wow, these places are clean.
Trump	1	We're delivering the support of the federal government to help you overcome flooding and other natural disasters that have caused such terrible destruction.
Trump	1	Thank you fellas.
Trump	1	I said, "How much?"
Trump	1	Will he be prepared?
Trump	1	These people are sick.
Trump	1	[Laughter] That's because they never had to stand.
Trump	1	But it will be.
Trump	1	I said, you know, they've really become the party of crime.
Trump	1	We are respected again as a nation.
Trump	1	Lee Greenwood does not want it.
Trump	1	Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens, and Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and your great law enforcement.
Trump	1	Can we have our law enforcement take him out of here, please?
Trump	1	When everybody said, "Oh, he's just doing this for fun.
Trump	1	Except for one problem.
Trump	1	Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs than we do.
Trump	1	We are going to start using -- and we had these -- vocational schools where you learn trades, and you will do it and you will love it and you will make much more money than anything else you can do, right?
Trump	1	This is a movement like this country has never seen before.
Trump	1	Yes, we've started.
Trump	1	We got $1.6 billion, then we just got another $1.6 billion.
Trump	1	They need workers.
Trump	1	I think he wasn't even there.
Trump	1	Not automatic anymore.
Trump	1	I'm in Beijing doing this.
Trump	1	And every other business, by the way.
Trump	1	That's good.
Trump	1	I've become much more diplomatic.
Trump	1	Go out and vote.
Trump	1	And you know what?
Trump	1	They want to destroy your health care.
Trump	1	You don't have a border, you don't have a country, folks, OK, let's face it.
Trump	1	And my presidential budget was the first in history to include a proposal for nationwide paid family leave.
Trump	1	They couldn't do it.
Trump	1	Everything else was a catastrophe.
Trump	1	Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it.
Trump	1	We got health care that's good.
Trump	1	Hello, Missouri.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Let's put it this way: Wages are rising at a very fast level.
Trump	1	Congratulations to you all.
Trump	1	Everybody voted already?
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	And this group of major losers did not just ruthlessly attack me, my family, and everyone who questioned their lies, they tried to divide our country, to poison the national debate, and to tear up the fabric of our great democracy, the greatest anywhere in the world.
Trump	1	So we continue to decimate the remnants, because they're always going to be remnants, we can take the area the land, we'll soon have 100 percent, but they're always remnants, they get out, they wrap themselves in bombs.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	They're going to go crazy when I say this.
Trump	1	So we need more Republicans.
Trump	1	There's never been anything like it.
Trump	1	For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by Democrat politicians, and it's been total one-party control of the inner cities.
Trump	1	He's going to win by a lot.
Trump	1	Do we love our law enforcement?
Trump	1	It was getting worse and worse every year.
Trump	1	Where a person would have a job 21 years ago, 19 years ago from two years, where we were doing the campaign.
Trump	1	You and your whole group of wonderful people.
Trump	1	That's a lot of people.
Trump	1	Please go out and vote.
Trump	1	Where is he?
Trump	1	A couple of them you saw the other day.
Trump	1	It's not easy.
Trump	1	Every day, our police officers race into darkened allies and deserted streets, and onto the doorsteps of the most hardened criminals -- people you don't want to be dealing with.
Trump	1	And we're building the wall.
Trump	1	And we have a good partnership with the three.
Trump	1	Darling, I really like Donald Trump, but you know, he can't win because CNN did a poll.
Trump	1	And they want, I guess want -- I can't imagine they want -- but certainly drugs are flowing across borders.
Trump	1	Canada was taking advantage of the NFL.
Trump	1	Thank you, John.
Trump	1	Even with the veterans.
Trump	1	We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries.
Trump	1	I said it's ridiculous.
Trump	1	No good, no.
Trump	1	All the way.
Trump	1	That doesn't happen anymore, because we're going to make America wealthy again, we're going to make America strong again, we're going to make America safe again, and we will make America great again.
Trump	1	It didn't matter what you did you couldn't fire them.
Trump	1	A lot of us up here, not just here, a lot of it's right up here.
Trump	1	Tremendous strides.
Trump	1	We are going to make trade fair and reciprocal.
Trump	1	But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God.
Trump	1	They don't care how they get it.
Trump	1	Common sense.
Trump	1	They say, eight people who died, well, about 12 are just horribly injured.
Trump	1	Women smuggling, child smuggling.
Trump	1	Remember?
Trump	1	The first elements of this plan have already been put in place.
Trump	1	They think it's good politically.
Trump	1	Maroš, thank you very much.
Trump	1	It was put there to take advantage of the United States okay.
Trump	1	Great job, Eric.
Trump	1	Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and, by the way, who have paid for it, just in case we forget.
Trump	1	We have the highest stock market in history.
Trump	1	Dwight Eisenhower.
Trump	1	No.
Trump	1	They're coming here.
Trump	1	He will be one of the leaders of the Senate in a short period of time.
Trump	1	I said, Ralph, never be so far in front that they don't want to vote, OK?
Trump	1	But I'm thrilled to be here in Montana with thousands of loyal, hard-working, incredible American patriots... Hard to believe I'm saying this, because it was an incredible time, less than two years ago, but almost two years ago, right?
Trump	1	She's always had my back.
Trump	1	They'll never report that.
Trump	1	Don't forget.
Trump	1	How does that work?
Trump	1	Trudy Caviness from Wapello County.
Trump	1	There's been no ballistic missiles.
Trump	1	This is crazy.
Trump	1	You know, they have so many messages.
Trump	1	They said, "Oh, crime actually stayed the same."
Trump	1	But 65 years after today.
Trump	1	Nevada, we love you.
Trump	1	If this election is based on crowds, they might as well cancel it because we won.
Trump	1	So important.
Trump	1	"How would you like to head HUD?"
Trump	1	He's a good man.
Trump	1	Go to Africa.
Trump	1	Was that the most exciting evening of our lives?
Trump	1	I have said it before and I'll say it again: America will never be a socialist country -- ever.
Trump	1	And you know, included -- that nobody even talks about -- is ANWR in Alaska, one of the great sites of energy in the world.
Trump	1	That's what I do.
Trump	1	By the way, Opportunity Zones -- it's been incredible.
Trump	1	We will not ever leave your side.
Trump	1	So we got that and we got Accountability.
Trump	1	And they're doing a great job.
Trump	1	We are, by the way, the No.1 producer of energy in the world because of what we've done right now, The Democrats don't care about Russia, they only care about their own political power.
Trump	1	But you proved them wrong.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	They'll solve the problem very quickly.
Trump	1	I said, $1 billion.
Trump	1	But we'll get another shot.
Trump	1	We only are going to let people in based on merit.
Trump	1	The finest in the world -- finest in the world -- the iron ore, and it's coming in.
Trump	1	You're fired.
Trump	1	Good.
Trump	1	In fact, I'm just like -- but actually they respect us.
Trump	1	Barry Loudermilk.
Trump	1	They couldn't stand it because they're so dishonest.
Trump	1	I mean, the job he did in Newark.
Trump	1	Huh?
Trump	1	But incredible.
Trump	1	It's a game we can't lose.
Trump	1	It would be over.
Trump	1	This is where it's at.
Trump	1	Well, I said she's going to win, but I didn't know she was going to win so easily.
Trump	1	[Laughter] He was tough.
Trump	1	She challenged him.
Trump	1	And you know, with these lotteries that we have, we have lotteries from countries where people come in through a lottery system.
Trump	1	Hopefully nobody in this room is going to need it for a long time, but right to try is we have the greatest medicines and doctors in the world, and we never let anybody touch it until it was approved.
Trump	1	The next one comes, same thing.
Trump	1	They left and now they're coming back because they want to be where the action is and the action is in the United States of America.
Trump	1	And Brett Kavanaugh... And I'm not saying anything about anybody else, but I want to tell you that Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing or meeting.
Trump	1	Nobody understands it.
Trump	1	But if you don't elect Matt, I will tell you, they can change it very quickly.
Trump	1	Is it a Camaro?
Trump	1	Let's look at the rest of them.
Trump	1	I'm doing it for you, but we're doing the right thing.
Trump	1	They're going to do it.
Trump	1	And it is funny, you know, with the name.
Trump	1	And it is -- "Bring them to Washington.
Trump	1	That's why it's so important that we open up our steel mills again.
Trump	1	They say, did he say that?
Trump	1	Mark Meadows and Mrs. Meadows is here right now.
Trump	1	We will not bend.
Trump	1	We've gotten to know each other.
Trump	1	 And I didn't know Lee Greenwood would be here.
Trump	1	But few give anything to us.
Trump	1	They're going to be very famous.
Trump	1	They're going back, back, back.
Trump	1	They deserve it.
Trump	1	Make America great again, you know that.
Trump	1	How about that group, Biden?
Trump	1	It's a good thing.
Trump	1	A great movement.
Trump	1	They said, "Donald Trump, our president, was extremely rude to presidents and prime ministers" and in a couple of cases dictators, but that's all right.
Trump	1	We never even had people negotiating, they just do whatever they want, but take India.
Trump	1	Right.
Trump	1	I always say, when I get home to our first lady, Melania, who's great.
Trump	1	Do I get credit for saving a billion bucks?
Trump	1	He said my 401K is up 44 percent and my wife thinks I'm, for the first time, a financial genius.
Trump	1	We're really getting it.
Trump	1	Hundreds of millions of dollars we give to some of these countries, and they send them up.
Trump	1	"The train doesn't go good that way."
Trump	1	We are Americans, and there is no mountain we can't climb, no obstacle we can't reach, and no dream we cannot achieve.
Trump	1	Fake news.
Trump	1	 Thank you.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Of course, if the fake news did a poll, they're called suppression polls.
Trump	1	For years, you watched as your leaders apologized to other countries for America.
Trump	1	Here in Indiana, Steel Dynamics has announced a $75 million investment in Columbia City and a $400 million investment in Terre Haute.
Trump	1	And we were a little surprised when the thumb went down.
Trump	1	OK?
Trump	1	We have gotten rid of the estate tax, also known as the death tax.
Trump	1	Here are just some of our extraordinary achievements.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Got to do it.
Trump	1	Would you call it steel barriers?
Trump	1	As one united nation, we will work, we will pray, and we will fight for the day when every family across our land can live in a drug-free America.
Trump	1	[Applause] Sorry about that, Jim.
Trump	1	We're charting a path to stability and peace in the Middle East, because great nations do not want to fight endless wars.
Trump	1	We will make America safe again.
Trump	1	They don't even know what a trillion represents.
Trump	1	God bless you.
Trump	1	[Applause] Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon.
Trump	1	A vote for Steve's opponent, his name is Paul Davis.
Trump	1	Great equipment.
Trump	1	And there's nothing we can do about it.
Trump	1	And Mike's opponent, Brendan Kelly, is a vote for Nancy Pelosi and, of course, Maxine Waters... and their job-killing agenda.
Trump	1	So I think it's going to work out very well.
Trump	1	"Let terrorists that are in prison vote."
Trump	1	At the heart of our plan is tremendous relief for working families and small businesses.
Trump	1	But you people knew what was going on.
Trump	1	And they really helped me a lot.
Trump	1	We're going to take the right to try and we went through with the help of Cory, with the help of your great, wonderful -- you are a coal lover, aren't you, huh, Shelley?
Trump	1	So in making the deal with Mexico and then Canada, -- as you know, Canada was very tough, but that they worked out fine.
Trump	1	When a young family needs room to grow; when a new job sparks a new adventure in a brand new, beautiful city; when parents want to find the right neighborhood and schools for their children, Americans put our trust in you -- our great realtors.
Trump	1	And at my direction -- and we need Rand and we need Mitch's help, but it's really popular -- let them know how popular this is -- you know, it's all about space.
Trump	1	They're not too happy about it.
Trump	1	And I have to say, Rod is fighting to reform welfare, reduce crime, and continuously cut your taxes.
Trump	1	In other words, Jim, get out of here.
Trump	1	And Joe wakes up primarily when Schumer calls.
Trump	1	He's bringing the wealth back to the United States."
Trump	1	$32 million -- I guess you did a good job.
Trump	1	They said, "We don't want subsidy.
Trump	1	They've let you down."
Trump	1	[Laughter] They choke like dogs.
Trump	1	"Cane."
Trump	1	I talk about it all the time.
Trump	1	You are the men and women that make America truly great, and thank you.
Trump	1	The European Union has been very restrictive.
Trump	1	I must tell you, we have an election coming up that's going to be very important for you people, because they want to take it away.
Trump	1	Remember, manufacturing's never going to come back?
Trump	1	Thanks, Dan.
Trump	1	Well, he was first, so he just appointed them all and that was it.
Trump	1	I was center stage on every -- well, however many debates.
Trump	1	Finally, I want to introduce another terrific Republican candidate, your next congressman.
Trump	1	This November, Indiana will face an important choice: You can send a really incredible swamp person back to the Senate like Joe Donnelly or you can send us Republicans like Mike Braun to drain the swamp.
Trump	1	In less than two years, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps.
Trump	1	What a great defender he's been, what courage.
Trump	1	The vets were on my side because I got the job done.
Trump	1	And remember when I first came in or just before I came in, right, just before, everyone really thought we were going to war and that was going to be a potential nuclear catastrophe.
Trump	1	They're not.
Trump	1	We can't do that.
Trump	1	And just don't be complacent, OK?
Trump	1	They're going to try and take it away.
Trump	1	Remember I made that promise.
Trump	1	Is she OK?
Trump	1	Those are our friends.
Trump	1	I'm thrilled to be here in the great state of Florida, with the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
Trump	1	What can I do?
Trump	1	So these are "Workers Coming Off the Sidelines," and now it's just -- this is just partially.
Trump	1	And he's yours: Senator Bill Cassidy.
Trump	1	But we're becoming so strong again.
Trump	1	And together as a nation, we will make America wealthy again.
Trump	1	Was that the worst?
Trump	1	Do you ever notice CNN, Well, you know, he's not very popular.
Trump	1	And Masa Son -- you want to talk about another successful guy -- he was in my office.
Trump	1	Also at stake in this election is Medicare.
Trump	1	And Iran's been a much different country.
Trump	1	We didn't even try.
Trump	1	She was just incredible.
Trump	1	I know them too well.
Trump	1	So you got the better location, but...
Trump	1	Very, very unfair, very unfair to these people.
Trump	1	Unbelievable.
Trump	1	OK?
Trump	1	The result of our efforts has been an incredible resurgence of the American energy production.
Trump	1	And just in case you haven't seen it, one of his accusers came out on Friday and said she never met him, he didn't do the horrible thing that she said, she never met him, it didn't happen, she was lying.
Trump	1	Honestly, they're lousy politicians.
Trump	1	And if we would have told you during the campaign that we would create 3.3 million jobs in the short time, everybody back there, the fake news media -- look at all of them.
Trump	1	They go into a community.
Trump	1	We want the right to try.
Trump	1	So a vote for Joe is a vote to put Schumer in charge of the Senate and to put Dianne Feinstein in charge of Senate Judiciary Committee.
Trump	1	That's so great.
Trump	1	And Tlaib also used the F word to describe the presidency and your President.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] Come on in, free college.
Trump	1	Sleepy Joe Biden.
Trump	1	All of them will be out of business.
Trump	1	You know the movie.
Trump	1	In other words, she leaked.
Trump	1	He comes here.
Trump	1	We're not going to let it happen.
Trump	1	The Hispanic unemployment rate is at the lowest level in history.
Trump	1	I will use it.
Trump	1	That I can tell you.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	How good was Kanye West?
Trump	1	They say even if you rip it down and build a brand-new wall where the wall was, they call that a renovation.
Trump	1	And I said -- I said, Oh, we're not going to make things anymore.
Trump	1	But caravan after caravan is forming unvetted, illegal aliens trying to flood into our country on your dollar, over whelming your schools, depleting your resources, and endangering your community.
Trump	1	We passed massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country.
Trump	1	What are they doing?
Trump	1	And when parents watch their children thrive and grow, they're filled with joy beyond words, and a love beyond measure.
Trump	1	"Patrick Leahy-drink" will be in charge of the Appropriations Committee.
Trump	1	Our patriotic movement has been under assault from the very first day.
Trump	1	I said, why?
Trump	1	I said, "Because I want to get very smart people."
Trump	1	Some I'm disappointed in, but for the most part -- and I have to tell you something: We have the right ideas.
Trump	1	And by the way, you got thousands of people outside and you have thousands of people who I just saw in a lovely room, but I said, "Next time, you have to get here a couple of days earlier."
Trump	1	I called Novartis.
Trump	1	Mouth to mouth.
Trump	1	Like, I'm not sure he ever lost a match.
Trump	1	Made not in America, so therefore, I hope that's not what we do.
Trump	1	It's almost like, eh -- we just did it.
Trump	1	You know what?
Trump	1	Scott?
Trump	1	I mean, we -- China is down 38 percent, Kevin, because of tariffs, okay.
Trump	1	Yeah, some people did something, all right.
Trump	1	And when it comes to bad healthcare.
Trump	1	I like him.
Trump	1	This is our future -- our fate -- and our choice to make.
Trump	1	They're going to cover Pocahontas who was?
Trump	1	Look how many.
Trump	1	We have liberated towns out in Long Island.
Trump	1	Which is better?
Trump	1	I said, What do you have to lose?
Trump	1	He might -- this guy, I think you could qualify.
Trump	1	But thank you very much to the people and to the farmers of Wisconsin.
Trump	1	Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants.
Trump	1	Regulations were killing our country.
Trump	1	Dave Schweikert.
Trump	1	They won't take a piece of corn.
Trump	1	Biden -- I hear Biden wants to take me to the back of a barn.
Trump	1	Stacy Wilson runs the business with her family, and she joins us today.
Trump	1	Remember that.
Trump	1	I got the greatest -- we're going to have the people go to a private doctor and we're going to pay for it."
Trump	1	So true.
Trump	1	And I have tremendous respect for President Xi of China.
Trump	1	This election is about your families, your values, and what kind of country you want to leave for your children.
Trump	1	In other words, I actually met.
Trump	1	Unemployment for Hispanic Americans, the lowest level in history.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	We got it for the right price.
Trump	1	They would have cut that out.
Trump	1	That looks like a futuristic beautiful stuff.
Trump	1	To continue our incredible momentum, you need to get your friends, get your family, get your coworkers, and get out and vote for Ted Budd and Mark Harris, and vote Republican.
Trump	1	I'm making you unfair trade deals in our favor, OK?
Trump	1	And... We lifted over 4 million people off of food stamps.
Trump	1	Vote for Leah.
Trump	1	They have to come in through merit.
Trump	1	We didn't get one Democrat vote.
Trump	1	I don't know.
Trump	1	If you want to have a country, if you want borders -- how about borders?
Trump	1	The remains.
Trump	1	And by the way, by the way, a woman who has been so good, so talented, so wonderful and we're sort of going to be losing.
Trump	1	And Greg, right?
Trump	1	And how we've done this for so many years, folks, how we've done this.
Trump	1	I want to build it all at one time, but wait till -- wait till you see -- go home and see tonight what our great military is doing on the border.
Trump	1	Governor, thank you.
Trump	1	What the hell?
Trump	1	A young bartender, wonderful young woman, the Green New Deal.
Trump	1	We're going to get the prescription prices down, though.
Trump	1	If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office.
Trump	1	You've got to campaign harder in North Carolina, you know?
Trump	1	Democrats want to abolish America's borders and allow drugs and gangs to pour into our country unabated.
Trump	1	Seriously.
Trump	1	We're respected again.
Trump	1	They had the top man at Comcast came up to see me in my office with a whole group of people, please, please renew your contract for The Apprentice.
Trump	1	Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and they've paid for it.
Trump	1	Did I leak?
Trump	1	Thank you very much, Montana.
Trump	1	You protect us.
Trump	1	That's Bobby Knight.
Trump	1	We're an economic -- we have created such wealth.
Trump	1	And we appreciate it.
Trump	1	The whole thing, we won.
Trump	1	I thought I was so smart.
Trump	1	And we don't want it anymore.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	A lot of them have just great start.
Trump	1	Nucor's opening up plants all over the place, in many cases, their brand-new.
Trump	1	They say, no, we're going to deny them.
Trump	1	[Applause] And these people, you remember, I said, "I can't believe it.
Trump	1	He said, "well, I may.
Trump	1	You see what they're dealing with?
Trump	1	You have all these rich guys.
Trump	1	Two percent come back.
Trump	1	These are tough people.
Trump	1	That's all right.
Trump	1	We will not ban.
Trump	1	So now, instead of if you have money -- if you don't have money, there's -- you just go to your room.
Trump	1	I don't think so.
Trump	1	It's overseas profits, bringing the money back home to our country where it belongs.
Trump	1	And he is going to be a truly great senator.
Trump	1	He says call her Pocahontas.
Trump	1	Lou.
Trump	1	But the thing that we've done is very special.
Trump	1	Not reciprocal.
Trump	1	They've been promising everything, nothing happens.
Trump	1	They will take away your taxes.
Trump	1	You know, they say, took.
Trump	1	Wouldn't you think they'd get tired of these speeches?
Trump	1	We nearly doubled the standard deduction and did double the child tax credit -- [Applause] -- which Ivanka wanted very much, I will tell you.
Trump	1	We find a way, that always find a way.
Trump	1	True.
Trump	1	Spend a lot of time in Boone County.
Trump	1	It's gone.
Trump	1	Tremendous help.
Trump	1	[Applause] And while Democrats sit on their hands, Republicans stand with law enforcement.
Trump	1	This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	We pay 25 percent.
Trump	1	We need more faith in this country.
Trump	1	We are not going back we're going on to victory, going on to victory.
Trump	1	In 2017, drugs killed over 70,000 of our fellow citizens -- think of that, that's like a football stadium loaded up -- and imposed costs on our society in excess of $700 billion dollars.
Trump	1	These stories were coming out.
Trump	1	Yet, in the face of MS-13 and its threat, Washington, Democrats voted against legislation to remove these criminal aliens.
Trump	1	Go outside and take a look.
Trump	1	We will stand proudly behind our devoted doctors and nurses and medical professionals who work so hard, and they do so much.
Trump	1	We're going to go into his finances.
Trump	1	And it's unfortunate.
Trump	1	It caused premiums and deductibles to explode, and healthcare options to plummet.
Trump	1	It's like the Academy Awards.
Trump	1	They pay that big, beautiful tariff and it goes right into building new ships.
Trump	1	Remember I tell you the story, and America's being respected again all over the world.
Trump	1	In January of 2012, the Alexanders attended the March for Life, and God put it in their hearts to adopt a beautiful child.
Trump	1	We're going to keep -- you go back and tell the people of Illinois and the rest of this country we're going to keep on winning.
Trump	1	Sixty-five years, best in 65 years.
Trump	1	By the way, I hate to say it, these are our best jobs.
Trump	1	You know what's going on.
Trump	1	We will never give in.
Trump	1	They're going back to Ohio.
Trump	1	Because people want -- we have 180 million people that want that.
Trump	1	Medicare belongs to the seniors who have earned it and paid into it for their entire lives.
Trump	1	I would have been happier with a nice yes vote instead of a no vote, but that's OK. We're doing great.
Trump	1	And by the way, they did debate last night, and I may be a little bit partial, he really beat her badly.
Trump	1	You know, when I came to office, weeks before I was given rundowns of what's happening, and Iran was just a question of when will they take over the entire Middle East?
Trump	1	We will make America safe again.
Trump	1	[Applause] And you know, I hate to bring this up -- [Laughter] -- but we came this close to winning the state of Minnesota.
Trump	1	And now, if you think about it -- if you think about it, just take a look.
Trump	1	And here's a nice story.
Trump	1	You know, after the attack -- we had to do that.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	"No, no I'll call you next week.
Trump	1	They're not giving us anything.
Trump	1	[Applause] Space Force.
Trump	1	Now they have to do it.
Trump	1	That's where we'll be.
Trump	1	Can't let that happen.
Trump	1	[Applause] We're going to build the wall.
Trump	1	But look at these numbers.
Trump	1	You know, there's no win... We are proud to be America and the future belongs to us.
Trump	1	Anything I want, they want to oppose.
Trump	1	 That's right, USA.
Trump	1	We are standing up for your values.
Trump	1	We have plenty of time tonight.
Trump	1	And finally, to all of our wonderful supporters, your drive and commitment are the heart and soul of this party, and this is a great party, we're doing fantastic things, so, thank you all very much, and I want to thank you for something else.
Trump	1	They like that.
Trump	1	Keep America great.
Trump	1	I used to hear about a man named Brett Kavanaugh who someday will be on the Supreme Court, because of the intellect.
Trump	1	But their crime is up more than 10 percent since they started taking them in.
Trump	1	Get our steel from some foreign country?
Trump	1	What a job she's done.
Trump	1	We had a job, Swifton Village, Swifton.
Trump	1	We'll give them -- they're fine.
Trump	1	And I really realized how powerful this position is.
Trump	1	And we have Pastor Thom O'Leary, from the area.
Trump	1	That's a lot of corn.
Trump	1	They had Puerto Rico.
Trump	1	There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.
Trump	1	We are making America greater than ever before.
Trump	1	But I head President Obama speak today.
Trump	1	If you don't have that barrier, there's not a thing you can do.
Trump	1	Forty-four billion.
Trump	1	I said I don't want to talk to these people.
Trump	1	I would imagine.
Trump	1	Can you explain why am I going to lose Michigan?
Trump	1	And, yes, we will finish the wall.
Trump	1	 Thank you.
Trump	1	We are not going to have it.
Trump	1	They're not going to beat the day from two years ago, but it's going to be interesting nevertheless.
Trump	1	We're bringing back our factories, reopening our mines.
Trump	1	Do you want to keep playing this game?
Trump	1	[Audience chants Build the wall] So we started the wall.
Trump	1	Venezuela.
Trump	1	We're allowed to cross state lines, you're going to get very low prices for very good [Inaudible] ...
Trump	1	More American ethanol production also means less dependence on foreign suppliers.
Trump	1	He turned it over to the FBI, hoping to put me in jeopardy.
Trump	1	He just voted no.
Trump	1	Illegal immigration exploits vulnerable populations, hurts hardworking citizens, and has produced a vicious cycle of crime, violence, and poverty.
Trump	1	And he said, this is the greatest honor of my life.
Trump	1	Where are you Charlie?
Trump	1	Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream.
Trump	1	But our new slogan will be "Keep America Great," because that's what we're doing.
Trump	1	Doing very well.
Trump	1	[Audience Chants USA] We're going to lower taxes.
Trump	1	I love the name.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Do the women understand that?
Trump	1	Asia is not doing well.
Trump	1	Well, one in the Senate, very few in the House.
Trump	1	But that was included.
Trump	1	What do I do, Mom?"
Trump	1	And now our steel, aluminum industries are roaring back to life, like nothing you've ever seen.
Trump	1	Right now, they just want to survive.
Trump	1	Because I'll tell you what, this country is tired of being ripped off by other countries.
Trump	1	Hi.
Trump	1	They will fight to the death because they don't want us to have the wall.
Trump	1	And I think he enjoyed it.
Trump	1	Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.
Trump	1	Think of it, one in four and I think the numbers were worse than that and so do you.
Trump	1	He was supposed to be vacationing on the Tallahassee Trail, but he was actually in Argentina.
Trump	1	And that's what we're doing.
Trump	1	Come up."
Trump	1	Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue.
Trump	1	You had to see the forms that had to be filled out.
Trump	1	I recently announced that we are replacing the horrible, horrible NAFTA deal.
Trump	1	It's about delivering safety and opportunity for every family.
Trump	1	You see what's happening.
Trump	1	The 98 percent are much more than the two percent that come back.
Trump	1	And some communities in California, of all places, down to miss San Diego, we're just about finishing it up.
Trump	1	How crazy is it?
Trump	1	Mike?
Trump	1	It's not going to be a steady incline.
Trump	1	There's no more -- the nuclear testing stopped.
Trump	1	Very important.
Trump	1	And they build a section, and then they build another section way away, and then another section.
Trump	1	You look at Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media giants.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	You know why?
Trump	1	Over the last year, Justice Gorsuch has embodied the most sacred principles of the Court – making impartial decisions based upon the Constitution.
Trump	1	He said, I use Jerusalem stone.
Trump	1	Do you remember?
Trump	1	[Laughter] I think if they saw you, they'd be happy, very, very happy.
Trump	1	As you all know, there is currently a tremendous humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.
Trump	1	You know, about a month ago, two months ago, I was hearing about this horrendous blue wave.
Trump	1	Wants to abolish ICE.
Trump	1	James, great job.
Trump	1	Ralph.
Trump	1	And then it began.
Trump	1	You think that was easy?
Trump	1	I say you got to do more.
Trump	1	But all I know is we were 16 down.
Trump	1	You had people that would -- would be terrible to our vets, and you couldn't fire them.
Trump	1	We go to 24.
Trump	1	That's been 45 years they've been trying to get it.
Trump	1	You believe in hard work and self-reliance.
Trump	1	I had such a great life.
Trump	1	Huh?
Trump	1	I never said this before.
Trump	1	So we've been here by that time three, three and a half years, we're going into the war with some socialists.
Trump	1	No.
Trump	1	It's a great place.
Trump	1	"One week, sir."
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.
Trump	1	We have many many car companies, you see.
Trump	1	We're keeping our promises and the results are in: 3 million new jobs since Election Day.
Trump	1	The women are -- they are beating you pretty good men.
Trump	1	Now, when you hear the words human traffickers, you think about 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago.
Trump	1	I care about everybody.
Trump	1	They were supposed to pay.
Trump	1	And you know, we'll be running together in 2020.
Trump	1	We come from backgrounds, and it doesn't matter the color, the creed.
Trump	1	Where is he?
Trump	1	Other than that, doesn't work out.
Trump	1	You'll see a lot of, I mean, a lot of things are happening.
Trump	1	They are now leaving other countries and they are coming back to Michigan.
Trump	1	It's -- I can't even tell you.
Trump	1	Drain the swamp.
Trump	1	Toledo.
Trump	1	And Kevin is special.
Trump	1	Right, Linda?
Trump	1	It's time.
Trump	1	What could be wrong with that?
Trump	1	If you have to wait for any extended period of time, you go outside, you go to a local doctor.
Trump	1	But, that would be too bad.
Trump	1	That -- now they're saying it with Putin.
Trump	1	You always have to have alternatives, that a lot of good alternatives, sometimes better, some of it's better.
Trump	1	Ronald Nunez lost his energy job over 20 years ago, back in 2015.
Trump	1	You know why, it always does.
Trump	1	A lot of them.
Trump	1	And we've got a lot coming.
Trump	1	Before I said, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.
Trump	1	That's the way life works, isn't it?
Trump	1	In the last month alone, we added another 250,000 jobs and nearly half a million Americans rejoined the workforce.
Trump	1	Ted Cruz, where's Ted?
Trump	1	And Germany -- Germany which is the biggest country of the E.U., European Union, Germany pays 1 percent One percent.
Trump	1	It was a total lie.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	We need Democrat votes.
Trump	1	But I had a choice, I could have stayed out there and listened or I could have come out to the people of El Paso in Texas.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	But they are now back and they're doing great, and they're so happy and they're so prepped.
Trump	1	We love Justice Gorsuch.
Trump	1	Forty-two points over a Democrat, right, over a Democrat.
Trump	1	Put a lot of pressure on your Congressmen and your Senators because they have to ratify it.
Trump	1	We will make America strong again.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Our faith and confidence in you is absolute and total.
Trump	1	I should've told you to sit down earlier.
Trump	1	Those businesses are through the roof.
Trump	1	So we have to make a decision Make America Great Again or Keep America Great, Keep America Great or Make America Great Again.
Trump	1	That is more than true.
Trump	1	In just 15 days, the people of Texas are going to re-elect a man who has become a really good friend of mine.
Trump	1	The trade stuff is coming along, just starting but it's going to happen because, you know, with the piggy bank that everybody likes to rob from, they like to steal from.
Trump	1	And Jimmy Duncan, right, Jimmy.
Trump	1	Where are you?
Trump	1	And then you hear, "The elite has just said."
Trump	1	He started a little slow but he likes Trump.
Trump	1	We have some incredible drugs and potential cures in the pipeline.
Trump	1	Open borders equals crime, tremendous crime.
Trump	1	The Democrats allow those loopholes to be there.
Trump	1	That was a good job.
Trump	1	Merit.
Trump	1	And, frankly, if I would have said that during the election, the fake-news media would not have believed it.
Trump	1	What did you to?
Trump	1	And how about in Virginia, where -- we're not talking about up until birth, but the governor of Virginia said after birth.
Trump	1	America now has the best economy in the history of our country, and we want to keep it that way.
Trump	1	What are they doing?"
Trump	1	Minnesota House Speaker Kurt Daudt.
Trump	1	RNC Co-chair Bob Paduchik, Bob, I love Bob, I love Bob.
Trump	1	Your company President, Justin Bird, and your Chief Operating Officer, Lisa Glatch.
Trump	1	He's become my friend actually.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	They're still the same old deal.
Trump	1	So we are delighted to be joined this evening by some really incredible people.
Trump	1	Just recently reached an agreement to eliminate restrictions and expand exports of American beef -- you saw that -- to Japan by up to $200 million a year.
Trump	1	But Mike did a good job, and I did good job.
Trump	1	So important.
Trump	1	We're negotiating with Mexico.
Trump	1	You'd better get up there darling.
Trump	1	Who would have thought in our country?
Trump	1	And they want to erase America's borders.
Trump	1	We love you.
Trump	1	You wouldn't even believe it.
Trump	1	But you know what, now, America fought back and all of these companies are coming back into our nation again, they want to be where the action is.
Trump	1	This was the greatest movement, 2016, all of those hats, Make America Great Again.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Including thousands of vicious gang members and MS-13 predators.
Trump	1	We got to get it right to make our country great again, we have to get it right.
Trump	1	But we're now taking in 1,000 jobs a day, and these are industrial, beautiful manufacturing jobs.
Trump	1	That's OK.
Trump	1	I'll tell you what: Russia's very unhappy that Trump won, that I can tell you.
Trump	1	But he's probably got nothing, but sue him forever.
Trump	1	And each of you is living proof that American workers are truly the best in the world, right?
Trump	1	African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment has reached the lowest level ever recorded in our country's history.
Trump	1	And we opened it already.
Trump	1	It was never done.
Trump	1	They're coming back and they're coming back fast.
Trump	1	From your House delegation we have David Kustoff.
Trump	1	And David, thank you, and all of those people.
Trump	1	This is -- this is very serious stuff.
Trump	1	And I wasn't pushing it too hard, to be honest with you, because I was more focused on the tax cuts.
Trump	1	People of Florida, as we speak, the Democrat Party -- do you notice, I don't say Democratic -- I say Democrat, because that's their name, even though the other flows so much nicer.
Trump	1	And they'll be out over the next four weeks.
Trump	1	They say, what are you going to resist?
Trump	1	Goodbye, folks.
Trump	1	Number two, the country's saving a fortune, think of it.
Trump	1	"We will move our Embassy to Jerusalem."
Trump	1	We'll be another Venezuela.
Trump	1	Because the wrong people follow us in office, it could all be gone.
Trump	1	That's why we get along, but you have to go out on Tuesday and vote.
Trump	1	We've unleashed American energy independence.
Trump	1	I have a great friend of mine Mr. & Mrs. Phil Ruffin are here today.
Trump	1	There's never been an administration that in already less than two years -- but can you believe we all did this together?
Trump	1	And I want to thank you to everyone here today for your investment in America's future, and for your devotion to the American worker.
Trump	1	The lead.
Trump	1	Now they're saying Merry Christmas again.
Trump	1	Donnelly also supports open borders.
Trump	1	What she said about men is so bad.
Trump	1	He's a winner.
Trump	1	After spending all of that money in the Middle East, can you imagine?
Trump	1	[Inaudible] [Applause] Thank you, Kevin.
Trump	1	And Tester said things about him which were a disgrace.
Trump	1	Airplanes full of cash.
Trump	1	Is that your husband?
Trump	1	It does it -- that's why having Lindsey and David and all of the people that I mentioned, and so many more back in Washington really want to stop it, and we've got to win the election, we're going to win it, we're going to win a big.
Trump	1	The Governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby, wrap the baby up, make the baby comfortable, to be executed after birth.
Trump	1	And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the 6th branch of the American Armed Forces called the Space Force.
Trump	1	And then on top of it, a couple of months ago, I just approved the Golan Heights for Israel, the Golan Heights.
Trump	1	I -- I shouldn't say this.
Trump	1	And everybody -- I'll tell you, Jon is with a friend of mine, and they decided to get together, which is very smart.
Trump	1	We have a conflict and we call China?
Trump	1	So when I woke up, I said, "This is going to be great.
Trump	1	Da Nang province right down Da Nang.
Trump	1	They said it couldn't be done.
Trump	1	[Applause] Boy oh boy.
Trump	1	Now they call, "Mr. President, sir."
Trump	1	 That's a great song, isn't it?
Trump	1	They'd had no hope.
Trump	1	We want to help people and we want to be gracious and we want people, we need people frankly, because we have so many companies moving into our country.
Trump	1	Other countries say, "Get out.
Trump	1	It's the weirdest thing.
Trump	1	They hated the answer.
Trump	1	We're opening up unbelievable healthcare cross state lines, highly competitive.
Trump	1	Sir, we really don't want to meet.
Trump	1	They have a sheet out that it's $98.2 billion, OK?
Trump	1	Forty-four years, they've been trying to get it done.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	It's crazy -- I mean it's crazy.
Trump	1	And from there, the first shipment of Cameron LNG will travel down the Gulf of Mexico, through the Panama Canal, and off to Asia to illuminate cities on the other side.
Trump	1	See, to me that means something because being a champion is something -- And that's one that is tough stuff and dangerous stuff.
Trump	1	We have to win.
Trump	1	The Democrats want to protect illegals coming into this country, some of whom are not good, some of whom cause lots of problems in the worst possible way, they want to protect illegals coming into the country, much more so than they want to protect you, and that's not where we're coming from, OK?
Trump	1	She went in with her arms wide open.
Trump	1	Can we resist?
Trump	1	He's a great guy.
Trump	1	Thank you, Iowa.
Trump	1	Food stamps is very expensive.
Trump	1	And they say you can add 10 percent -- because 10 percent of the people love us, but they're ashamed to say, "That I'm voting for the president."
Trump	1	They want them made in China.
Trump	1	He brings them all.
Trump	1	We will build new strengths into our country.
Trump	1	We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America and together with the proud people of the Panhandle, the proud people of Florida, we will make America wealthy again.
Trump	1	Close to my heart.
Trump	1	I said, Check and see whether or not this is Coach Knight.
Trump	1	It took me one hour, but it was a rough hour.
Trump	1	It's called America first.
Trump	1	And right here in the Hawkeye State, the backyards and living rooms, and town halls, and fairgrounds, and diners, and coffee shops all across the state.
Trump	1	American steel, which we now have coming back, by the way, like never before and generations of American patriots.
Trump	1	They've gone totally loco.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	We support the rule of law and we support the heroes of law enforcement.
Trump	1	We turned the country around.
Trump	1	He was -- he was taken during the Obama administration years, and they never came close.
Trump	1	These are the values that unite people all across the great State of Texas.
Trump	1	We are one united movement, one united people and one United States of America and together we are the proud people of Pennsylvania, a great state, a beautiful state, a tough state.
Trump	1	We've got to have it.
Trump	1	Forty-four years.
Trump	1	We had a little bit of a soft patch and I called in a group of 15 or 20 representative farmers and I wanted to give them help, I wanted to give them aid.
Trump	1	We are really putting them back to work.
Trump	1	We've never seen anything like it.
Trump	1	I said we're watching; with all the aide we give all these countries, we're watching.
Trump	1	Well, I was the one that said we're not, and guess what?
Trump	1	[Applause] Great job.
Trump	1	You hear them, they’re noisy.
Trump	1	And when I told him that it's my honor -- because we did great with, as you know, Justice Neil Gorsuch -- you know that.
Trump	1	What do you think Big Jim would be making today in the NFL?
Trump	1	In choosing a new Justice, I will select someone with impeccable credentials, great intellect, unbiased judgement, and deep reverence for the laws and Constitution of the United States.
Trump	1	Who made these deals?
Trump	1	We have all of the enthusiasm.
Trump	1	Women for Trump.
Trump	1	He's bad.
Trump	1	That's very exciting.
Trump	1	What can I say?
Trump	1	But the cutting of regulations, in many ways, might be just as important or more important.
Trump	1	You know, a lot of them were unpopular, like in this state.
Trump	1	We will fully secure the border.
Trump	1	Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary city for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.
Trump	1	Act large.
Trump	1	We won South Carolina easily, but that was expected.
Trump	1	Suppression polls.
Trump	1	We lived with them for 25 years.
Trump	1	I don't have to do this.
Trump	1	But we're getting prepared for the caravan, folks.
Trump	1	Ladies and gentlemen of the state of Florida, thank you very much for being here.
Trump	1	We endorsed him.
Trump	1	We got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare.
Trump	1	So they say go into the locker room.
Trump	1	That was some campaign, wasn't it?
Trump	1	Last month, we announced a groundbreaking U.S.-Mexico trade agreement.
Trump	1	What a vote that was.
Trump	1	We have the best military in the world, but now we're going to have -- it's equipped with the finest.
Trump	1	In fact, he even used, as I remember, the Justice Department to go after reporters.
Trump	1	I said, What does that mean?
Trump	1	He is fantastic.
Trump	1	You know, when they look at your country as not being strong, from certain standpoints -- like when they're used to taking advantage of your country, they all get very much tougher than they should be.
Trump	1	And I'll tell you, he got on television and he said great things.
Trump	1	Everybody else does.
Trump	1	Please, April.
Trump	1	Now, if there's a wait, you go to a local doctor, you get yourself taken care of, and we pay for the bill.
Trump	1	You know, we had these globalists.
Trump	1	And we're going to do it all under budget and ahead of schedule.
Trump	1	Work every single -- I don't even have to tell him.
Trump	1	What is he doing?
Trump	1	By the end of this year, murders in major cities are estimated to drop by close to 10 percent from their levels in 2016.
Trump	1	To rebuild this nation, we must reclaim that proud heritage.
Trump	1	I can do it in a year.
Trump	1	People that were sitting on stairwells, people that couldn't get a seat, people that were here only cause the fire marshals were so incredible, that shouldn't have even been allowed to come in, with thousands outside, they said, "This is a fraud by the Washington Post."
Trump	1	Never met him, never saw him and the act never happened and it was a lie.
Trump	1	Some people don't understand it.
Trump	1	We're going to win so much and the people of Florida actually love, don't they?
Trump	1	She's not getting the money from here.
Trump	1	We're -- we're taking care of their military.
Trump	1	Think of that, 127,000.
Trump	1	We'll be stronger than ever before, and hopefully, you know what, we'll never have to use our military.
Trump	1	They would take over American healthcare; take away your Second Amendment; and ship away your jobs to other countries, like has gone on for so many years.
Trump	1	We won South Carolina.
Trump	1	Greatest phrase ever used in politics, I suspect.
Trump	1	Great people, incredible people.
Trump	1	Go back to the country.
Trump	1	But we have many, many companies moving back and I speak to the top people and I speak to the presidents of countries and the prime ministers of countries.
Trump	1	You have been there from the day I announced that I was going to run for president.
Trump	1	But it's a very sad situation.
Trump	1	The numbers are staggering, five million off of foods.
Trump	1	But they had a way of doing it.
Trump	1	But despite our amazing success, the Democrat Party has never been angrier, they're so angry.
Trump	1	Terrible, terrible deal.
Trump	1	We also passed a landmark -- and this was just as tough, believe it or not -- V.A.
Trump	1	He is a man with tremendous spirit.
Trump	1	Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.
Trump	1	We're not talking just South America, Latin America.
Trump	1	We have to protect our law enforcement just like they protect us.
Trump	1	We're winning.
Trump	1	He was some -- some player.
Trump	1	And they respect us again.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] But he suffered a great defeat.
Trump	1	It's up to you to decide your fate.
Trump	1	What a great guy!
Trump	1	That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates.
Trump	1	So as the caravan -- and, look, that is an assault on our country.
Trump	1	And we've cut a record number of job-killing regulations.
Trump	1	And this movement is stronger now than it was three years ago.
Trump	1	But let's see if she gets away with it.
Trump	1	What a job they have done.
Trump	1	It was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Trump	1	A landmark VA accountability law.
Trump	1	But they're friends of mine.
Trump	1	These people but -- so you have to be careful what you say.
Trump	1	And we will say again tonight that America will never be a socialist country ever, never, never.
Trump	1	And based on the votes -- [Laughter] -- I should love it very much.
Trump	1	[Applause] Very unfair.
Trump	1	We got to let them use it, and that's called right to try, because I know people, they traveled all over the world looking for -- looking for hope.
Trump	1	He will be great.
Trump	1	We're protecting you.
Trump	1	Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers including African-American workers.
Trump	1	[Laughter] But it was a great letter.
Trump	1	I mean, that four million people that's a lot of money at cause.
Trump	1	History has said that that's trouble.
Trump	1	And congressman -- powerful.
Trump	1	You know, we're paying for all this through growth.
Trump	1	So she was right.
Trump	1	[Laughter] If I have another daughter, I think I'm going to name her -- [Laughter] -- is that okay?
Trump	1	We get nothing.
Trump	1	And in case you have not noticed, we have become a lot stronger lately.
Trump	1	How about if you don't get them?
Trump	1	No more individual mandate.
Trump	1	A supreme court judge -- fantastic -- Justice Gorsuch.
Trump	1	They don't want to lose their jobs.
Trump	1	These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.
Trump	1	 Well, thank you very much.
Trump	1	We essentially stopped the dumping.
Trump	1	A person that you know very well, and everybody in West Virginia loves Carol Miller.
Trump	1	He's a tool of Chuck Schumer and, of course, the MS-13 lover, Nancy Pelosi.
Trump	1	And they said, "Well, you know -- " because China and various of these countries that were rightfully doing numbers on them because we have no choice what they've done to us.
Trump	1	But now they love it.
Trump	1	I like to meet.
Trump	1	That means you are going to make more cars right here in the good old USA.
Trump	1	And to keep America safe, we're rebuilding America's military might like never before, including $133 million for the Gulf Coast test range.
Trump	1	We're not looking up in the air.
Trump	1	The fake news people back there, all those people with all those red lights... they don't want to talk about it.
Trump	1	We have just started.
Trump	1	But it doesn't say Tax cut.
Trump	1	 Hello, Mississippi, hello.
Trump	1	They fought so hard, not to take care of our vets and not to take care of our military.
Trump	1	These are the midterms.
Trump	1	We have to get some more Republican votes.
Trump	1	And, by the way, China, already started.
Trump	1	But they're hot.
Trump	1	Great guy.
Trump	1	But we want to keep it just that way.
Trump	1	We got this great state...
Trump	1	They copied mine, Promises Made, Promises Kept.
Trump	1	And God bless America.
Trump	1	I'd be afraid to call Kevin.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Like him.
Trump	1	We have a little bit of a difference.
Trump	1	And because of that incredible power, hopefully we will never have to use it, right?
Trump	1	My father and I would have designed it a straight path, point to point, right?
Trump	1	We have tremendous sanctions on North Korea.
Trump	1	But I have to say, so this is my last stop, right?
Trump	1	That's why we have to go in November.
Trump	1	You know.
Trump	1	You still have factories that are empty, that are dead for years because they moved to Mexico and Canada, and we're replacing it with the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the USMCA, which I like -- YMCA.
Trump	1	They want to take them away.
Trump	1	You had massive pecan farms where there wasn't one tree standing.
Trump	1	And the strides that we're making have never, ever been made like this before.
Trump	1	You had thieves that were stealing -- openly stealing.
Trump	1	Over the last two decades, the United States racked up $12.5 trillion dollar trade deficits in goods, and watched nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs disappear or go to other countries.
Trump	1	This crowd is incredible.
Trump	1	I also want to thank your great governor.
Trump	1	When the wind doesn't blow, what do we do?
Trump	1	We're working on NAFTA deal.
Trump	1	We're putting on phenomenal judges.
Trump	1	"Get over here."
Trump	1	I'd like to take the credit for this, but I can't because it's Henry.
Trump	1	We're draining the swamp.
Trump	1	He made a speech in front a few thousand people."
Trump	1	These are brave people.
Trump	1	Four were from another Mid-East -- two Mid-East countries.
Trump	1	We secured... $716 billion to fully rebuild our great American military.
Trump	1	We have great companies coming into our country.
Trump	1	And I said, There's something wrong.
Trump	1	I was with Ron Johnson, a great person, a great senator who loves you.
Trump	1	They were brilliant.
Trump	1	Chuck?
Trump	1	We all share the same heart.
Trump	1	And it was literally 21 years.
Trump	1	Pete.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much.
Trump	1	And she voted for the disaster that we're holding together, we had it defeated.
Trump	1	We called and we had 32,000 people including all of the people outside.
Trump	1	It wasn't a political threat.
Trump	1	Danny Tarkanian, going to be a great congressman.
Trump	1	And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is -- [Laughter] -- it's okay.
Trump	1	And I came off the stage.
Trump	1	If you love your children, you can keep them in the family.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	They're very rich.
Trump	1	We're all here tonight to support an amazing leader and a tremendous champion for this great state, a woman who went to Washington.
Trump	1	Our great Republican members of Congress worked night and day to score this landmark victory.
Trump	1	You know what a globalist is?
Trump	1	And that's happening with a lot of businesses.
Trump	1	And they’re seeing the drugs and they’re seeing the human trafficking.
Trump	1	And Tina Smith is voting against Judge Kavanaugh.
Trump	1	That's great.
Trump	1	But the Chinese market is down 27 percent in the last three or four months, 27.
Trump	1	You know, when people defend me, I defend them.
Trump	1	"Well, we weren't talking about the Supreme Court.
Trump	1	But he does, he loves this state.
Trump	1	Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, won a revolution, and fought to victory in two world wars.
Trump	1	He was a 3, and I gave him a nice shot and a nice little tweak, bing-bing, and he went from 3 to like 20-something.
Trump	1	But we have to change our laws.
Trump	1	Women, women, women!
Trump	1	And you can say what you want, but I think border security and security in general is a great issue for the Republican Party.
Trump	1	Our investment will also support thousands of additional jobs across our nation to assemble these incredible Abrams tanks.
Trump	1	Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.
Trump	1	Two hundred.
Trump	1	Can you believe it?
Trump	1	Remember the tears?
Trump	1	A lot.
Trump	1	Records.
Trump	1	To everyone at Al Asad Air Base, and every American serving overseas, may God bless you, may God protect you, and may God always keep you safe.
Trump	1	I didn't have to go there.
Trump	1	His wife knows I'm telling the truth.
Trump	1	And I have to thank the Republican senators that fought so hard for this because it wasn't easy.
Trump	1	Many, many years, right to try.
Trump	1	There's an electricity like people have not seen since a date 2016 November.
Trump	1	We found the magic wand.
Trump	1	We have to get that passed, Dad.
Trump	1	You watch.
Trump	1	Then she deletes 33,000 e-mails.
Trump	1	And it's not fair.
Trump	1	I came in, and I said that to a group of people that are professionals and have been working with the vets for a long time.
Trump	1	Because I came here, and they said we're closing this plant.
Trump	1	You are taking our country back.
Trump	1	Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, he was in there at the beginning.
Trump	1	So I want to introduce three people that probably you've heard of.
Trump	1	Because we didn't deal with our enemies, we dealt with our friends, and we dealt incompetently.
Trump	1	"Keep America Great."
Trump	1	Now that's a long way short of four and a half billion that we're losing, but I should make it 750.
Trump	1	Taking in billions and billions of dollars in taxes from China.
Trump	1	And another brave and hardened representative, somebody that has helped us all the time: Clay Higgins.
Trump	1	But even I thought that it was maybe a little bit hokey with all the "cuts."
Trump	1	In partnership with the federal government, local law enforcement is also making tremendous, historic strides.
Trump	1	We have the greatest things -- they're looking.
Trump	1	We've started it, we're fixing it and we're building new and we're starting it.
Trump	1	It must be a mile long.
Trump	1	And you know what they were asking, Election Day, "Where did all these people come from?
Trump	1	Just had a big re-election, got a tremendous vote.
Trump	1	And you know what, in the negotiation, Israel will have to pay a higher price because they want a very big thing, but I took it off the table.
Trump	1	In fact, I think he might have lost his Democrat base by doing it.
Trump	1	I looked at the ninth guy, I said, what's wrong with you?
Trump	1	No, no he'll do the acoustic.
Trump	1	But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt.
Trump	1	Secretary Azar has done a fantastic job.
Trump	1	In recent weeks, an elderly homeless woman in New York was allegedly beaten to death by a twice-deported illegal alien that was not supposed to be in this country.
Trump	1	Please, come up.
Trump	1	He suffered needlessly by vicious people, like Feinstein, like -- remember?
Trump	1	That's why we have a lot of Democrats that support us, frankly, we have a lot of the Democrats that aren't crazy.
Trump	1	Let's make it, like, real short."
Trump	1	You understand what that means, I think.
Trump	1	See voted against the thing that we're proud to have started and we're moving along rapidly, the border wall.
Trump	1	We are making America great again, and with your vote in 2020, we will keep America great.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	And many of those people are going to go out and buy a house.
Trump	1	We're going to get rid of catch and release.
Trump	1	Also, Kellyanne Conway.
Trump	1	It came out, the Rasmussen, 51 or 52.
Trump	1	The Democrats are trying to find out, "Who are these people that came out to vote?
Trump	1	It's a winner.
Trump	1	I hope you're happy.
Trump	1	MS-13 gang members from all over the place, come on in -- we have open borders.
Trump	1	We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military, which it needed.
Trump	1	Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this Great American Adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.
Trump	1	That would be nice right, but you know the expression you're inside, so you made it good, realistic.
Trump	1	Number one, by far, it's more important, but number one, they get better fast.
Trump	1	We've created nearly 4 million new jobs since the election and lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps.
Trump	1	We have the greatest.
Trump	1	He's a guy that is real trouble.
Trump	1	Okay, all right, but you know what.
Trump	1	And I don't know that it is or that it isn't, but politically they always say it's the most important thing.
Trump	1	That's not bad though.
Trump	1	And they're going to make high quality panels.
Trump	1	The baby becomes a citizen.
Trump	1	But the people I campaigned, like in Kentucky, Andy Barr, and so many others, they won.
Trump	1	Jackie.
Trump	1	That's some number.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much.
Trump	1	Things that could have been taken care of.
Trump	1	Nobody talks about the injured.
Trump	1	In green.
Trump	1	But we're doing great there now.
Trump	1	Come up here just for a second.
Trump	1	So they call us they didn't want to make a deal with anybody else.
Trump	1	Today, we honor America's cherished farming heritage.
Trump	1	Yeah, that's right.
Trump	1	He will never cut regulations.
Trump	1	And they could have ruined -- they could have ruined -- could have ruined a lesser man.
Trump	1	They're happy because of what we've done and because of how well our country is doing and our economy is doing.
Trump	1	Just relax.
Trump	1	Who thought we would have in just a short period -- not even two years, the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country?
Trump	1	Pennsylvania is the state that rang the Liberty Bell, forged the railroads, and put steel into the spine of our country.
Trump	1	Go home to Mommy.
Trump	1	Thank you, coach.
Trump	1	They all respect what we've done.
Trump	1	Our country has added more than 180,000 people to the workforce, and think of that, through what we've done on a federal basis, you picked up over 180,000 thousand jobs, North Carolina.
Trump	1	Really, really great.
Trump	1	They want the right to vote.
Trump	1	Just says Donald and then you see it's a dead stop.
Trump	1	It's amazing, actually.
Trump	1	And that's why we're so angry when they said that I was supporting Steve Stivers.
Trump	1	Please.
Trump	1	We'll get things that are actually military, 700 billion and 716 billion, we get that.
Trump	1	They won't even be coming up.
Trump	1	Just move it around.
Trump	1	Things go wrong.
Trump	1	And then -- and then we had Florida, and many others.
Trump	1	Earlier this month, we achieved a historic victory for our Constitution and for the rule of law.
Trump	1	Has reached the lowest level in 18 years.
Trump	1	 Thank you, Michael.
Trump	1	332 to 95.
Trump	1	I -- look, I'm just -- you know, there are some Democrats, they're fine.
Trump	1	Vote for Karin.
Trump	1	This is an incredible time for our nation.
Trump	1	And they're coming in, frankly to Michigan, they're coming back, they want to be back to Ohio, to Pennsylvania, to North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and what's the name of this special place?
Trump	1	But I said, "King, we're protecting you.
Trump	1	Bobby Knight.
Trump	1	But I know one thing: I'm going to get other countries to give.
Trump	1	How good is he?
Trump	1	It had nothing to do with financial.
Trump	1	The greatest.
Trump	1	You can't miss him.
Trump	1	We believe that schools should teach our children to be proud of their country and to respect our great American flag.
Trump	1	And, you know, we work with other countries and we work with their energy, and we take their energy, and we buy it, we produce it -- but we don't need to if we don't have to, if we don't want to.
Trump	1	Maxine Waters.
Trump	1	And you know to me very important, we really had Obamacare defeated, but unfortunately, you could really say, anybody that didn't vote is really the deciding vote.
Trump	1	One of the questions that I was asked when we said -- Thank you.
Trump	1	I also want to thank two members of my administration who are doing tremendous work: the head of ATF Thomas Brandon and the Acting DEA Administrator Uttam Dhillon.
Trump	1	They're tough.
Trump	1	We wanted to be bipartisan.
Trump	1	I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran deal, and I also recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Trump	1	So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 -- and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted.
Trump	1	Every president, for many decades, said they were going to do that, and I understand really why.
Trump	1	Forty-four years.
Trump	1	But we have a great cabinet.
Trump	1	We are replacing one-sided, unfair trade deals.
Trump	1	They said, "No, no, no, no, you cannot do that.
Trump	1	The Opportunity Zones -- and it's starting to be seen, and it's starting to be written about -- it's a great achievement for Tim Scott.
Trump	1	Abrams voted in favor of allowing illegal aliens to receive public benefits.
Trump	1	Hello, Minnesota.
Trump	1	Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.
Trump	1	But I will say, we have to get out tomorrow, and we have to elect a Republican Congress.
Trump	1	We secured $716 billion, and last year $700 billion, to fully rebuild our great United States military.
Trump	1	Women are doing incredibly.
Trump	1	And a man I know, who I don't like, a businessman very, very, very successful businessman, one of the most successful.
Trump	1	When I realized what they were all calling about, I said, tell them I'll call them back in a week.
Trump	1	Pennsylvania will go to Hillary Clinton, unfortunately for them, didn't work out that.
Trump	1	But nobody has done more than we've done in the first two years and not even close.
Trump	1	[Audience cheers] Thank you.
Trump	1	We're doing it piecemeal and it's working out just fine.
Trump	1	Jim just doesn't stop.
Trump	1	We want to do all of the things that you know about and we're going to get it done.
Trump	1	I didn't press it initially because I wanted them to help us with North Korea and they have, and they have, and we're doing well with North Korea.
Trump	1	[Audience member calls out] Thank you, darling.
Trump	1	Wages are going up.
Trump	1	So Henry was for me from the beginning.
Trump	1	No longer.
Trump	1	That's what will happen.
Trump	1	We were paying, essentially, for most of NATO.
Trump	1	You know how many people have come up to me and said, "Thank you very much for getting rid of the individual mandate"?
Trump	1	Sounds like a big Florida State or Florida football game.
Trump	1	They've been working on that one for 45 years, we got it passed.
Trump	1	That's who we're doing, and that's what we're doing.
Trump	1	They pay us a small percentage.
Trump	1	Anybody else would be very happy.
Trump	1	It didn't get much news, folks, but you know it.
Trump	1	I don't think -- as much as I love "Make America Great Again," I don't know that we can carry it forward, because people will say, "Well, what did we do for the last four years?
Trump	1	Our opponents have been on a relentless campaign to obstruct, resist, demolish, defame, and destroy.
Trump	1	You have to see what they built.
Trump	1	 Wow.
Trump	1	I mean, one-year expensing, I think, is one of the biggest things.
Trump	1	It's time to come together for the people of Panama City, for the people of Florida, for the people of our country.
Trump	1	What a campaign that was, right?
Trump	1	Three percent.
Trump	1	MAGA country.
Trump	1	I meant it.
Trump	1	Nobody thought that would be possible.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	Would have cost us trillions and trillions of dollars.
Trump	1	And we believe that all Americans share one magnificent destiny.
Trump	1	But only two percent come back.
Trump	1	They are enforcing new sanctions, working with us to identify and track terrorist networks, and taking more responsibility for fighting terrorism and extremism in their own region.
Trump	1	It's not a good picture.
Trump	1	We're going to do… And, you know, we've done most of what we said.
Trump	1	The last undefeated college basketball team, it's amazing.
Trump	1	The whole country is watching the great state of West Virginia.
Trump	1	Schools, health care.
Trump	1	Thank you, Tracy, and your entire team for everything that you do to support realtors around the country.
Trump	1	They gave them 1.8 in order to have a terrible deal.
Trump	1	We don't have a climate where you had zero interest rates.
Trump	1	And immediately we look at that person and we say, you're fired.
Trump	1	And it goes the other way, too.
Trump	1	A bricklayer who has worked here for 36 years.
Trump	1	We are great Americans.
Trump	1	Look at Harley Davidson.
Trump	1	And he just said, you're going to win.
Trump	1	Ninety-five percent of U.S. manufacturers are optimistic about the future.
Trump	1	Anybody in this front row, they've been here for many hours.
Trump	1	But to continue this incredible momentum, to protect your state and your country, you need to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate.
Trump	1	And the reason is, I guess they get a little bit complacent.
Trump	1	That's West Virginia.
Trump	1	Get out of here.
Trump	1	For years, we only defended the borders of foreign countries.
Trump	1	We withdrew from the horrible one-sided Iran deal, and that's gonna turn out to be very good.
Trump	1	And on my direction, the Pentagon is working to create a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces.
Trump	1	It was a year before.
Trump	1	Nobody ever asked.
Trump	1	Zero.
Trump	1	Many years, it was very, very close.
Trump	1	And he honestly says, nobody ever asked.
Trump	1	He's going to represent you for a long time, and he's going to represent you well.
Trump	1	I don't want to use our military.
Trump	1	Promises made, promises kept.
Trump	1	Every day of my Presidency ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens and we are either throwing them behind bars or throwing them the hell out of our country.
Trump	1	You have saved America.
Trump	1	Now he's in Washington.
Trump	1	It will be gridlock.
Trump	1	How do you get to Australia?
Trump	1	The first time I've ever heard it.
Trump	1	The USMCA is a tremendous victory for Indiana farmers, manufacturers, and dairy producers.
Trump	1	Well, NAFTA is going to be a thing of the past.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And what did I say, Dan?
Trump	1	But, Mr. President, keep going.
Trump	1	John.
Trump	1	They moved them to other countries, they sold back the product with no taxes, nothing, you lost your jobs, we lost revenue and nobody even apologized except me.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	We don't worry too much about the globalists.
Trump	1	I have to do it.
Trump	1	I don't get it.
Trump	1	[Laughter] A low-IQ individual.
Trump	1	Now, early voting is now underway.
Trump	1	We had a fantastic meeting with Chairman Kim, and it seems to be going very well.
Trump	1	You knew a long time ago, didn't you, huh?
Trump	1	Joe Donnelly has been rated the least effective Democrat in the United States Senate.
Trump	1	America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Trump	1	They're not attacking construction workers for Trump.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Last year, a record 73 percent of newly employed workers were people out of the workforce who were coming off the sidelines.
Trump	1	They don't want to do that.
Trump	1	But just remember the Democrats were totally opposed to this, folks.
Trump	1	I mean, we won -- we won states by more than 42 points, can you believe it?
Trump	1	We all share the same home.
Trump	1	[Laughter] One week?
Trump	1	We defend the 2nd Amendment.
Trump	1	And that goes for military protection also, that goes for military protection also where we are getting ripped.
Trump	1	So what we want to do is we want to elect more Republicans so that we can deliver on all of the things I'm talking about.
Trump	1	But we don't want to help other people that are rich and not have them reimburse us.
Trump	1	And, remember, early voting in Arizona is underway right now.
Trump	1	[Applause] And you've heard me say, when they said $350 billion, I said, "You mean $350 million."
Trump	1	They take care of the baby, they wrap the baby beautifully.
Trump	1	We passed a landmark V.A.
Trump	1	The bankers were being crushed and they were being threatened.
Trump	1	Senator Rob Portman.
Trump	1	About time.
Trump	1	That's a big stat.
Trump	1	Great people.
Trump	1	Chris, please.
Trump	1	He goes "and beautiful."
Trump	1	You can right your wrong.
Trump	1	So that's a good feeling.
Trump	1	I just don't understand the thinking.
Trump	1	They don't believe in what the people in this room believe -- that I can tell you.
Trump	1	How do you figure that, resist?
Trump	1	They said he is the Energizer bunny.
Trump	1	You're not letting me down.
Trump	1	They could steal.
Trump	1	Coasties plunge from helicopters, and barrel through pouring rain and crashing waves to save American lives.
Trump	1	Under our new tax plan, which lowers rates for small businesses and doubles the tax child credit -- so important, that child tax credit.
Trump	1	I want to change it.
Trump	1	It's very interesting, I just pick this out.
Trump	1	Where's Brad?
Trump	1	You're the smartest, you're the hardest working, you're paying your taxes.
Trump	1	And I never saw it because I don’t follow the guy.
Trump	1	He goes, no.
Trump	1	Five or six-thousand?
Trump	1	They want to cut people up into little pieces because it's more painful.
Trump	1	I mean we've rebuilt -- we really started that about eight months ago, really heavy started it.
Trump	1	So hopefully you're going to remember it.
Trump	1	And the vast majority of the people, not only in this room but all over this country oppose the Democrat platform of mass migration, high taxes, high crime, late-term abortion and later than late-term abortion, hoaxes and delusions.
Trump	1	And more Americans are working today than ever before.
Trump	1	I said I was coming back, and I'm back.
Trump	1	[Applause] He got hit hard.
Trump	1	He led the Georgia team to a national championship.
Trump	1	They have nobody.
Trump	1	Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs, and we want no caravans, thank you.
Trump	1	What do you think?
Trump	1	You're going to be so happy.
Trump	1	We're going to dredge the channel to Lake Erie.
Trump	1	Except you know they're torn.
Trump	1	Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob.
Trump	1	That's not bad.
Trump	1	We won't talk about it anymore, because I want them to do it.
Trump	1	The crazy attempt by the Democrat party and the fake news media right back there -- And the deep state to overturn the results of the 2016 election have failed, the greatest election that we've had in a long time may be right from the beginning.
Trump	1	You get cheaper premiums in much lower deductibles.
Trump	1	We will always be successful at what we do.
Trump	1	This is one of the most important elections of our time.
Trump	1	I said, what about us?
Trump	1	The first to be passed, on time, in over 30 years.
Trump	1	Is that true?
Trump	1	Made a lot of people very happy.
Trump	1	I love Border Patrol.
Trump	1	If we stay away from that subject we're going to lose.
Trump	1	We have to get it done.
Trump	1	I mean, it's not that far, right?
Trump	1	We want to do that.
Trump	1	And don't worry, we'll be on the ballot in two years, and we will do a landslide like you haven't -- like you wouldn't believe.
Trump	1	 Wow.
Trump	1	Good?
Trump	1	We will make America strong again.
Trump	1	We're going to have an incredible expansion.
Trump	1	Representative and Mrs. Greg.
Trump	1	She thinks that people with the same skin color, all need to think the same.
Trump	1	Together we strive.
Trump	1	And the young aide looked at me and he said, Mr. President, these liberal pundits, the haters, but they're so angry because you've upset their entire way of life.
Trump	1	Greg helped a lot on that one, and I appreciate it, and so did Steve.
Trump	1	That's socialism.
Trump	1	He voted yes for failed Obamacare.
Trump	1	It's pretty great.
Trump	1	It was packed with thousands of people outside.
Trump	1	No, seriously, I thought they were joking, right?
Trump	1	We are putting America first, for the first time in a long time -- longer than anyone can remember.
Trump	1	Pocahontas -- they always want me to apologize for saying that and I hereby -- oh no, I want to apologize.
Trump	1	And I think something is going to happen.
Trump	1	But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't.
Trump	1	Now, when I ran, they were all saying, "You can't say 3 percent."
Trump	1	[Applause] And I said, I think I'm doing well, but they're showing me a little down in Ohio.
Trump	1	And yesterday, we were in Georgia.
Trump	1	We'll do them quietly.
Trump	1	You kill a cop and it's called the death penalty, okay?
Trump	1	And I looked at him today, I said, "You failed."
Trump	1	I saw them back there.
Trump	1	They never mention all the people that have been so horrifically injured, where they lose arms and legs and everything else.
Trump	1	We're losing that with these crazy loco people.
Trump	1	I said, "Boy, that's -- " Do you know how low 4.0 is?
Trump	1	Lou Barletta.
Trump	1	And this is some tank plant.
Trump	1	They said manufacturing jobs would never come back.
Trump	1	I just got -- I'm so proud."
Trump	1	Sergeant Celis entered the building, engaged in a vicious shooting attack, and captured the criminal before anyone was hurt -- which was incredible, actually.
Trump	1	And you know what?
Trump	1	They now go out and see a doctor.
Trump	1	It's not -- it's not fair.
Trump	1	Nobody has ever seen anything like it.
Trump	1	And by the way, we have many women here -- remember, I won women -- remember how... We have many women here.
Trump	1	They said, Why are you calling?
Trump	1	Antifa.
Trump	1	That was a beautiful time.
Trump	1	When the radical Democrats get control, they will try to erase every single thing that we've achieved.
Trump	1	We have a doctor, doctor in the house, please.
Trump	1	It's choice of going out and finding a different job that they like better.
Trump	1	There wouldn't be enough room.
Trump	1	It's going to be a mess.
Trump	1	[Applause] And this is the room right here.
Trump	1	Thank you, fellas.
Trump	1	Even if you look at the pipelines -- immediately upon taking office, I let the pipelines go -- Keystone, you know, both of them.
Trump	1	His hand was shaking.
Trump	1	I said, "Richard, lighten up.
Trump	1	If you remember the previous administration said manufacturing jobs... Other than that, you like them very much, right?
Trump	1	 Do we have a great country or what?
Trump	1	That is why you must vote Republican on Election Day, and you have to go out and vote.
Trump	1	The center just said this, this wasn't just a one-time, one-year, unusual thing or anomaly.
Trump	1	You look at Michigan, what's going on in Michigan, where they're coming back so fast -- but they're coming back to Ohio.
Trump	1	And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: "Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that."
Trump	1	More than one-third of the steel jobs -- and now it was getting up to about 62 percent -- were vanquished, they were gone.
Trump	1	It works.
Trump	1	We have 400 people.
Trump	1	I said let's just go through and it does.
Trump	1	Thank you, Kevin.
Trump	1	Vote for all of them.
Trump	1	Where's Bill?
Trump	1	Come up, Randy.
Trump	1	They don't do a damn thing.
Trump	1	We will give school choice to millions of underserved children who are trapped in failing schools and failing school system.
Trump	1	This is the first time it's no longer -- it was a 49-51 issue for many, many -- for decades.
Trump	1	That's right.
Trump	1	"Please get us the emails.
Trump	1	And I handed it to them.
Trump	1	[Laughter] But I was there, I don't know, for a number of months, through Christmas.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Blaine Luetkemeyer... Vicky Hartzler... a man who did an auction recently.
Trump	1	Incredible.
Trump	1	That will never be reported by the fake news.
Trump	1	And did we ever help you -- hey, did, honestly, you know we were here a lot.
Trump	1	I'm sorry.
Trump	1	It works, and it was meant for problems like Chicago.
Trump	1	That doesn't mean the other countries are thrilled with me.
Trump	1	The Republican party.
Trump	1	Stand up, Mike.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	What they did was terrible.
Trump	1	They gave them 1.8 billion in cash.
Trump	1	But women want security.
Trump	1	You could do anything.
Trump	1	They're getting phenomenal reviews.
Trump	1	Coach Lou Holtz.
Trump	1	But these kids and these people come from rough places And I'll tell you what, some of them said, "We've never lived like this before."
Trump	1	We're lifting millions of our citizens -- and you know this -- from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity.
Trump	1	Thank you, Virginia.
Trump	1	Can you believe these people?
Trump	1	He said, "Two months."
Trump	1	So were your congressmen.
Trump	1	But if it does happen, it's your fault, because you didn't go out to vote.
Trump	1	[Audience Chants Build the Wall] So we've started the wall.
Trump	1	And one of these people said, he said he's going to give them a Rolls-Royce.
Trump	1	With that being said, we're moving so fast, nobody could even believe it.
Trump	1	In the meantime, they're committing crime in our country.
Trump	1	We're doing very well.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And I fire a bad cop.
Trump	1	He was a great businessman.
Trump	1	Another phony -- so a deal -- I would fire a person so fast if he ever touches my desk.
Trump	1	He defended your borders.
Trump	1	I wish they became so activist in their own countries.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions.
Trump	1	They don't want these people coming in to our country.
Trump	1	And I have to tell you, we had three seats, even four seats that were so close, we almost won in areas that a lot of people say don't bother contesting.
Trump	1	 Well, first of all, at ease.
Trump	1	You see where they're surging and our great people are able to easily handle it.
Trump	1	Thank you, fellas.
Trump	1	Our immigration laws are a laughingstock all over the world.
Trump	1	We worship God.
Trump	1	But those are great people outside and I apologize.
Trump	1	If I did, you would have been out of here a long time ago, because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal.
Trump	1	Glenn Grothman.
Trump	1	And we are standing up to China's chronic trading abuses and theft of intellectual properties and so many other things that they've done to us.
Trump	1	And the Democrats don't want to change it because they know its chaos and a disaster and they think that's good, but I think it's good for us because I think they overplayed their hand.
Trump	1	These drugs destroy the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and 70,000 Americans a year die from these drugs.
Trump	1	But you're there now, we are protecting your money.
Trump	1	It was like two sentences."
Trump	1	Democrat backed policies have left our borders overrun our detention facilities overwhelmed as fast as we build them.
Trump	1	But she's got superdelegates that were handed to her.
Trump	1	We'd go -- I'll never forget -- we went to Michigan, final stop.
Trump	1	I mean, this is a guarantee.
Trump	1	In the last two years of the previous administration, farm income plummeted by more than $30 billion, and agricultural exports dropped by over $22 billion.
Trump	1	I want to show the crowds.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	And you know what they want to do?
Trump	1	I'm like okay saying that, Steve?
Trump	1	And I've directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating a sixth branch of the United States armed forces called the Space Force.
Trump	1	A man who came to see me speak in Pennsylvania, and he said to me -- been long-term congressman, loves this state.
Trump	1	Travel ban.
Trump	1	Where is he?
Trump	1	I could have told you that a long time ago.
Trump	1	But I went to President Xi, and he agreed to do it.
Trump	1	Where are you, Mike?
Trump	1	He's a smart guy, and he's a great guy.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	The lawless state of our Southern Border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans.
Trump	1	You know that as long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, we will not fail.
Trump	1	Where is he?
Trump	1	Great nations do not fight endless wars.
Trump	1	That's a disaster if you've ever seen it.
Trump	1	And in my direction, The Pentagon is working hard to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the space force.That's very exciting.
Trump	1	They love our country.
Trump	1	Politics is a mean game, isn't it?
Trump	1	They sacrifice your security.
Trump	1	I don't see him deal with Vladimir Putin, and we have good relationships with them and many others, except now we're no longer the suckers.
Trump	1	In Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, OK?
Trump	1	Last year, we provided $90 million to prevent youth substance abuse, and I signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act -- the largest-ever legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in our nation’s history.
Trump	1	But it's a great honor to have picked two great people.
Trump	1	I also withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, and unfortunately, just today I felt compelled to authorize new sanctions on Iran's iron, steel, aluminum and copper industries, because I hope to be able, at some point, maybe it won't happen, possibly won't, to sit down and work out a fair deal, we're not looking to hurt anybody.
Trump	1	You'll like this.
Trump	1	They're saying, "Let's negotiate, please.
Trump	1	Sorry about this, women, but the employment rate has reached the lowest level in only 65 years.
Trump	1	And you see that just by this crowd.
Trump	1	By Gregg Jarrett.
Trump	1	And all of you, as Americans, you find a home for the ones that you love the most.
Trump	1	And there are very few governors that I could have said, "Good luck, you're going to build one of the largest operations in the world -- over 20 million feet.
Trump	1	A vote for any Democrat this November is a vote to put the radical Democrats in charge of the House, the Senate, and every congressional committee.
Trump	1	You got a lake snakes a lot.
Trump	1	I did it, I did it yesterday."
Trump	1	I don't think there's ever been anything like it.
Trump	1	You know what I'm talking about.
Trump	1	It's already.
Trump	1	Made a lot of progress.
Trump	1	They have since begun the Zero Left initiative to help families get rid of excess painkillers.
Trump	1	At our urging, we are finally starting to see some progress on better forest management.
Trump	1	It is not up to the media or the pundits to decide your fate.
Trump	1	Get up, bing.
Trump	1	And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem.
Trump	1	In every action we take, we are defending American safety and treasuring the extraordinary -- I mean, we're just helping as much as we can the extraordinary men and women who protect our communities.
Trump	1	We came to Al Asad to share our eternal gratitude for everything you do to keep America safe, strong, and free.
Trump	1	It's not me.
Trump	1	For decades, Washington politicians allowed foreign countries to plunder our jobs, shutter our factories, and decimate our industries.
Trump	1	When the Commandant of the Marine Corps came to visit his hospital, Sergeant Nashton had to feel the General's collar; he wanted to feel his four stars.
Trump	1	So it's not like, "Oh, gee, I want to protect my friend."
Trump	1	He was treated very unfairly.
Trump	1	And together, we will make America wealthy again.
Trump	1	It doesn't matter -- it only matters on November 6th, when those votes are tallied up and counted.
Trump	1	And then you have a young guy, Buttigieg, Buttigieg.
Trump	1	Yeah, I have proof.
Trump	1	I said, "Whatever happened to diplomacy?"
Trump	1	That happens a little bit, you know.
Trump	1	This was a movement.
Trump	1	Thank you very much, Eric.
Trump	1	He loves you and he's been with us from the beginning and we've had a lot of people with us.
Trump	1	Doctor?
Trump	1	We can't let this happen.
Trump	1	I said, David, they want to spend $1.1 billion to build the embassy in Jerusalem.
Trump	1	And I know they're all winning big and all that stuff.
Trump	1	Going to have a big, big surprise in six months.
Trump	1	It's not going to happen, folks.
Trump	1	He didn't just say, "Gee, I was in the service."
Trump	1	Remember the teams, the Yankees, George Steinbrenner.
Trump	1	And -- and it is hard.
Trump	1	I don't know about the leak Remember?
Trump	1	We actually had a rally in Washington, D.C., together.
Trump	1	They stick together, better than the Republicans.
Trump	1	I was called by every country I was called by countries.
Trump	1	We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any other administration, no matter how long it went.
Trump	1	Think that's okay?
Trump	1	Do you know what that is?
Trump	1	Sounds so beautiful.
Trump	1	Do they ever tell you that?
Trump	1	We got states that they didn't think about.
Trump	1	So everyone's coming back in.
Trump	1	Which I think that's like a poll.
Trump	1	Everybody.
Trump	1	She fought for you so hard and I saw it.
Trump	1	We won Florida quickly.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much.
Trump	1	And it doesn't flow as easily, you know, it does when you speak it sounds nicer as the Democratic Party, but you know, we're talking about people that want tax increases, they want open borders.
Trump	1	You know, some industries we can do without.
Trump	1	We must pursue peace without fear, hope without despair, and security without apology.
Trump	1	And I just want to thank you.
Trump	1	And that's a vote for safe communities, strong borders, and Kentucky values.
Trump	1	And I will tell you, though, that area in Pennsylvania and all of Pennsylvania and all other states -- they're energized because I made a speech there two nights before, and I'll tell you what -- that crowd was -- they were going.
Trump	1	He's actually with my wife over the hospital, a hospital that's so beautiful.
Trump	1	And, by the way, Canada -- they like to talk.
Trump	1	Think about it.
Trump	1	And then I have three more pages -- two more pages just like this.
Trump	1	Each of you is a national treasure.
Trump	1	So I think they can afford to pay us, right, for defense, and they will, and you know what, they will.
Trump	1	Connelly.
Trump	1	And I went to my people, and I said, do this.
Trump	1	But to achieve that victory from Columbus, to Cleveland to Cincinnati, we have to work every day from now to November.
Trump	1	Then I say, hi, you know what -- you ever do this?
Trump	1	You come back, darling, OK?
Trump	1	What a shame.
Trump	1	So the United States is now the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world.
Trump	1	 Hello, West Virginia.
Trump	1	Hey, you go to the best schools.
Trump	1	Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving.
Trump	1	It was good.
Trump	1	[Applause, Laughter] In fact, their only policy was that Donald Trump is a bad guy, he's a bad person.
Trump	1	You know, that they weren't -- in other words, that they will fair.
Trump	1	Can't do that.
Trump	1	We opened up ANWR.
Trump	1	Great marks, great schools, the best everything, the best of everything.
Trump	1	Although, I must say, with your past leaders, you did not always win.
Trump	1	I'll tell you what, if he's your next senator, you're going to have no more problems.
Trump	1	The lowest unemployment, the lowest rate of poverty.
Trump	1	And if our opponent had won and the Democrats had won, they would've put more regulations on.
Trump	1	They spied on our campaign.
Trump	1	Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
Trump	1	The worst part of Obamacare, and we're working very hard.
Trump	1	No more lotteries.
Trump	1	And I know he has a great future.
Trump	1	And then you have this Governor in Virginia, you saw that.
Trump	1	Okay?
Trump	1	"I think they stole the election."
Trump	1	So we're in a little dispute with China.
Trump	1	So, I can now understand, because I always said, "Why wouldn't they do it, why?
Trump	1	With your help, Ohio, we'll carry the hopes and dreams of the American people all the way to victory this November.
Trump	1	[Audience chants Build that wall] We will.
Trump	1	And he said, sir, Mr. President, thank you so much for saving our country.
Trump	1	Remember that?
Trump	1	This will be an election, frankly, of common sense, right?
Trump	1	I traveled to this very state to sign an executive order, declaring that we will live by two simple rules, "Buy American and Hire American", right here in Wisconsin.
Trump	1	You know all about that, except he never went to Vietnam.
Trump	1	Even Chuck Schumer said, yeah, it's a good deal.
Trump	1	In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one.
Trump	1	They understand that.
Trump	1	You know, let's get rid of law enforcement, let's get rid of our military, let's not take care of our vets -- all of these things, let's not build a wall.
Trump	1	"Mr. President, congratulations on the growth of the United States.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	When you say off the record, that's a very -- it's not a legal term, but it's a term of honor.
Trump	1	Would you mind if we didn't stop?"
Trump	1	But under the previous administration, this tank factory -- the last of its kind anywhere in the Western Hemisphere -- came very close to shutting down.
Trump	1	All he had was Trump.
Trump	1	Every single one.
Trump	1	We will never give in.
Trump	1	[Audience Calls Out Lou] Also at stake in this election is Medicare.
Trump	1	Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
Trump	1	Get out of here."
Trump	1	Sounds so nice, right?
Trump	1	He now sits alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom.
Trump	1	You watch.
Trump	1	Great brain and great heart.
Trump	1	Then I watched the fake news and they said, "We have breaking news.
Trump	1	[Applause] With a great, great wife by the way.
Trump	1	You know sometimes when they don't give you the money, you have to make it cheaper, not going to happen, but it's going well.
Trump	1	And right before I came into office, our nation was being signed up for a one-sided single sell out like you've never seen of the American worker, and I said it's not going to happen.
Trump	1	It was a number that everybody said was not reachable.
Trump	1	They have to treat us fairly.
Trump	1	I wanna say to Dean, look, he's done so well that I can't imagine anything bad happening but you have to always fight hard.
Trump	1	They come through the Southern border.
Trump	1	Last year, I came right here to Iowa and announced that my administration would open up the sale of E15 all year around.
Trump	1	He is tough.
Trump	1	We won two years ago.
Trump	1	Governor Ron.
Trump	1	So don't listen to what Claire says.
Trump	1	More than anybody else done in, you know, in eight years in a 16-year term.
Trump	1	And it's had an amazing impact.
Trump	1	One thing, if they let me really do my thing, we'd get it back, but I have to be a little bit politically correct by saying, "It's OK if we lose 20 billion with a country."
Trump	1	Donald Trump has won the State of Florida, right?
Trump	1	We make the best in the world.
Trump	1	Thank you doctor.
Trump	1	Our country won't be able to afford it.
Trump	1	And they were smart.
Trump	1	One of the greatest nights in the history of our country, but one, far less importantly, one of the greatest nights in the history of television.
Trump	1	Michael Waltz.
Trump	1	And we -- all of us -- are living by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.
Trump	1	Put it up for a vote.
Trump	1	More Americans are working today than ever before.
Trump	1	It's true.
Trump	1	You both do.
Trump	1	They don't talk about it.
Trump	1	[Audience members calls out] Only in Wisconsin, right.
Trump	1	I think -- that it's what I want.
Trump	1	Women, by the way, what do they want?
Trump	1	Get out there.
Trump	1	Politician.
Trump	1	They went to the bathroom.
Trump	1	Do we have time?
Trump	1	A friend of mine, who employs a lot of people, a very successful guy.
Trump	1	Did you see -- did you see four weeks ago when Pfizer and Novartis and other drug companies raised the prices of their drugs very, very substantially?
Trump	1	This is more fun.
Trump	1	Big, beautiful car companies, because we like the cars when they're made here, not when they're made in other countries.
Trump	1	He's going to be a justice.
Trump	1	We passed the largest package of tax cuts in the history of our country.
Trump	1	This is a very important moment.
Trump	1	Thanks, Tim.
Trump	1	Scott?
Trump	1	Since Election Day, we've created 4.5 million new jobs.
Trump	1	Last year, coal exports were up 92 percent compared to 2016, 92 percent, do you believe that?
Trump	1	And he was screaming and ranting and raving.
Trump	1	Not because it's not right, but because they don't want to give Trump any victory.
Trump	1	I was in China and I was making a speech and I was saying how bad it is, how unfairly we're treated and I'm in front of thousands of people from China, and I could see the mood was getting dark and I have President Xi over here and I realized I was going point after point, how bad it is for us how good it is for them.
Trump	1	Fake news.
Trump	1	But... [Laughter] ...
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	We will never back down.
Trump	1	You never know.
Trump	1	And the fact is, illegal immigration is a heartbreaking human tragedy.
Trump	1	That's happening.
Trump	1	[Applause] I got a call from Mark Burnett, he did The Apprentice.
Trump	1	Great job.
Trump	1	They -- it doesn't matter what, even a hoax like they tried to pull off with Judge Kavanaugh, they stick together -- or the Russian hoax with the election.
Trump	1	Nearly 250 years ago, a volunteer army of farmers and shopkeepers, blacksmiths, merchants, and militiamen risked life and limb to secure American liberty and self-government.
Trump	1	That was such a big thing.
Trump	1	The most unsafe parts of the country.
Trump	1	I said, "No, I'm going to run for President."
Trump	1	This is the state of country music, of Nashville legends we love -- we love those legends -- and of Memphis blues.
Trump	1	How about I tell this, because, you know, being a builder, we can all talk as friends.
Trump	1	South Korea did a great job, but they didn't have people who's gonna go all of a sudden.
Trump	1	You going to call China, please send us some steel?
Trump	1	He said, sir, they just don't care.
Trump	1	You're smarter than they are, you have more money than they are, you have better jobs than they do, you'rethe elite.
Trump	1	Claire McCaskill promised to represent the people of Missouri, but she broke that promise and joined radical Democrats in Washington.
Trump	1	"No, no, no, I came from Europe."
Trump	1	It's not -- said somebody could go in.
Trump	1	Our Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, laid out a clear agenda for reform, but despite reported and repeated warnings, no action at all was taken.
Trump	1	Nope."
Trump	1	Their dreams are our dreams.
Trump	1	It's all in motion.
Trump	1	And the Democrats want to get rid of these people.
Trump	1	The most incredible record.
Trump	1	He works harder than anybody.
Trump	1	And we also signed a great new deal with South Korea and the farmers are going to be benefiting there too.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	I said, "Oh, I'm so smart."
Trump	1	I can't spend a billion dollars on building an embassy.
Trump	1	But this little tiny part of specialty market, it got you.
Trump	1	I say, "Where is the Merry Christmas?"
Trump	1	This is the new Democrat platform for the -- and I don't want to talk them out of it.
Trump	1	You want a pardon for murder?
Trump	1	You have no idea what I'm going through on this stage.
Trump	1	And I said, You know, if they sit, it's probably better for me, because every once in a while, they'll stand.
Trump	1	And oftentimes, they'll keep the cameras low.
Trump	1	And by the way, she may give us a couple of quickie votes, you know, before the election.
Trump	1	You know.
Trump	1	They said, "We're going to do it.
Trump	1	He's not doing the job.
Trump	1	I can tell you.
Trump	1	But wait 'til you see what happens over the next couple of weeks.
Trump	1	People.
Trump	1	More than 30 states now allow teachers that are highly trained -- highly trained, talented people -- to carry guns in the classroom to protect themselves and to protect their students, who they love.
Trump	1	And they'll have women taped -- their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape.
Trump	1	Talk to our president.
Trump	1	We're going around at the opening.
Trump	1	I didn't pay $1.8 billion.
Trump	1	You have only one choice Ron DeSantis for governor.
Trump	1	And just so you don't feel too lonely, they're moving the plants back into Ohio also.
Trump	1	And he was the first one that told me.
Trump	1	Our farmers are happy, everybody's happy.
Trump	1	I mean, the problem we have -- is that you have a very hostile group.
Trump	1	It's something nobody talks about, but it's something that a lot of people respect -- and it wasn't easy.
Trump	1	In fact, you know the way, if it's close, they have to take hours and hours and hours, right?
Trump	1	And the numbers are way down.
Trump	1	China's been taking hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year out of our country for many years.
Trump	1	I said, "What else?"
Trump	1	Since the election, we have created 5.3 million new jobs, including more than a half a million new manufacturing jobs.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Judah's family braced for the worst.
Trump	1	But I'll tell you what I'm really proud of now.
Trump	1	God bless you.
Trump	1	And did you see what happened on Friday?
Trump	1	A majority of House Democrats have already sponsored a socialist takeover of healthcare.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	When we charge them, you can call it a mirror tax.
Trump	1	Give me a break I'll.
Trump	1	It's very simple.
Trump	1	Japan.
Trump	1	It's commonsense.
Trump	1	[Applause] That was not easy.
Trump	1	Since my election, we've picked up in worth $11.7 trillion.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Obama's economy?
Trump	1	And we were way up.
Trump	1	I'll be there.
Trump	1	And he's been with us right from the beginning.
Trump	1	But you're going to know in 12 months instead of in 20 years, at the end of 20 years you start off as a young man or woman and now you're getting ready to retire and they're getting ready to vote on your project, right, whatever the hell it may be.
Trump	1	We could do great.
Trump	1	You know what the phrase is, right?
Trump	1	We will do it all with American hands and American heart and American pride.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] Sick.
Trump	1	His opponent is a far-left Democrat, you know that, who wants to massively raise your taxes.
Trump	1	That's a pretty popular term and a pretty great group.
Trump	1	You saw it the other day.
Trump	1	They have become the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, witch hunts, and delusions.
Trump	1	She loves your state.
Trump	1	Oh, yes."
Trump	1	We will not let up.
Trump	1	And we have created new options to help Americans purchase affordable health plans all across state lines.
Trump	1	He's going to vote on making American great again, which soon...
Trump	1	So they said, We didn't win by as much as we were supposed to.
Trump	1	Where is Sonny?
Trump	1	But I like him.
Trump	1	But the state didn't know him really as much.
Trump	1	It's the highest approval rating that this country has ever had by the people that create jobs namely, the manufacturers.
Trump	1	It means you're making more money than you've ever made before.
Trump	1	We're not going to send weak people to take care of MS-13.
Trump	1	You know, a year and a half ago, they said I was an interloper.
Trump	1	You can have it.
Trump	1	We're proud of it.
Trump	1	Whoever you are, I love you.
Trump	1	All American citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who work hard to come into our country who study, who wait in line sometimes for 10 years, and who respect our laws and follow the rules, they deserve a government that is loyal to them.
Trump	1	Did anyone ever hear of Air Force One?
Trump	1	And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong.
Trump	1	[Applause] Going to be fantastic.
Trump	1	They didn't know what the hell happened.
Trump	1	It was a mess.
Trump	1	But that was the greatest movement in the history of our country.
Trump	1	And I'm telling you, the people of Indiana, they went crazy.
Trump	1	Look at what's going on in California.
Trump	1	We've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to make progress.
Trump	1	It's already open, it's already open.
Trump	1	Nancy Pelosi... Can you imagine?
Trump	1	You've got to shoot it.
Trump	1	Thank you to the women.
Trump	1	And it's only one of many things that I promised.
Trump	1	You know that.
Trump	1	You know, I've said it a lot -- history of any country.
Trump	1	They're gone.
Trump	1	So we have to get a lot smarter.
Trump	1	Thank you, Kevin, very much.
Trump	1	Let's make it really good for them.
Trump	1	So we're setting records like never before.
Trump	1	They had one case where somebody stole a half a million dollars.
Trump	1	She's doing a great job as first lady, I will tell you.
Trump	1	But I want to say, and we have to do that because it has to be balanced, it has to be fair.
Trump	1	Does anybody want to talk about farms and farming?
Trump	1	And in a short period of time, as soon as we get some pipelines opened in Texas, we'll be able to almost double it.
Trump	1	We are almost twice the size of the next largest economy.
Trump	1	We will never back down.
Trump	1	People like him.
Trump	1	And they say, "Let's change to prevent defense."
Trump	1	I recently announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst trade deals, with an incredible, brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
Trump	1	They're going to raid your Medicare to pay for socialism.
Trump	1	And it's also a great deal for our country.
Trump	1	 Wow, this is great.
Trump	1	Thank you, Doctor.
Trump	1	By the way, that is a lot of fake news back there, that's a lot.
Trump	1	You know he's like, even if he didn't want to do it, he said that to me.
Trump	1	Because toughness is the thing that they most fear.
Trump	1	The Democrat plan would destroy Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for 1.4 million Texas seniors who depend on it.
Trump	1	I mean, honestly, are these people funny?
Trump	1	They have done an incredible job.
Trump	1	Here with us today is Alex Elswick and his mom -- wonderful mom -- Shelley.
Trump	1	And the commentator looks at him and goes, "You know he's winning, don't you?"
Trump	1	And Choice -- for year and years, decades, they wanted to get Choice.
Trump	1	Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10 year old girl, Grace Ee-line.
Trump	1	We're preparing to start negotiations, right now, with Japan.
Trump	1	With us, they are like, you know, safe, totally safe.
Trump	1	Not bad.
Trump	1	He said he's not leaving.
Trump	1	We have to take them through court.
Trump	1	What they don't tell you is the bad guys aren't giving up their guns.
Trump	1	They don't -- they don't give it to you on the other side, folks.
Trump	1	That's number one, sir.
Trump	1	And he was attacking me and our great administration.
Trump	1	The military needs it so badly and it's going to be very quickly completed and many other enhancements in the great state of Florida to help our wonderful warriors, Who are doing such an incredible job as an example at Eglin Air Force Base, Eglin.
Trump	1	I want to thank by the way the House Intelligence Committee.
Trump	1	We go positive, we make a lot of money.
Trump	1	Sir, we'd like you to sign this order.
Trump	1	I said, I heard it was unattainable.
Trump	1	I don't know.
Trump	1	We could end it immediately if the Democrats gave, so what we're doing is something else, we're keeping them out altogether.
Trump	1	Stop human smugglers.
Trump	1	Although 50 years ago, they did well, but for many, many years, nobody's seen anything like it.
Trump	1	I mean, I hate to say, a lot of respect for unions, a lot of respect for civil servants, but that's a tough thing to get by the unions and the civil servants, right?
Trump	1	Yes.
Trump	1	And it's all going to work out, it's all going to work out.
Trump	1	They challenge things, they challenge everything, every word you say.
Trump	1	I don't know -- I don't know if we're going to be dropping him anywhere near his -- he may have to travel for two days after he gets dropped off, but -- [Laughter] -- but you're invited to come with us.
Trump	1	That's a lot of people.
Trump	1	He is going to be a great, great governor.
Trump	1	By the way, the Olympics, the World Cup -- I mean, the big stuff, you know what that is.
Trump	1	They want to raise your taxes.
Trump	1	Because they know I hired the Teamsters, thousands of Teamsters.
Trump	1	I wasn't happy with it.
Trump	1	"Sir."
Trump	1	You know, we have a very, very tall wonderful senator here.
Trump	1	And he's ranting and raving.
Trump	1	Remember with the hand, that it starts to shake.
Trump	1	And when they come in he wants to give them free education, free medical, free health care.
Trump	1	Economy and strength is security.
Trump	1	We cured disease, pioneered science, and produced timeless works of art that inspire the human soul.
Trump	1	We didn't.
Trump	1	We're going out to buy land.
Trump	1	But we'll see how it all works out.
Trump	1	They don't like to talk about mental health.
Trump	1	But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place.
Trump	1	It's oftentimes I'm getting ready to do my -- you know, the fake news with CNN and MSN -- MSNBC is so corrupt.
Trump	1	It is the spirit that lives in each and every one of you.
Trump	1	We have had tremendous results.
Trump	1	It's a negative.
Trump	1	But if we had something that really looked promising and somebody was terminally ill, they could not use that drug, and you'd see them -- if they had money.
Trump	1	Boy, oh, boy.
Trump	1	I don't think so.
Trump	1	And, by the way, had we spent a billion, it would end up costing $3 billion or $4 billion for -- you know, people would look at it, probably one-third the size of this room.
Trump	1	And what do we have?
Trump	1	I did.
Trump	1	That’s great.
Trump	1	Everything.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] How do you do that?
Trump	1	Republicans believe we should protect public benefits for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens.
Trump	1	Goodbye.
Trump	1	But we got him back the right way.
Trump	1	Look at him in the corner, so shy.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay?
Trump	1	Here's one of the greatest -- here is one of the best statistics ever.
Trump	1	All of the thousands of guys and women standing on these building get fired; they go home.
Trump	1	Where do these people come from?
Trump	1	Remember that?
Trump	1	We're the bank that everybody's stealing from.
Trump	1	He'd come in at 218 and he'd be fighting people and I could say Riddick Bowe, I could say plenty of them and they were good.
Trump	1	They're barriers.
Trump	1	[Audience chants Four more years] Go ahead.
Trump	1	I mean, we're not going to -- it's been under construction forever.
Trump	1	I've watched the things you've done and it's incredible.
Trump	1	So how's somebody going to do better?
Trump	1	She is very strong, tough but a great woman.
Trump	1	If we build here -- you know, right now we're -- you become dependent on buying things from outside.
Trump	1	So nice.
Trump	1	The Republican Party is the party of freedom.
Trump	1	I'd say, The Tax Cut Cut Cut bill of... [Laughter] ...and they didn't like that.
Trump	1	We go into wars to defend their borders, we don't defend our own borders.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	We reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace that doctrine -- you know what I'm saying?
Trump	1	And we might be able to get Democrat support.
Trump	1	[Applause] Every day you turn ideas into action, you turn vision into creation -- I know you well -- and you turn dreams into reality.
Trump	1	They've been talking about bias.
Trump	1	Going up very little by comparison.
Trump	1	But you have to see, that is all red, Republican red, beautiful, Republican red.
Trump	1	I thought Adam was the son.
Trump	1	Hasn't been won in a long time.
Trump	1	Thank you, Sid.
Trump	1	How many other Presidents -- you think Hillary Clinton would have done that?
Trump	1	I -- I had written down just a couple of little things.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	I signed the deal.
Trump	1	[Audience member calls "We Love You"] Thank you very much.
Trump	1	We don't want them.
Trump	1	Everything's like jobs, jobs is very important to me.
Trump	1	We will end chain migration.
Trump	1	And many lives will be saved because we have incredible -- incredible things, but some of them won't be passed and approved for another 3 or 4 years, and we brought that number -- it was taking 15 years to have something approved; we're bringing it down to 2 or 3 or 4.
Trump	1	We don't want that.
Trump	1	What a job.
Trump	1	What people do you think these countries are putting in?
Trump	1	They've got problems.
Trump	1	I mean, even worse.
Trump	1	He's a very important guy.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	He has to win big.
Trump	1	You know, you read the fake news.
Trump	1	And supposing he didn't get -- supposing we didn't stick?
Trump	1	And we're going to give you a new one.
Trump	1	They carve you up with a knife, but they're people.
Trump	1	The Mayor of Tijuana, he said these are tough people.
Trump	1	We're going to have the wall.
Trump	1	USMCA.
Trump	1	When the Redcoats tried to steal American boats, the patriots sank those boats and sank them very quickly.
Trump	1	We're also processing veteran disability claims more quickly than ever before, by far.
Trump	1	And it was going to go from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
Trump	1	And Katie is a very special person.
Trump	1	That is why I'm proud to report that we are now undertaking the greatest rebuilding of our United States military in its history.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	Since election day, we have created 4.5 million new jobs... and we have lifted 4.3 million people off of food stamps.
Trump	1	I said how you doing?
Trump	1	It didn't allow us to use our wealth, would have stolen our jobs, but just take a look at what's happening to other places where they're trying to do it.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	"We will do this.
Trump	1	And the other ones.
Trump	1	We now have a good thing.
Trump	1	They're not well.
Trump	1	To every single member of the VFW, because of your service, your courage, and your example, we are restoring the dreams and the glory, and the greatness of America.
Trump	1	We have a great country.
Trump	1	We've reduced the United Nations spending by $1.3 billion saving U.S. taxpayers $350 million.
Trump	1	Come here.
Trump	1	No, they kept it right on your face.
Trump	1	Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.
Trump	1	These are sick people.
Trump	1	Montana Attorney General Tim Fox.
Trump	1	At the center of America's resurgence are the massive tax cuts that Republicans passed and that I signed into law six months ago this week.
Trump	1	If somebody is terminally ill let's let them have access to our drugs.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Mark's great wife.
Trump	1	No, but have you been seeing this whole scam?
Trump	1	There is more spirit for the Republican Party right now than I've ever seen.
Trump	1	Because you know what?
Trump	1	They have moved so far left that Pocahontas is considered a conservative.
Trump	1	True.
Trump	1	I did great with women.
Trump	1	And I will tell you, you don't love the left too much.
Trump	1	I think you're going to see some very good results.
Trump	1	Better believe it.
Trump	1	And we have so many of them here today.
Trump	1	That was a strong guy, by the way, in case... [Laughter] Because if that was a woman, I'm in big trouble.
Trump	1	It declined 8% last year.
Trump	1	Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people.
Trump	1	And I have two or three piles of stacks of paper.
Trump	1	So I won the presidency, which is really "we" won the presidency, and we have the greatest economy that this nation has ever seen, jobs and everything else.
Trump	1	You all know about economic growth going up to now -- it was 4.1; now it's 4.2.
Trump	1	When we won, they suffered.
Trump	1	So we've redone it, and that's going to level the playing field on steel and cars and trucks coming into this country.
Trump	1	He worked for Ronald Reagan.
Trump	1	And they go borrow money at the end up losing it to a bank a couple of years later.
Trump	1	We're proud of it again.
Trump	1	So once more, to every citizen throughout our land: Have a glorious Independence Day.
Trump	1	But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.
Trump	1	Stock market's up 55 percent.
Trump	1	Everyday, our heroic ICE officers are tracking down gang members, predators, thieves and killers.
Trump	1	I got you a big one.
Trump	1	Everybody tells me.
Trump	1	Yet Democrats want to abolish ICE.
Trump	1	For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
Trump	1	That could happen.
Trump	1	You know about economic growth?
Trump	1	And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it's very, very hard -- prohibitively hard -- for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location.
Trump	1	It's picked up based on everything you can think of that makes sense.
Trump	1	But now I understand you're in great shape in November, Troy; that was really a great race.
Trump	1	That's what they say.
Trump	1	All I have to do is say, "Yes, we want to take care of everybody.
Trump	1	In fact, I wanted to say, "I got to do something about this Trump."
Trump	1	And we're not going to let it happen.
Trump	1	You know that.
Trump	1	Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else.
Trump	1	I'll tell you, with the statistics I just rattled off, who could do better than that?
Trump	1	Hi, Catherine.
Trump	1	They don't even need nuclear weapons for that.
Trump	1	This is the only solution to the border crisis.
Trump	1	I want to introduce another congressmen who has been a friend of mine, also, for a long time.
Trump	1	Now if we want to drive them crazy, I'll, say in 10 years they'll go crazy.
Trump	1	I have many much more beautiful homes than they do.
Trump	1	But I want to tell you something, the Democrats are being so vile and so vicious moving so far left, it's out of control.
Trump	1	And if you don't love it, you're not going to be good at it.
Trump	1	Now, you've got to get over to a place that I like a lot, Lordstown.
Trump	1	What the hell do I know about specialty milk?
Trump	1	And you know what, we did something that was wonderful and the world is soon going to be and right now it is already, we have good chemistry, but the world is going to be a much safer place.
Trump	1	What Tester did to Admiral Jackson should never, ever be allowed.
Trump	1	Did he get treated badly and unfairly or what?
Trump	1	Not acceptable, it's not going to happen.
Trump	1	He said I will sow the cattle is now going to China, but and plenty of other things, and he said last week at a speech.
Trump	1	Thank you, Tom.
Trump	1	Look at the crowds we're getting.
Trump	1	She is tough.
Trump	1	To help critically ill patients get life-saving treatment, we passed something that they've been trying to pass for 46 years.
Trump	1	You will be now.
Trump	1	You don't have any more nuclear testing, in fact, they're closing up a lot of the sites.
Trump	1	When you enter the voting booth on Tuesday, you will be making a simple choice -- a vote for Republicans is a vote to continue our extraordinary prosperity, our extraordinary journey together.
Trump	1	And guess what.
Trump	1	That's such an important thing.
Trump	1	And they said, let's do it.
Trump	1	We want to compete with the oil.
Trump	1	By the way, while I'm at it, Kristi was one of the people most instrumental in getting us the massive tax reduction that you got, and it was really... ...really good.
Trump	1	That doesn't mean that they're not going to go around.
Trump	1	We will defend your Second Amendment and protect your right to free speech and religious liberty.
Trump	1	[Audience chants Build that wall] And the wall is being built.
Trump	1	As you know, Rick is running to replace liberal Democrat, Schumer-controlled, Nancy Pelosi-controlled ... [Booing] ... And the new star of the Democrat Party, Maxine Waters.
Trump	1	And that all happened over the last two years.
Trump	1	I used to say that.
Trump	1	America's future depends on young leaders like you who are proud of who you are, proud of where they come from, proud of the American values we all hold dear.
Trump	1	I had it in the debate.
Trump	1	This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much, everybody.
Trump	1	A special person who works so hard.
Trump	1	For years you watched as powerful forces in Washington shipped away your jobs.
Trump	1	It'll be approved pretty quickly, and that opens up Canada and Mexico to the farmers and to manufacturers.
Trump	1	For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
Trump	1	At the very end of our meeting, I said to Chairman Kim -- good relationship, good feeling -- I said, "I would really appreciate if you could do that."
Trump	1	It's not fair.
Trump	1	What's going on?
Trump	1	They make a deal just for the sake of doing it.
Trump	1	I'm not talking about people coming in.
Trump	1	That's what I do, is I build.
Trump	1	Removed job killing regulations and created more than 1.6 million new Florida jobs.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And the problem is, with Mark, if I make a little mistake, he'll let us know on Sunday night.
Trump	1	Do we agree?
Trump	1	They have barriers.
Trump	1	Sonny -- maybe Sonny and I will go take a jog.
Trump	1	But we got $6 billion to help us with opioid.
Trump	1	I mean, you look at it.
Trump	1	In other words, they're immediately fired.
Trump	1	Remember?
Trump	1	 I love these hangars.
Trump	1	You now have a president who is standing up proudly for America.
Trump	1	A highway that would take 20 years to get approved.
Trump	1	Tear down our history and destroy our very proud American heritage.
Trump	1	In fact, his brother, you know, the coach of the winning women's team in the Olympics.
Trump	1	That's suppression.
Trump	1	And much more into the future.
Trump	1	You know what I'm going to say.
Trump	1	Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
Trump	1	And he said, "Oh, yes, yes, yes."
Trump	1	Nice guy.
Trump	1	You've got to go vote.
Trump	1	And they keep coming back.
Trump	1	I can see it.
Trump	1	And we're getting him the hell out of our country and giving them to the stupid politicians that have been running the United States for many years.
Trump	1	And the whole damn building is made practically of Jerusalem stone.
Trump	1	Rick, thank you very much.
Trump	1	Dr. Bill.
Trump	1	And we are keeping open the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.
Trump	1	Get your ass out of here.
Trump	1	Richard's a winner.
Trump	1	This state was settled by pioneers and visionaries who explored the marshes and raised up cities right on the sea.
Trump	1	But the best of all: The blue-collar worker has the biggest percentage increase of anybody.
Trump	1	It's happening.
Trump	1	She's going to take over Financial Services in Congress.
Trump	1	But while Republicans were fighting to reduce taxes for hardworking Americans, the Democrats were fighting to increase taxes.
Trump	1	We can't.
Trump	1	I said, "Wait a minute, I just said hello to the guy 15 minutes ago, he's hugging and kissing me.
Trump	1	They don't have to wait in line.
Trump	1	I don't want to put it on because I'm afraid that I'll mess up my hair.
Trump	1	Last year prescription drug prices went down for the first time in 51 years.
Trump	1	We have a great, great -- oh please vote tomorrow.
Trump	1	These are historic gains.
Trump	1	And we're getting a lot of it back.
Trump	1	You keep picking them.
Trump	1	And the firewall wasn't much of a firewall in North Carolina.
Trump	1	We will never give up.
Trump	1	Did we leak?
Trump	1	But they never show it.
Trump	1	You've got two good men.
Trump	1	Excuse me, we went to South Carolina, but I didn't come here that often, you know why?
Trump	1	Celia.
Trump	1	If they have a wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor, we pay for the doctor and our veterans taken care of.
Trump	1	We have the greatest economy we've ever had.
Trump	1	They did not think it was possible.
Trump	1	Voter ID.
Trump	1	We will protect Medicare and Social Security.

Trump	1	Do you want protection or not?"
Trump	1	Thank you, everybody.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Great.
Trump	1	They love our country and they are going in to towns and cities and places and they are throwing MS-13 gang members the hell out of our country by the thousands, by the thousands.
Trump	1	[Applause] Right?
Trump	1	They're fake news media.
Trump	1	Come on.
Trump	1	I love -- I love you anyway.
Trump	1	They call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel, it was mixed up, it was bad stuff.
Trump	1	Forty years they've been trying to do it.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Don't forget, we're the piggy bank that everybody's robbing.
Trump	1	The Dems will end ethanol.
Trump	1	Sir, $1 billion.
Trump	1	So it's great and it's going to be fantastic in the wake of the terrible storm.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much.
Trump	1	Mike DeWine and Jon Husted, they got together, the two top candidates, they called it a merger.
Trump	1	The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE -- the brave, brave people of ICE.
Trump	1	That was a disaster.
Trump	1	Last week, I traveled to McAllen, Texas to tour the border and meet with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol.
Trump	1	A fantastic football player, by the way, for those of you that remember.
Trump	1	Better vote for Karin.
Trump	1	They better damn well, be careful, because people are wise to it now.
Trump	1	You've never had crowds like this for midterm elections.

Trump	1	And thank you very much and congratulations and to your family.
Trump	1	And we have more to cut.
Trump	1	And you're the smartest people, you're the smartest people.
Trump	1	Excuse me, how many of you know friends?
Trump	1	Because We are finally putting America first.
Trump	1	And he ended up winning.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican.
Trump	1	We want to be able to get in.
Trump	1	America is respected again.
Trump	1	And we're there; we're going to be able to do that.
Trump	1	[Applause] And always remember: We have picked up in wealth trillions and trillions of dollars for our country since our election -- not my election, our election.
Trump	1	I didn't know.
Trump	1	No longer.
Trump	1	Right.
Trump	1	Fake news.
Trump	1	A jurist with a sterling record of public service - you know, for ten years -- he's a young guy, but for ten years they've been talking about him longer than that.
Trump	1	There are thousands and thousands of people.
Trump	1	And in the meantime, your taxes go up, although they actually because of me have gone down, so I -- The International Trade Commission recently announced that under the USMCA American dairy exports to Canada are expected to surge by more than 50%, OK?
Trump	1	Thank you, Louie.
Trump	1	And they all played.
Trump	1	It's too hokey."
Trump	1	Not going to happen anymore, unless we straighten it out.
Trump	1	And they said, what a vicious statement made.
Trump	1	That's a great number.
Trump	1	And when I said he wouldn't last long, he'd be down faster than Greg would take him down.
Trump	1	[Laughter] More beautiful.
Trump	1	Just, "Let's have dinner.
Trump	1	So, let's let them keep calling themselves the elite.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	I don't even read this thing.
Trump	1	What would you say?
Trump	1	I just said -- because, you know, I just -- you know the way I feel.
Trump	1	We get our great, great people.
Trump	1	If we didn't have some of those walls -- the military has been incredible.
Trump	1	Thompson, Scott Perry, and Dan Meuser.
Trump	1	I got a gotten anybody in this audience I could have found something on you.
Trump	1	Guess what?
Trump	1	I call it the Academy Awards.
Trump	1	Texas is the state where generations of farmers, ranchers, oil workers, and pioneers help build up the most extraordinary nation in all of human history.
Trump	1	That number is soon going to exceed 600,000 and our opponent said there's no such thing as manufacturing jobs anymore, right?
Trump	1	But it's not fair the way they treat us.
Trump	1	It's like when I called Pocahontas, Pocahontas.
Trump	1	And also, all of our friends and our supporters, you've been incredible.
Trump	1	You know, when we took over it was really low, and it was heading lower, a lot lower.
Trump	1	And people that are hiring many of these prisoners are saying unbelievable how good they are.
Trump	1	You have to do it.
Trump	1	We're the engine -- you know, it wasn't going up.
Trump	1	And I'll tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal.
Trump	1	And, honestly, not for that reason, you want to get out.
Trump	1	Frankly, they're as tough or tougher than China, just smaller numbers.
Trump	1	And now it's a big beauty.
Trump	1	But ICE, in Long Island, where I sort of grew up -- I was right next to these areas.
Trump	1	That's a very hard soundbite to beat, right, if you're the opponent of Trump?
Trump	1	We've taken care of our vets.
Trump	1	That's what he's doing.
Trump	1	[Laughter] "I'm going to recuse."
Trump	1	It's up to you to choose our future.
Trump	1	But you know what I've said, I don't want to talk about reform because nobody knows what it means.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Figure that one out.
Trump	1	He lost one match in three years of college.
Trump	1	We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July.
Trump	1	And yes, they're tough, they're strong, they're smart, they have great heart, but they go into these communities loaded up with the kind of criminals you don't want to be dealing with.
Trump	1	Then they come back.
Trump	1	Who the hell knows what's nesting?
Trump	1	For this reason, my administration resurrected Project Safe Neighborhoods, bringing together prosecutors, police, sheriffs, and citizens groups to put the most dangerous offenders behind bars.
Trump	1	They'll say, "What have you been doing?"
Trump	1	We've added something great to our portfolio by increasing exports of clean, beautiful coal by over 60 percent.
Trump	1	I'm changing titles.
Trump	1	[Laughter] He'll win by 30, 35.
Trump	1	And we believe in religious liberty.
Trump	1	And illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers, including African-American and Hispanic-American.
Trump	1	That was a great day.
Trump	1	Just so you know, we're building the Wall anyway.
Trump	1	The United States is now the No.
Trump	1	I wish Mexico would stop them.
Trump	1	These are popular people.
Trump	1	You know what?
Trump	1	We need his energy.
Trump	1	-- also wants to take away your health care.
Trump	1	A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail.
Trump	1	You know what you call them, right?
Trump	1	The USMCA like YMCA.
Trump	1	And our great House Ways and Means chairman, Kevin Brady, who joins us tonight, has done an incredible job.
Trump	1	This initiative brings law enforcement, community groups, and local leaders together to get the most violent criminals in the most dangerous areas off the streets and behind bars.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I wouldn't give him too much.
Trump	1	This country has never seen it.
Trump	1	Remember?
Trump	1	We actually delivered more than we promised and let me just tell you this, we're really doing well with North Korea.
Trump	1	Thank you, Kim.
Trump	1	He has been a wonderful leader in this great State that we love.
Trump	1	For many, many years, they've been paying for it.
Trump	1	And now I want to be two for two, two for two."
Trump	1	Somehow I wasn't too worried about the ICE officers.
Trump	1	So, you know.
Trump	1	A vote -- that's all right.
Trump	1	We love Elvis.
Trump	1	Congressman Tom Massie.
Trump	1	And I actually hear that's an old number.
Trump	1	I think we're going to go a lot on.
Trump	1	None of your business.
Trump	1	It's driving them crazy.
Trump	1	And I said, "How much would it cost?"
Trump	1	We're paying massive subsidy.
Trump	1	And remember this.
Trump	1	Brian Babin.
Trump	1	They came out "more popular than" a man I like, Ronald Reagan.
Trump	1	I've known this guy so long -- from kindergarten.
Trump	1	It's all the time we need.
Trump	1	Pretty soon, congressman, Keep America Great.
Trump	1	And Gillum supports deadly sanctuary cities.
Trump	1	I gave him credit, also, for sticking it out.
Trump	1	Me.

Trump	1	I got thousands of troops.
Trump	1	I said, what the hell did you do?
Trump	1	You know what?
Trump	1	Any veterans in the room?
Trump	1	We want to build our roads, and highways, and bridges, and dams.
Trump	1	Democrats want to raise your taxes, impose socialism, dismantle law enforcement... ... eliminate ICE... ... and get rid of American borders.
Trump	1	All over the country, they're looking at South Carolina.
Trump	1	We have the greatest people on earth and they can't do anything because the laws are corrupt.
Trump	1	We will never, ever back down.
Trump	1	I don’t think I have to answer that question, but the press keeps, "What do you think of McCain?
Trump	1	I'm really proud to report that earlier today we secured the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey.
Trump	1	I said, we're not touching your Social Security.
Trump	1	Syria, we want to bring our troops back home.
Trump	1	And by the way, your 401(k)s?

Trump	1	Patrick, come up here.

Trump	1	If I ever come into an arena, and it's got empty seats, I think that's the end.
Trump	1	No, the lines are bigger tonight.
Trump	1	Democrats want to completely destroy Medicare with so-called Medicare for all.

Trump	1	Let's see.
Trump	1	She's like a conservative person, Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren, she's considered like a conservative person.
Trump	1	They're probably saying in Russia, you know, if we did like this guy, we've made a big mistake.
Trump	1	And on immigration, Tester's record can be summarized in two simple words: Open borders.
Trump	1	Kalena, I want to thank you and all of those incredible people that you represent.
Trump	1	We're up to 107.
Trump	1	We're getting them done in less than a year.
Trump	1	What about the thousands of birds they're killing?
Trump	1	And you know, Oprah was a friend of mine until I ran for office.
Trump	1	When he came to me, he said, It's $7 million to stop.
Trump	1	Their whole campaign is resist, resist.
Trump	1	So if you look at Jon Tester, he signed up for the Democrats' radical immigration agenda, which is "let them come in, and we believe they say, in sanctuary cities where they house the criminals and others" -- we believe in strong borders and no crime, it's very simple.
Trump	1	It was just announced that manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high.
Trump	1	And he's driving down the West Side Highway, this beautiful park along the West Side Highway in Manhattan that I know very, very well.
Trump	1	It's working its way through, I must tell you, some of it's not going to happen unless you vote for Republicans in the upcoming election, and I will tell you it's not very far away and you're going to have great immigration laws.

Trump	1	In the meantime, the USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown.
Trump	1	Probably never happens, right?
Trump	1	We've actually given you more promises and a couple of my opponents said this, they weren't happy about it, but we've given you more promises than we said we would do.
Trump	1	It's November 3rd this time.
Trump	1	Vote for me.
Trump	1	As an example, thousands of people in a room next door, thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in, this big stadium is packed, always.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] Not all of them.
Trump	1	The stock market is at record highs.
Trump	1	We're just about at a record clip -- ever.
Trump	1	Absolutely.

Trump	1	That's what we're doing.
Trump	1	I wouldn't have the courage to call Henry.
Trump	1	No, no, seriously, did anyone know he had a D rating?
Trump	1	I say, "No, no..." -- I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it -- [Audience Boos] [Audience Boos] The Green New Deal, right?

Trump	1	I called the heads of agencies.
Trump	1	Their southern border.
Trump	1	You have very, very special, very smart, very brave, brave people.
Trump	1	[Audience Laughs] I can't believe -- you know, I know Ohio pretty well, right?
Trump	1	But really unfair stuff, but you know what, we've never done better than we're doing now.
Trump	1	No, they put out -- the fake news -- they put out messages -- these people right back here.
Trump	1	[Applause] Thank you.
Trump	1	They're full citizens.
Trump	1	We've created more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs.

Trump	1	No, I don't think I -- well, wait.
Trump	1	People that don't exactly dig us and they don't exactly like me, they're fighting for us.
Trump	1	All of this stuff taken down.
Trump	1	They're voting for... [Audience Boos] They're for the new de facto leader of the Democratic Party, Maxine Waters.
Trump	1	I said, "David, what can we do?"
Trump	1	It was ready.
Trump	1	It's for no reason whatsoever, so we promise to always remember Sarah and to fight in our memory to protect America's children, and I want to thank you very much for being -- you've been my friend for a long time, a lot of friends, a lot of friends.
Trump	1	How many times did you hear, for months and months, "There is no way to 270"?

Trump	1	With your help on November 3, 2020.
Trump	1	We want to give him technology."
Trump	1	Oprah, when she ended her show, had her five most important people, I assume, her last week.
Trump	1	How you doing in Paris?"
Trump	1	I have to always say that, because then they'll say they did actually challenge it, and they'll put like -- then they'll say he gets a Pinocchio.
Trump	1	You know, if somebody else did what I did, two great Supreme Court justices already, Justice Neil Gorsuch, don't forget, one of the greats.
Trump	1	One billion under budget.
Trump	1	America's economy is the hottest anywhere in the world, and it's not even close.
Trump	1	She doesn't like Israel, I forgot, I'm so sorry, oh.
Trump	1	We need a whole new thinking.
Trump	1	Don't you.
Trump	1	Did you see that?
Trump	1	They used to give them incentives to leave.
Trump	1	They're doing a phenomenal job.
Trump	1	And if you turn in Monday at 9 o'clock, I think you're going to be extremely with the selection, right?
Trump	1	Thank you very much everybody.
Trump	1	Nobody was able to tell me.
Trump	1	They said, "He's working on healthcare."
Trump	1	Let me tell you, you got to get out and vote.
Trump	1	Really?
Trump	1	What's happened is somewhat of a miracle because we weren't expected to win.
Trump	1	Justice Jeanine.
Trump	1	Since the last election -- and these are numbers that the fakers back there, the fake news, would never have allowed me to say.
Trump	1	Hey, Mark, you're now blamed on television, right?
Trump	1	I get there the first day.
Trump	1	At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force.
Trump	1	Pick a name, pick a name, come on into the country.
Trump	1	They're not taking care of our vets, we fire them.
Trump	1	I said, "You could take a little longer than that."
Trump	1	You people are going to get so tired of winning."
Trump	1	Secretary Azar, great job.
Trump	1	And instead of spending $1.1 billion, I opened it up for $400,000.
Trump	1	We took it away.
Trump	1	Democrat immigration policies allow poisonous drugs, vicious gang members, and MS-13 killers to pour into our country, and we've done a great job.
Trump	1	We're going to go $200 billion at 25 percent, Chinese-made goods, and we will come back more if they retaliate.
Trump	1	True.
Trump	1	But I said, in the end it's okay, because at least Canada knows how I feel.
Trump	1	I think they felt good about that; do you think they like that poll?
Trump	1	A year and a half -- that's all it is.
Trump	1	Been a long time.
Trump	1	Absolutely, we will fight -- in the meantime, nothing.
Trump	1	Now, almost a year later, this tremendously qualified professional with nearly three decades of intelligence experience is still awaiting confirmation.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	Since that meeting, we have already seen a number of encouraging measures that few could have imagined only a short time ago.
Trump	1	Horrible thing happened.
Trump	1	That's something.
Trump	1	Drain the swamp.
Trump	1	We've helped rebuild China.
Trump	1	So we have the Army Corps of Engineers are doing a fantastic job and they're getting it done.
Trump	1	And last month alone, we added another 32,000 manufacturing jobs.
Trump	1	And mine was pretty big.
Trump	1	Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it.
Trump	1	The contrast in this election could not be more clear.
Trump	1	With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals.
Trump	1	That's not bad.
Trump	1	I think we won by nine points.
Trump	1	Many people never even heard of it.
Trump	1	I thought of it during the debate, because Hillary Clinton was so staunch on abortion and rights of abortion.
Trump	1	Also a woman who -- she was really tough and smart and did a great job, and she's become a friend of mine, Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor.
Trump	1	How nice.
Trump	1	In fact, ISIS -- let me tell you about ISIS.
Trump	1	Their president is a great gentleman, we had a great talk over the last couple of days and met with their people, and we have things that we never thought possible.
Trump	1	When we pledged to work over corruption in Washington, these are the people we're talking about.
Trump	1	He's Da Nang Dick.
Trump	1	That's where it's at.
Trump	1	They've been making $300 billion to $500 billion a year, taking it out of our country.
Trump	1	"I do want to come, but I really want you to win today.
Trump	1	It's probably about 20 years ahead of schedule.
Trump	1	Maxine Waters, "We will impeach him."
Trump	1	Republicans are the party of safety and Republicans are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs.
Trump	1	And frankly, this I don't care about it compared to taking care of our veterans, but it's also less expensive if you can believe that.
Trump	1	He said, sir, I want to tell you that people are coming out of the mountains, out of the rivers, out of -- they're coming out of the valleys.
Trump	1	A lot of people say you meant to say well actually their name is the Democrat party.
Trump	1	The person is not alive.
Trump	1	The forgotten men and women of our country, our forgotten, where they're still trying to figure out who the hell were all these people that came and voted two years ago?
Trump	1	This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.
Trump	1	If Democrats gained power on Tuesday, one of their very first projects will be a socialist takeover of American healthcare.
Trump	1	Look at what Charlie has done, you'd be amazed.
Trump	1	No, you know who it is?
Trump	1	Thank you, Cory, great job, doing a great job.
Trump	1	She fought for decades to end slavery, to secure women's right to vote, and to respect the dignity of every single person.
Trump	1	And I said, "Listen.
Trump	1	And sadly, China, who I have a very good relationship with.
Trump	1	I said, "Oh, I've got to endorse Katie."
Trump	1	We need more Republicans.
Trump	1	I also want you to go and vote for an incredible Montana leader, somebody that's gone to Congress, and in a short period of time, one of the most respected people in Congress, Greg Gianforte.
Trump	1	Boy.
Trump	1	 My Administration is committed to giving every American the opportunity to find a great job and have a rewarding career -- there’s nothing like it.
Trump	1	I said, "Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci-..." If they charge us, we charge them.
Trump	1	A lot of people think we're going to have a big win.
Trump	1	They're asking me about preexisting -- Alice, please take me home."
Trump	1	And yet we have 25,000 people showing up to speeches.
Trump	1	Hopefully there's nobody in this room that's going to have to worry about that.
Trump	1	We believe in the dignity of work, and we believe in the sanctity of life, and we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way.
Trump	1	What's happening with their policies are horrible.
Trump	1	And those cameras, they looked like pretzels the way they turned.
Trump	1	And we also got a thing called ANWR, possibly the biggest drilling site anywhere in the world in Alaska, one of the biggest drilling sites, but maybe the biggest anywhere in the world.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] You know, in the studio, you hear, they go, listen, he's about ready to go.
Trump	1	We are keeping our promise to buy American and hire American.
Trump	1	More Americans are working today than at any point in the history of our country.
Trump	1	And that number, very shortly, will be up, David, to 640,000.
Trump	1	Thank you, Claudia.
Trump	1	OK?
Trump	1	This isn't about nice anymore.
Trump	1	Got to go there.
Trump	1	Now we're going to have a second time, we're going to have another one, and then we'll drive them crazy, you're ready?
Trump	1	It's doing well.
Trump	1	You don't even get it.
Trump	1	The other one, I'm too nice, I'm too nice.
Trump	1	Jim, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Trump	1	But unless we get more Republicans, they have to change the laws, and if they don't change the laws, we're going to have the problem.
Trump	1	I need their vote, and we're never going to get their vote.
Trump	1	Anyway, today she called, they're going to be opening, it's going to be a great company going there, it is really wonderful.
Trump	1	Nobody thought that would happen, but it's a great thing that it's happening, because we have a country that we have to run.
Trump	1	Oh, we won.
Trump	1	Wow, New Hampshire was so great.
Trump	1	We always win.
Trump	1	Okay?
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	Phil was a major financial supporter of President Obama and of Hillary -- crooked Hillary Clinton.
Trump	1	The problem is, they couldn't get it passed.
Trump	1	[Applause] And we are especially excited to have with us the man who is your state's current attorney general and newly-elected United States senator -- that's why I've been here so much lately -- Josh Hawley.
Trump	1	Okay?
Trump	1	Do I have to use that term?
Trump	1	He wants to take off the gas tax.
Trump	1	There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it.
Trump	1	I love those states.
Trump	1	So we have a lot of great things going.
Trump	1	I'm embarrassed to say it.
Trump	1	In fact, they fight so much that I sometimes say I don't want to take their call today.
Trump	1	And I said, "I appreciate it."
Trump	1	And I didn't know too much about it.
Trump	1	They've been waiting in line for two days and stuff.
Trump	1	I didn't see the apology, but that's OK because let me tell you, right from the beginning, Troy Balderson, he is the guy, he is the guy that's going to do things.
Trump	1	He's a courageous guy.
Trump	1	It was over.
Trump	1	But he campaigned, for years, for "repeal and replace."
Trump	1	He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began.
Trump	1	The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable.
Trump	1	By the way, we're impeaching him.
Trump	1	I won't use the rhetoric now.
Trump	1	And our farmers understand it, and our workers understand it.
Trump	1	We will drain the swamp.
Trump	1	You don't like his energy.
Trump	1	But you know what?
Trump	1	Whether we like it, don't like it, doesn't matter.
Trump	1	They want to be where the action is.
Trump	1	We don't want them coming up.
Trump	1	Remember, right?
Trump	1	We did some incredible rallies.
Trump	1	We have a majority that if somebody has a cold, if somebody's not feeling well, we lose our majority.
Trump	1	Did you ever think you're going to hear that again but before -- and this is a number that when I'd say it even on the campaign trail, I used to say uh, the fake news is gonna kill me in this, you know, because if they catch you make a little mistake, I'd say: we've lost 60,000 American factories.
Trump	1	But you know what's happening?
Trump	1	And now you have places where they want to give college tuition to illegal immigrants and your own kids can't get it.
Trump	1	You're a great scholar.
Trump	1	You know, 100 -- I really believe it.
Trump	1	You can't raise your drug prices.
Trump	1	So many you don't have time to write them.
Trump	1	Not one person has left, and I've been up here a long time.
Trump	1	They never talk.
Trump	1	Vice President Mike Pence got the remains.
Trump	1	[Applause] And we will breathe new hope into our communities.
Trump	1	I'll tell you, honestly, the single greatest ally that the Democrats have is the fake news media, because without that, these crazy ideas -- I can't believe they'd go anywhere.
Trump	1	It's been an amazing period of time.
Trump	1	These are the people we need on our Supreme Court.
Trump	1	I said -- you know, it's Saturday morning, and I said, "Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time?"
Trump	1	Thank you very much Pensacola, Florida.
Trump	1	I don't think so.
Trump	1	And a red wave equals jobs and security.
Trump	1	We can't have that.
Trump	1	He should.
Trump	1	I said, What is this?
Trump	1	But -- so he challenges me to a fight, and the fake news said, oh, isn't that cute?
Trump	1	So we've taken historic action to fight the opioid epidemic, what a problem.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	Remember the old days, we actually made our own product.
Trump	1	And the landmark V.A.
Trump	1	They would shut down your free speech, use the power of the law to punish their opponents, which they're trying to do now anyway, they'll always be trying to shield themselves.
Trump	1	What the radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh and his beautiful family... is a national disgrace.
Trump	1	Your vote in this election will decide which party controls Congress.
Trump	1	Rick and Ron.
Trump	1	We have to -- we have to get this done.
Trump	1	Stand up, Steve.
Trump	1	And we're now on the right track.
Trump	1	We've added 3.7 million new jobs since the election, that beautiful, beautiful election in November of '16.
Trump	1	Finally, tomorrow the people of Ohio are going to elect an outstanding new Governor and Lieutenant Governor.
Trump	1	And it's not by luck.
Trump	1	The Special Counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction.
Trump	1	But some are not honest.
Trump	1	That's the way it works, I guess, too bad.
Trump	1	We have 180 million people right now, really happy on private plans.
Trump	1	Tonight we're proudly joined by terrific Republican leaders from the great state of Missouri, including Lieutenant Governor Mike Kehoe.
Trump	1	This guy just screamed out 14 more years now.
Trump	1	Much tougher than the men, by the way, but we won't -- tough women.
Trump	1	I think irredeemables is worst than deplorables, but I'll never forget.
Trump	1	The best in the world.
Trump	1	Mexico, I don't want to cause a problem.
Trump	1	And they understand it.
Trump	1	There was no excuses.
Trump	1	Remember, the insurance policy, just in case Hillary Clinton lost.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Let's stay pleasant.
Trump	1	Great governor.
Trump	1	You are now leaders in the most powerful and righteous force on the face of the planet.
Trump	1	They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.
Trump	1	Look at this field.
Trump	1	Harvard, Yale, smart.
Trump	1	Wages are rising.
Trump	1	And that's a real low number.
Trump	1	This is a cheap poll, but it's better than any poll you could get.
Trump	1	And I really thank them, too, honestly.
Trump	1	This stuff is incredible.
Trump	1	We broke down the doors of Washington backrooms, where deals were cut to close our companies, give away your jobs, shut down our factories, and surrender your sovereignty and your very way of life, and we've ended it.
Trump	1	I want to thank Secretary Ross who's here with us today and Secretary Acosta.
Trump	1	 On September 11th, 2001, America suffered the worst terrorist attacks in our history.
Trump	1	If you look at Foxconn in Wisconsin, they're coming in.
Trump	1	But who's better to protect our students than the teachers that love them?
Trump	1	We would never say that."
Trump	1	And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.
Trump	1	This tax won't help you much."
Trump	1	Jeannette.
Trump	1	Joe endorsed Hillary 100%, and he got along with her even better after she came out with a statement that she wants to destroy coal and coal companies.
Trump	1	Again, I'm for America first.
Trump	1	Bring down the cost.
Trump	1	Much of it hasn't been used in a long time.
Trump	1	And I brought a star along and [Inaudible] became an even bigger star during that horrible situation with Brett Kavanaugh.
Trump	1	But I do have to ask you: What the hell is going on in Chicago?
Trump	1	And then I listened.
Trump	1	Our laws are so crazy.
Trump	1	I said, "Don't do it.
Trump	1	You're all very lucky in Ohio.
Trump	1	That's why you have to get to the polls.
Trump	1	We obviously, we found the magic wand.
Trump	1	We have a tiny majority.
Trump	1	And you take a look at the scene, where thousands and thousands of people are marching, and then you hear that Democrats want to have open borders, and they want to invite caravan after caravan into our country, overwhelming your schools, your hospitals, and your communities.
Trump	1	Rick Allen.
Trump	1	We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way.
Trump	1	We will make American strong again.
Trump	1	And I don't know if you saw the one is coming up, that's a big caravan.
Trump	1	This election is about safety.
Trump	1	You know, when I came into office, Iran was like this big power, big power.
Trump	1	No much more.
Trump	1	But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout.
Trump	1	And then Trump went there all by himself and we won.
Trump	1	And we're giving our brave war fighters the tools, resources, and equipment they need to defeat any enemy that dares to threaten our people.
Trump	1	Without what we've done, you could have never had this approved.
Trump	1	If I lost every single remaining vote, it was impossible to catch me.
Trump	1	Everyone in this room is benefiting.
Trump	1	No tax.
Trump	1	Guy has also hired 30 new employees to help meet customer demand, which is actually booming right now.
Trump	1	But it's got to be peace through strength, not weakness.
Trump	1	That was where you have the privilege of paying a lot of money so that you don't have to pay for health care because you're not going to get it, OK?
Trump	1	Many decades.
Trump	1	You have to see.
Trump	1	They said, that's a good idea.
Trump	1	They are successful, they are the smartest people, they are the toughest people, they are the most loyal people.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	[Applause] Come here.
Trump	1	And we are doing it with American steel and American pride.
Trump	1	And they say, "No, no he's the one that causes the fright."
Trump	1	It's all about the cars.
Trump	1	Director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture, Steve Wellman.
Trump	1	But I do like that.
Trump	1	Sounds good.
Trump	1	But we're changing it all around, and you see it already.
Trump	1	They got what they wanted and we are producing and we did it together.
Trump	1	We take the 151 and now we make 100, so we flipped it like $250 billion with one signature.
Trump	1	That's very soon going to be 600,000 manufacturing jobs since my election.
Trump	1	And we started working – and for $400,000, we actually have a very beautiful American Embassy in Jerusalem — really beautiful.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And they don't understand what you're saying because they don't speak the language.
Trump	1	And criminal justice reform -- I have to say, people are getting out of prison.
Trump	1	Under the previous administration, by the way.
Trump	1	And they want to look good.
Trump	1	They look good.
Trump	1	The Democrat Party is radical socialism, Venezuela, and open borders.
Trump	1	It will be a disaster.
Trump	1	Cindy Axne is totally controlled by Pelosi and the extreme Washington liberals who are bankrolling her campaign, totally bankrolling her campaign.
Trump	1	But we understand it, right?
Trump	1	We'll pay.
Trump	1	You know, part of the problem the country had and one of the reasons our jobs are doing so well, our companies are doing so well, wages are going up because we had regulations which were staggering.
Trump	1	And we are all fighting to defend these values in this election.
Trump	1	I'm a happy person.
Trump	1	They wouldn't announce it.
Trump	1	But if for any reason -- if for any reason you did, you can pick out six, seven, eight other jobs.
Trump	1	They'd go back out.
Trump	1	For Choice, we change that one.
Trump	1	The damage is incredible.
Trump	1	With your help, and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
Trump	1	Democrats believe that they're entitled to power, and they have been blind in a blind rage ever since, boy, they lost the 2016 -- they've gone loco.
Trump	1	Illegal immigration costs our country more than $100 billion every year.
Trump	1	I think it's now 38 years old, this poll.
Trump	1	Ever!
Trump	1	People love it.
Trump	1	You had the most one-sided, uneven, unfair trade deals.
Trump	1	And we're coming out with another plan with Alex Azar.
Trump	1	We can have all the ideas we want, but we have some really bad people, bad people that are running for office.
Trump	1	Zippo.
Trump	1	You like that.
Trump	1	Joe?
Trump	1	Stand up when I call your name, or come up here if you want.
Trump	1	Now, I had to do it, because he was bragging about his political career.
Trump	1	Hey, I understand -- and because of civil service, which is very powerful.
Trump	1	He said, "This man, he loves the people of Ohio.
Trump	1	I said, "Yeah, those are the people that know what the hell they're doing."
Trump	1	Both from Brooklyn.
Trump	1	That was when it was a little bit less in vogue than it is today.
Trump	1	The stale debates of the and finally come together as one nation under God.
Trump	1	But if you go to New York, you get sued, and people are afraid to go to New York.
Trump	1	Let 'em do it.
Trump	1	Take a look at what happened to our premiums.
Trump	1	More than 3.5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.
Trump	1	One minute.
Trump	1	Hopefully people will look at us and they'll say, "Let's pass.
Trump	1	And we're proud of it.
Trump	1	Some of these drug dealers will kill thousands of people during their lifetime -- thousands of people -- and destroy many more lives than that.
Trump	1	They knew it.
Trump	1	We have a good relationship.
Trump	1	You can't fake it.
Trump	1	Get going.
Trump	1	And I don't have enough time so many people in the house, but the people I went for, like in Kentucky, Matt Barr, he's -- he won.
Trump	1	I refuse to say it.
Trump	1	You win.
Trump	1	Did somebody say Spartacus?
Trump	1	So I said OK.
Trump	1	We've come a long way, but we could have been in something.
Trump	1	The actor that nobody ever heard of, nobody ever -- I said, "Who the hell is that?"
Trump	1	And they really have.
Trump	1	We're talking about it now and we have.
Trump	1	We're not going to let people undo the incredible job that we've done over the last almost-two-year period.
Trump	1	Yet, thanks to a powerful border wall and El Paso, Texas it's one of America's safest cities now.
Trump	1	They're not in favor of West Virginia.
Trump	1	[Laughter] That's why I always say "I think it's around..." With a Republican Congress, we've added more than 4 million new jobs since Election Day, and lifted 4 million Americans off of food stamps.
Trump	1	I didn't know too much.
Trump	1	He's a totally brilliant scholar, who has devoted his life to the law, he is a loving husband, a devoted father, and a faithful public servant, and he always has been.
Trump	1	But to win, we have to out-work the opposition.
Trump	1	Sorry, you guys.
Trump	1	Now, I have to say this.
Trump	1	He loves your industry too much.
Trump	1	We need DeWine.
Trump	1	They said he never quits, he never gives up.
Trump	1	It keeps the law enforcement safe, like trucks that are armored and things like that, so they didn't want to give it because they thought it presented a wrong image.
Trump	1	Four billion.
Trump	1	I think they're making us look better person.
Trump	1	But three weeks ago she was talking about, she wants to raise everybody's taxes.
Trump	1	They didn't have it.
Trump	1	I -- I say all of us, not just me.
Trump	1	We love border security.
Trump	1	You may even make it all the way out to the legendary combat-training school known as Top Gun in bruce's beloved hometown in Nevada.
Trump	1	That's one of the things helping us with the jobs.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] I've been -- I have to do this before we introduce Lou.
Trump	1	Americans won the race to the moon, and we will now win the race to Mars.
Trump	1	I've been doing this for a long time.
Trump	1	And, as I said, we have the one Supreme Court judge.
Trump	1	At first we had to sort of give it a little thought.
Trump	1	No, people were having a farm, they loved their children, and they want to leave it to their children.
Trump	1	Instead of apologize, that's -- what we're doing is we're winning.
Trump	1	I said, do it, do it, and if you can buy it from Europe, because their system, like remember, I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to, and I'd say, the system is rigged?
Trump	1	They had no problem.
Trump	1	And I've been saying it.
Trump	1	And women and men -- and I consider them totally equal, so I'm not going to say it's harder.
Trump	1	They did incredible work.
Trump	1	He's not doing too well, but that's OK. You've got to hand it to him, he's up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic.
Trump	1	So we call it the Tax Cut and Jobs Bill.
Trump	1	It's incredible; they've been talking about this for years and years and years.
Trump	1	But you have to see what's happening with the steel industry.
Trump	1	I want to watch that one.
Trump	1	And I went, you know, to Paduchik.
Trump	1	Rick Scott, I said, oh I know he wants Okeechobee.
Trump	1	Done a fantastic job.
Trump	1	They live in the basement of mom and dad's home.
Trump	1	So we're joined and honored tonight to be with a very special woman.
Trump	1	I don't know why Obama left that.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Great job.
Trump	1	They'll say, What do you think of that?
Trump	1	Please, sit down.
Trump	1	He said the hard part was coming down because you'd get killed if you missed.
Trump	1	It's another thing if we're dealing with countries that are loaded with cash, make a fortune, and we're defending them for a tiny fraction of what it costs.
Trump	1	And Florida together, we will make America wealthy again.
Trump	1	And you look at what we've done, just through management of healthcare, and it's not good stuff but we've keep the premiums down to the lowest number that they've been.
Trump	1	America is safer, and peace is more possible because of the incredible courage and devotion of every patriot here tonight.
Trump	1	We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms.
Trump	1	It was the gift.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] So, we had a great meeting with Russia, we had a great meeting with Putin, although they just hammered, because they really thought I was soft.
Trump	1	And they say sir, sir, we're losing the state of Montana.
Trump	1	He voted for amnesty for illegals and against the border wall on numerous occasions.
Trump	1	They pay essentially no tax.
Trump	1	I shouldn't tell you this, but I used to travel a lot to Kentucky.
Trump	1	Claire McCaskill -- when I read about this sitting a beautiful, beautiful house called the White House.
Trump	1	And we want to end catch-and-release.
Trump	1	A vote for David's far-left opponent, Cindy "Tax Me"...
Trump	1	We opened it up in four months.
Trump	1	It's thriving.
Trump	1	Remember, they were the jobs that won't happen anymore.
Trump	1	We always have to be in the lead and thanks to our focus on burden sharing, $100 billion, more dollars, will be coming this year to NATO, think of that.
Trump	1	Everybody knows what they are, asylum asylum.
Trump	1	I said, "That's the guy that lied about -- in the worst -- in the history of our country.
Trump	1	They go into the -- they call them nests, MS-13, killers.
Trump	1	And they've got Trump banners and Trump hats and Trump tattoos.
Trump	1	I like you guys, I tell you, but I could be one of you.
Trump	1	She gets special treatment under the Justice Department.
Trump	1	He actually said, "Why is the president giving so much to North Korea?"
Trump	1	I am asking every citizen from every party, every background, every race, color, and creed, to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division, destruction, and to unite behind our proud, noble, and righteous destiny as Americans.
Trump	1	Nobody has in this country's history and in most countries histories there has never been anything like what we did in 2016 on November 8.
Trump	1	You know that's name causing -- because now even the liberals are saying take a test.
Trump	1	And US Steel is bringing back many plants.
Trump	1	Your people and the people that preceded you in West Virginia were the Carpenters and the coal miners, the ministers, the metal workers, the farmers, the factory workers, but they all had one thing in common.
Trump	1	Let's take MAGA and throw it out.
Trump	1	Look, we love Canada.
Trump	1	And the funny thing is so, look, Lindsey was just telling me every other Republican it would have been very tough.
Trump	1	Oh, that's beautiful.
Trump	1	And I appreciate it.
Trump	1	We're standing up for your values.
Trump	1	We have, if you look at it, we have the immigration but we have a lot -- we have the crime.
Trump	1	I said to Raisin Cane and a couple of other generals that were there, "These guys are central casting like from a movie, except better.
Trump	1	And people now are able to go around and look for jobs.
Trump	1	Dan.
Trump	1	The good-looking guy over there, that's good.
Trump	1	Now, they sign a piece of paper.
Trump	1	I don't see much of a bald spot there.
Trump	1	I don't know what the weight is.
Trump	1	OK, wait a minute.
Trump	1	We need people to run these great companies that are coming in.
Trump	1	And Congressman David Kustoff.
Trump	1	We're going to go over them.
Trump	1	Okay.
Trump	1	Oh hello, fellas.
Trump	1	And something else happened on top of that.
Trump	1	But everybody has to go out and vote for Greg.
Trump	1	Think of it -- one year.
Trump	1	Should have been done a long time before.
Trump	1	That was -- sounded good.
Trump	1	Now, Amy supports a socialist takeover of your health care, which by the way means your taxes are going to triple if you're lucky.
Trump	1	[Inaudible] That's right.
Trump	1	This is finding, truly, a needle in a haystack when you think about it.
Trump	1	And then you had Spartacus, right?
Trump	1	But he said, these are incredible people.
Trump	1	NASA, space agency, all of a sudden it's back, you notice?
Trump	1	You know why?
Trump	1	Never in the history of our country has something taken place like took place during this election.
Trump	1	I was with him in the hospital who raced into gunfire during the horrific anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue.
Trump	1	They're basically dishonest people -- because, look, let's face it: Whether you like me or not -- if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges -- it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges.
Trump	1	Is she still running for president, Brian?
Trump	1	And it's called Catch and Release.
Trump	1	[Laughter] We had a good talk.
Trump	1	And we started the wall, and we'll finish the wall, but we have to do it faster.
Trump	1	Not too good.
Trump	1	That's why Democrats want to abolish ICE, the most brave people.
Trump	1	He said, He's going to win.
Trump	1	We should protect people that can't protect themselves and they're getting slaughtered.
Trump	1	The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and open borders.
Trump	1	The choice cannot be any clearer.
Trump	1	And this year, we had an even better meeting, but you never hear that from these folks.
Trump	1	They've been on a mission to resist and obstruct, and destroy, and you see that over the last four days.
Trump	1	The sources don't exist.
Trump	1	And we are cracking down on China's unfair and abusive trade practices.
Trump	1	All over our land, they were dumping steel.
Trump	1	The relationship is ridiculous.
Trump	1	When you had somebody treating our veterans horribly, you couldn't do anything.
Trump	1	We had it beaten, but we got no Democrat votes.
Trump	1	I used to say, it is still rigged, but a lot less rigged we're getting rid of a lot of the rigging rapidly folks.
Trump	1	I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee, they have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state Tennessee, and he said, he was in Pennsylvania with me, a great state, and he said you know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting, people that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.
Trump	1	A lot of love, a lot of love in this room.
Trump	1	That's what this is all about.
Trump	1	He will never get up.
Trump	1	And we have it down to a much lower number.
Trump	1	So you don't get a chance over here to vote for him, so you know what I said?
Trump	1	He got no standing ovations," because they never sat down.
Trump	1	I couldn't wait to get him out.
Trump	1	[Applause] They've been trying to do that from before the days of Ronald Reagan.
Trump	1	Thank you very much, law enforcement.
Trump	1	And we will always fight on to victory.
Trump	1	And I'm telling you, he was crying.
Trump	1	Incredible people.
Trump	1	No, they just opened up.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	That's what they want to do.
Trump	1	In San Diego, and now they go out and say we didn't want the wall in the first place.
Trump	1	And one of these guys is on television.
Trump	1	And I have a friend who hired prisoners.
Trump	1	Nobody else.
Trump	1	So with companies like Chrysler and Ford and Toyota and Volkswagen all investing heavily in America and heavily in the state of Michigan we think General Motors will soon be doing the same.
Trump	1	Go back 30, 40, 50 years, they would look at us like -- now, we are like, in many cases, a Third World country.
Trump	1	We don't want crime.
Trump	1	Congratulations.
Trump	1	You all know about it.
Trump	1	You'll never be removed."
Trump	1	So what happened is I flew to Iraq.
Trump	1	This barrier is absolutely critical to border security.
Trump	1	Thank you, Rick.
Trump	1	Nobody would believe what's happening.
Trump	1	I don't think we like open borders.
Trump	1	He was so thankful.
Trump	1	Well now we know.
Trump	1	It's about whether we want to continue the amazing progress we've made for America or whether we want to surrender that progress to the forces of extremism and obstruction.
Trump	1	That's not a good answer.
Trump	1	Great job.
Trump	1	So we're blowing them away and that's good because those are the people that love us.
Trump	1	Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.
Trump	1	Which is why he needs to be voted out of office.
Trump	1	I was only going to be one November.
Trump	1	Thank you."
Trump	1	And they're dumping it all over.
Trump	1	But who cares?
Trump	1	Nothing stops you, I can tell you.
Trump	1	You can't make them important.
Trump	1	Democrats even want to give welfare and free health care to anyone who crosses our border.
Trump	1	I'm thrilled to be back in this great state that, by the way, we won very easily in 2016.
Trump	1	He left you for another state.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	As much as you're doing and as good as you're doing, if you look at what's happening, if you look at other countries wanting our coal -- and I'll tell you, which buys a lot of coal from West Virginia.
Trump	1	And I don't mean all of them, because some of the finest people I know are journalists.
Trump	1	Incredible guy.
Trump	1	He didn't vote for anything that we want.
Trump	1	Two years ago, Mordechai and [Inaudible] traveled to Jerusalem, where they prayed at the Western Wall.
Trump	1	Steve.
Trump	1	Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low, and it's going to 63, I believe, probably, next month.
Trump	1	We're reducing the price.
Trump	1	Just remember that.
Trump	1	28 times, "You can keep your doctor."
Trump	1	It took us all about five years to figure out how the hell to pronounce his name.
Trump	1	[Applause] And I told Mexico: Don't send it.
Trump	1	No, I'm just saying it's their choice.
Trump	1	It's a little reminiscent of Ronald Reagan.
Trump	1	Nobody talks about it.
Trump	1	And now they are managing the forests, at least as much as they could.
Trump	1	They're not easy but you did a fantastic job.
Trump	1	And I've been a little bit disappointed with them because everyone else is coming in but General Motors did just announce a $300 million investment at its Orion assembly plant here in Michigan, right now.
Trump	1	We're in the White House.
Trump	1	We will not break.
Trump	1	Here we are.
Trump	1	God bless America.
Trump	1	Maxine Waters.
Trump	1	David Lynch, the great filmmaker, David Lynch, he puts down headline, "Trump could go down..." He's a Hollywood guy.
Trump	1	But he's a good person.
Trump	1	They're tough, and they're smart.
Trump	1	It's not a good -- that's not a good thing to do.
Trump	1	It did everything it had to do.
Trump	1	You're getting the best equipment in the world.
Trump	1	They've been trying to get those two things fixed for many, many decades, many years and we got it fixed.
Trump	1	We've secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion for next year, billion with a b.
Trump	1	The only thing keeping Tester's campaign alive are millions and millions and millions of dollars from outside liberals and radical leftists who couldn't care less about Montana.
Trump	1	And you are the families and faith communities who help thousands of Americans overcome addiction for a new life of freedom.
Trump	1	One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech.
Trump	1	Many farm boys.
Trump	1	We'll be OK, go ahead, take your time.
Trump	1	You need a wand, a magic wand.
Trump	1	Could happen.
Trump	1	 That's such a great song.
Trump	1	It could have never -- and if the Democrat would have gone in, you literally, in my opinion, would have gone into substantially negative numbers.
Trump	1	Could you believe this?
Trump	1	And that's the way we're going to keep it.
Trump	1	Jim, please come up.
Trump	1	You know him?
Trump	1	They were getting parts for aeroplanes going to the aeroplane graveyard.
Trump	1	But I paid them more money than they actually asked for.
Trump	1	Then they said it's 42.
Trump	1	Fake news and the Russian witch hunt?
Trump	1	And on immigration, we have to be very strong.
Trump	1	It's very tough when you have the worst laws on immigration, the worst loopholes.
Trump	1	Somebody just said, your hair looks different today.
Trump	1	[Laughter] She'd bring in Beyonce, and then Jay-Z would get up and use language that was so bad, if I ever used that language I'd be run out of the country.
Trump	1	It's moving.
Trump	1	Did anybody ever hear Strzok?
Trump	1	True.
Trump	1	Who is coming to the United States.
Trump	1	Remember, it's America first.
Trump	1	Jim Jordan, how great is he?
Trump	1	This is going to go so easy, so fast.
Trump	1	Along with two outstanding Supreme Court Judges, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and as you know, Brett Kavanaugh -- who was put through a grinder like nobody has ever been put through a grinder.
Trump	1	What they did was a disgrace.
Trump	1	And you do everything.
Trump	1	As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.
Trump	1	We capture them.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	I shouldn't say this, because -- there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Trump	1	Are you happy?
Trump	1	Where is Steve, by the way?
Trump	1	They don't do anything for us.
Trump	1	Thank you Dave, great job.
Trump	1	So I said, $1 billion?
Trump	1	Thanks to your partnership, last year, our brave ICE agents seized 1 million pounds of narcotics, including almost 7,000 pounds of heroin and more than 2,300 pounds of fentanyl -- saving thousands upon thousands of American lives.
Trump	1	So we have all Jerusalem stone.
Trump	1	We love NASCAR.
Trump	1	We brought it back and brought it back and I'll tell you our country is respected again.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Release them into U.S. communities, right?
Trump	1	I said, "No, try cleaning the floor of the forest a little bit so you don't have four feet of leaves and broken trees that have sit there for 25 years."
Trump	1	I'll get it to you with a -- look at this guy, this guy will do it.
Trump	1	This is the state of Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson.
Trump	1	This is your real choice.
Trump	1	But now this one counts that, it's 100 percent.
Trump	1	To draw on its ancient wisdom.
Trump	1	And our farmers are patriots.
Trump	1	We'll do one a year.
Trump	1	U.S. Steel is now in the early stages, David, of investing over $2 billion in asset revitalization that will invest hundreds of millions of dollars, not just here, but in Pittsburgh, Detroit and Gary, Indiana.
Trump	1	You all right?
Trump	1	A vote for Democrats is a vote for totally open borders.
Trump	1	 Wow.
Trump	1	Whether it's missiles or ships or anything you want to name, we have the greatest in the world.
Trump	1	I don't think anybody is even close in their first two years.
Trump	1	It went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight -- overnight.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	He is a great, great gentleman.
Trump	1	So, Karin is running against a far-left Democrat, Tina Smith, who nobody knows who the hell she is.
Trump	1	And I'll tell you, once we understood each other -- and he's a tough guy and he's a smart guy and he loves this state a lot -- once we really got to know each other and understand, there's no better partner that I had in Washington than Dean Heller.
Trump	1	We understand.
Trump	1	And I'm going to save your Social Security.
Trump	1	You know, he's a very, very successful man before he did this and he did it, and he made a mistake.
Trump	1	Dean Heller.
Trump	1	They have forgotten that our ancestors trounced an empire, tamed a continent, and triumphed over the worst evils in history.
Trump	1	They don't care.
Trump	1	They're going to be in a very dim..." Frankly, if you're not a 30-year-old pilot, you can't See anything.
Trump	1	That's right.
Trump	1	1 student in her class.
Trump	1	These are criminal aliens.
Trump	1	They're eating better now.
Trump	1	They have backed me.
Trump	1	Because this maniac, the governor from Virginia, he comes up and says, "Now the baby is born.
Trump	1	The 101st Airborne leapt into the danger from above, illuminated only by enemy flares, explosions, and burning aircraft.
Trump	1	We're not going to make anything?
Trump	1	You know, when I ran for President, I started hearing, outside of obviously defense and all of that, the most important decision a President can make is the picking of United States Supreme Court justices -- if you're lucky enough to do that.
Trump	1	We'll get the credit.
Trump	1	They didn't use any space, Ben.
Trump	1	We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary achievements that we've made together in -- can you believe it -- less than two years?
Trump	1	That's why I'm taking very bold action to lower the cost of retirement plans so that they can become an affordable option for businesses of all sizes.
Trump	1	Last week I visited with hundreds of American steel workers, who were laid off years ago because other countries were dumping steel all over our country.
Trump	1	And that's a big deal.
Trump	1	You're just never going to see it with Heidi.
Trump	1	From the Bootheel of Missouri, to the beautiful, big sky of Montana, from the deserts of Nevada to the everglades of Florida, from the coal mines of West Virginia to the steel mills of Indiana, and for every family in every city and town across our land, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win and not stop winning.
Trump	1	You'd better be careful, I'll leave here and I'll go run in Israel.
Trump	1	And I didn't save it.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	I'll tell you what, when you read the IG report with these really dishonest people -- and I was never a deep-state guy, but let me tell you, we got some bad people that are doing bad things.
Trump	1	I'll tell you, every foreign leader who comes to see me, almost, they walk in and they start off, Mr. President, congratulations on the incredible success you're having with your economy.
Trump	1	Now, maybe something happens where they come and they say, "We agree, it's been unfair for the last 25 years."
Trump	1	So I will not say that this guy said, "If we didn't have the bullshit."
Trump	1	and it says off-the-record, and I gave a statement, it actually said, and they gave it out, and it's a big story today.
Trump	1	Shockingly, we're going to be helping you out.
Trump	1	A lot of those people are coming back home.
Trump	1	I can't call her...
Trump	1	But you don't have to have regulation that makes it impossible for our country to compete with other countries, and that's what we're doing.
Trump	1	But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God.
Trump	1	How about California?
Trump	1	We need it.
Trump	1	But you can stop them with your votes tomorrow.
Trump	1	They just want to sort of when you're taking what they had away from them.
Trump	1	They're tackling people.
Trump	1	I let you down, I'm sorry.
Trump	1	That's the end of the hair for tonight.
Trump	1	But let's go to a movie and then we'll come home and we'll watch his defeat."
Trump	1	We're never going to have manufacturing jobs anymore.
Trump	1	I just know this, it can disappear very, very quickly.
Trump	1	Tax-Free, no tax, don't worry about it.
Trump	1	 Wow, thank you so much.
Trump	1	It's called, "They want to win."
Trump	1	You know that.
Trump	1	We used to be the leader, but we're going to be the leader again.
Trump	1	He just won South Carolina."
Trump	1	They send us a lot of stuff, no tax.
Trump	1	We can go much higher.
Trump	1	Just so you understand, your delegates, you know what's going on.
Trump	1	We have a great relationship with Chairman Kim.
Trump	1	Their military was hurt.
Trump	1	We have so much happening.
Trump	1	With a brand new U.S-Mexico trade deal, and we'll see what happens with Canada, if they come along, good.
Trump	1	Earlier this month, I announced that we are replacing the horrible, horrible NAFTA deal with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
Trump	1	Then I said, well, wait a minute, I know Montana pretty well.
Trump	1	Thank you, General.
Trump	1	We have your very highly respected, great person, your house speaker, state House speaker, Linda Upmeyer.
Trump	1	Why the hell do so many people come?
Trump	1	Hopefully, in a week or two it will be "history."
Trump	1	One.
Trump	1	Never heard about Category 5s before, a Category 5 is big stuff.
Trump	1	Every day, it's promises made, promises kept.
Trump	1	Who is he?
Trump	1	And David Limbaugh, David, thank you, David.
Trump	1	David was great, David Young.
Trump	1	She's fantastic.
Trump	1	The United States Coast Guard.
Trump	1	You gotta get out of the vote.
Trump	1	But Dianne Feinstein, she had this... She had this letter for months, and she didn't reveal it until everything was finished.
Trump	1	And Representative Greg Pence -- familiar name.
Trump	1	Over the last little more than a year and a half, we've created 3.7 million jobs since election.
Trump	1	You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, "Bye, folks."
Trump	1	we may have to cancel.
Trump	1	We are boldly confronting the opioid and drug addiction, and you know what's happening, drug addiction is the scorch of our country and many other countries, and we have made so much progress, so much progress.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	I think she paid $1.9 million for the genius that gave her the line.
Trump	1	Did you see some court ruled against it the other day?
Trump	1	You know, I don't see -- I mean, maybe I'm wrong.
Trump	1	You have to get out tomorrow.
Trump	1	No, sir, it didn't.
Trump	1	So true.
Trump	1	They're smart.
Trump	1	You're next Agriculture Commissioner Matt Caldwell.
Trump	1	Well done.
Trump	1	"I'll pay you 1 percent."
Trump	1	And they like to say, "Well, Obama helped."
Trump	1	Because he just started.
Trump	1	And first in his class at Yale.
Trump	1	And, you know, honestly, for two weeks, they really covered me well.
Trump	1	We have delivered -- and it was said by one of these gentlemen.
Trump	1	Stand up.
Trump	1	If somebody gets a bad cold, let's assume they come in for a cold, but let's assume it's worse than that.
Trump	1	But not one -- because you're fired, yes.
Trump	1	Now, what we've done in a short period of time -- we're way ahead of schedule, as you know, but we've got it turned and we're starting to really -- it's really getting better and better and we're learning our way around Washington like you wouldn't believe.
Trump	1	[Applause] And my people all said, Oh, that was not nice.
Trump	1	Now, if the government wanted to, I have a feeling they'd be able to stop caravans from forming in those three countries.
Trump	1	Can you believe it?
Trump	1	Like we're doing.
Trump	1	Why isn’t that mentioned?
Trump	1	And had I not won, we would have been in negative -- we wouldn't be at 4.2%.
Trump	1	And if you run, you're going to win.
Trump	1	What's your name?
Trump	1	And, you know, she is.
Trump	1	Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor, you have a governor that invites the whole world to come in to California, we’ll pay for your health care, we’ll pay for … And then you wonder why so many people are coming up.
Trump	1	Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California.
Trump	1	And then the Indians got together, and they said, "We don't want her.
Trump	1	When I was growing up, we had things called vocational schools.
Trump	1	And I said it's time.
Trump	1	I generally have been working for getting great senators elected, been working with David and everybody else, but we're going for the senators.
Trump	1	Right to try.
Trump	1	Youth unemployment has just reached its lowest rate in nearly a half a century, 50 years.
Trump	1	I never..." First time in the history of drug companies that they've done that.
Trump	1	But we now have the right to go after them.
Trump	1	And we're doing good steel, quality steel.
Trump	1	And if I could, I'd like to have her just come up for a few seconds and say a few words, then we're going to make a trip.
Trump	1	You know, we're learning from the steel industry because, as I said before, it's one of the hottest industries anywhere.
Trump	1	How about Steve Doocy?
Trump	1	So Representative Omar blamed the United States for the terrorist attacks on our country, saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people's affairs.
Trump	1	And Rand Paul and Mitch, they stuck with him.
Trump	1	He could be nasty.
Trump	1	And she was so happy and her father was so happy because they don't forget.
Trump	1	You still have empty buildings all over the country from NAFTA, so I didn't want to use the name "NAFTA."
Trump	1	 Thank you.
Trump	1	It's happening all over.
Trump	1	We put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance.
Trump	1	Hi, Steve.
Trump	1	They went after our companies and they stole our intellectual property like it never even belonged to us, like it wasn't our idea in the first place.
Trump	1	Tens of thousands were outside.
Trump	1	You have a lot of phony stuff going on.
Trump	1	We want them out.
Trump	1	They went to move to Mexico and other places, but they moved to Mexico.
Trump	1	Together we have made extraordinary progress.
Trump	1	So he did that.
Trump	1	[Applause, Laughter] We want a great country.
Trump	1	Now the Democrats -- or as some people would says, the Dims -- the Dims -- who says that?
Trump	1	That's how bad it is.
Trump	1	We're going to make great deals.
Trump	1	So just hang in there, folks.
Trump	1	Bernie.
Trump	1	That will do things... No country is even close.
Trump	1	If he was playing today, he'd make a trillion dollars and he'd stand for the flag too, I'd tell you.
Trump	1	My original speech.
Trump	1	In this election, and by the way, we want that wall.
Trump	1	And they said, Well, what is that?
Trump	1	One more speech.
Trump	1	And opening up new markets to export -- many, many new markets are being opened up.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	And we have a building on the site.
Trump	1	Like, to say, "Could you leave us alone, please?"
Trump	1	This is the greatest economy that we've had in our history, the best.
Trump	1	Hillary wasn't going to approve it.
Trump	1	They got me making like four speeches, do you believe this?
Trump	1	I said, "The person's very sick.
Trump	1	Because I'd read these horrible statistics -- highest crime, worst education, all the bad things; lowest home ownership -- about African Americans.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	And we really had a big night.
Trump	1	I heard the price.
Trump	1	You know, we've now appointed 148, think of this, federal judges, 148.
Trump	1	Look at this.
Trump	1	We did.
Trump	1	He's got the make farmers great again hat.
Trump	1	I'm especially thrilled to introduce a terrific Pennsylvania congressmen.
Trump	1	And I said, Well, it doesn't make sense.
Trump	1	And four years sounded so long away and now four years is coming up with two and a half years and no administration has done as much as we have in the first three years, every.
Trump	1	It's like a war zone.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Somebody said, who do you like best?
Trump	1	I think it's great.
Trump	1	And I'm proud to announce that nearly 1,000 farm groups have already endorsed it this morning.
Trump	1	No, I, you know, I'm looking, I keep looking, I just see things, and just -- they're true, but they're not quite as exciting.
Trump	1	Also, we have your senator, who's a special friend of mine.
Trump	1	You will take us to new levels.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	He will be a winner.
Trump	1	You don't want us to put -- explain that to me, please.
Trump	1	And just think of what that would be.
Trump	1	He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper.
Trump	1	So, in the last administration, President Obama signed the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty.
Trump	1	But they all had one thing in common.
Trump	1	It's the Academy Awards.
Trump	1	Now, if you're thinking about voting Democrat, don't go out today and vote.
Trump	1	If you don't want to be saying the words, "Ladies and gentlemen, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi," for the next two years... ... you got to get out tomorrow and you have to get out.
Trump	1	But they came back, and they said, "It was terrible."
Trump	1	They wouldn't even be talking to us because it's so one-sided.
Trump	1	I want to introduce a very special person, a tremendous talent.
Trump	1	But they could take apart an engine blindfolded, put it back together 15 different ways.
Trump	1	It's called a nationalist.
Trump	1	Our movement is for everyone and belongs to anyone who wants to build a better future.
Trump	1	We're putting our people first.
Trump	1	That’s right.
Trump	1	I promise -- I promise 2024, I leave.
Trump	1	And the job you did -- great guy.
Trump	1	Thank you, fellas.
Trump	1	What a man he is.
Trump	1	And together we have made extraordinary progress, and we're just getting started.
Trump	1	[Applause] Right?
Trump	1	Last year alone -- and Ohio was just too smart.
Trump	1	And you have some good people over there, too, I have to be honest, but you got some bad people.
Trump	1	Every Republican -- I used an expression.
Trump	1	We're respected.
Trump	1	But keep America great is very important, because it's true, because everything we do they can destroy very quickly if the wrong people get into office.
Trump	1	I bet you I have 2,000 pages of stuff, more.
Trump	1	We have been blessed by God with the greatest nation on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	They said, "It's one of the greatest miracles we've ever seen, because we had another year to live -- it was gone."
Trump	1	I had a very nice life.
Trump	1	Take a guess.
Trump	1	So I told you before the lowest unemployment rates in the history of our country for African-American great citizens.
Trump	1	And what we're doing -- [Applause] -- what we're doing -- we give hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to countries.
Trump	1	Why are you buying all of this gas and paying Russia billions and billions of dollars for your energy?
Trump	1	[Audience Chants USA] Our fallen warriors are finally coming home to lay at rest in American soil.
Trump	1	Thanks, Mike.
Trump	1	I'll tell you what -- that Panhandle got hit hard, and a piece of Georgia got hit.
Trump	1	He's going to fight for you, Matt Rosendale.
Trump	1	And, you know, whatever it was -- 18,000 -- when you have nobody, it's a little scary-looking.
Trump	1	I mean, I love Saudi Arabia.
Trump	1	We seriously use it, right?
Trump	1	And, every day, we're working to deliver for America's farmers just as they work every day to deliver for us.
Trump	1	I said, David, I can't do it.
Trump	1	I hope that stay that way.
Trump	1	We will defend Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors.
Trump	1	"Yes, sir.
Trump	1	Dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity.
Trump	1	But I'm not going to bore you with it.
Trump	1	You've got to get out there.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] You know, there's about 12 of them.
Trump	1	Our police have been incredible and we want to thank them too, because I'll tell you why.
Trump	1	If the children aren't good children don't, leave them to somebody else.
Trump	1	And the reason I was very cognizant because I was supposed to cut the ribbon of the embassy in London.
Trump	1	They got away with it with the politicians that didn't know what the hell they were doing.
Trump	1	I have a lot of respect for the Chief; I know the Chief.
Trump	1	By the way, America is being respected again.
Trump	1	Got to be smart.
Trump	1	You look at what's happened.
Trump	1	I refused to call it NAFTA because NAFTA was such a horrible deal.
Trump	1	Those are beautiful skies.
Trump	1	That was fast.
Trump	1	Our economy is soaring, our jobs are booming, factories are pouring back into our country.
Trump	1	After years of -- but a fair deal.
Trump	1	They will make that into the single greatest event that our country has ever seen.
Trump	1	So here it is.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Adam, thank you.
Trump	1	I didn't say it in a long time.
Trump	1	We have to protect our law enforcement.
Trump	1	Did anybody like that one?
Trump	1	And they and other nations would take these beautiful, incredible secrets -- no different than computers and other things -- and they'd use them, and they'd take them, and they wouldn't pay for them.
Trump	1	And thanks to our tariffs that we put on steel that was coming in, and they were dumping it all over the place and destroying our steel companies and our aluminum industry.
Trump	1	So we're landing his big, beautiful Air Force One and I'm saying, "Major, I don't see a runway."
Trump	1	And most importantly, we've eliminated the individual mandate.
Trump	1	[Laughter] "No wind out today.
Trump	1	Can you imagine if I went down, the press would have a field day for weeks and weeks.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	I don't want to do it, either.
Trump	1	That will be a great team.
Trump	1	Okay?
Trump	1	Republicans are the party of safety, and we are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs.
Trump	1	And not only in the energy business, in other businesses also.
Trump	1	And never, ever stop reaching for greatness.
Trump	1	It's sad.
Trump	1	Under Republican leadership, America is booming.
Trump	1	Very much respected.
Trump	1	True.
Trump	1	They'll say we just went from 350 million people to 700 million people, and it all took place over a period of three months.
Trump	1	Together, we're taking back our country, returning power to where it belongs.
Trump	1	Four stars, four stars... Marines.
Trump	1	And that number is soon going to reach 10 million Americans, including 60,000 Americans who will have access to apprenticeships and on-the-job training thanks to the National Electrical Contractors Association.
Trump	1	And we will always fight on to victory.
Trump	1	You know, if a foot hits the ground, we're not allowed to say, hey, go back.
Trump	1	I'm not paying it.
Trump	1	You can look at China.
Trump	1	You come in on merit.
Trump	1	We're one family.
Trump	1	We can't envision it.
Trump	1	The Paris Climate, who wouldn't do that, except it's horrible for us -- great for other countries but horrible for us.
Trump	1	We will never surrender.
Trump	1	And we're going to do this quickly, but it's just important that you get out and vote.
Trump	1	It was a lot of garbage that looked like steel.
Trump	1	Kevin Brady is working on it.
Trump	1	He had like 502 people according to the people that count crowds.
Trump	1	Old-fashioned.
Trump	1	We're going to have a major news conference, probably at the White House, in about a month, because all of you people -- and I'm talking about prescription drugs, not necessarily the drugs that we're talking about here.
Trump	1	It will be the election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, tax cuts.
Trump	1	When you look at the drugs that are pouring across from Mexico, if it stopped a small percentage, and it won't, it'll stop a large percentage, it would pay for itself in a matter of weeks.
Trump	1	This is a big seven forty -- Air Force One.
Trump	1	Are you having a good time?"
Trump	1	And I have a down now to two years.
Trump	1	So that's great for your children.
Trump	1	These smugglers know these rules and regulations better than the people that drew them.
Trump	1	And that's -- in all fairness it's not like an independent -- that's against a Democrat.
Trump	1	You have people that say: oh it's, okay, when we close the factory here and we buy steel from some country way far away.
Trump	1	I don't think it's terrible.
Trump	1	We're pretty good at that, right, and we got it approved.
Trump	1	The only thing more packed is outside, trying to get in.
Trump	1	But they love our country, and they're tough people, but they love our country.
Trump	1	In that case, much less important, because there's nothing so important as protection on our military.
Trump	1	Let's keep it going.
Trump	1	That's what it is.
Trump	1	They're coming back.
Trump	1	They're the party of crime.
Trump	1	That was one of the great evenings in the history of our country.
Trump	1	Jay Baldwin is a Boiler Operator and a proud Army veteran.
Trump	1	They have riots.
Trump	1	You don't have to worry about anything.
Trump	1	I think I'd do very well.
Trump	1	And Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, thank you.
Trump	1	I mean a lot of missiles going up, a lot of rockets going up, a lot of nuclear testing.
Trump	1	It's -- it's actually incredible.
Trump	1	No Trump is stopping it.
Trump	1	And Accountability.
Trump	1	On the site setback, which they want for safety, setback is a building, and the building is nice, but the best location.
Trump	1	And guess what you have now?
Trump	1	We can talk about taxes, and I'll be here, veto, veto, veto.
Trump	1	Fantastic job.
Trump	1	[Audience chants USA] Democrats also support the insane policy of catch-and-release, which has created our border crisis, our certainly helped.
Trump	1	John, stand up.
Trump	1	What the hell were you people thinking when you approved these deals?
Trump	1	No, it's just -- I got out and I'm looking -- I've been here many times -- but I got out and I'm looking -- I say, that really is big sky.
Trump	1	And we have a good relationship.
Trump	1	Patrick, please come up, Patrick.
Trump	1	And it's been an honor.
Trump	1	He's out."
Trump	1	And it's no surprise that in California -- and I don't want to single them out, but they have a train going up now -- you know, this fast train?
Trump	1	I'm sorry, folks.
Trump	1	We protect countries with our military; they don't pay us.
Trump	1	We believe our citizens deserve a government that is loyal to them.
Trump	1	How about Tiger, the comeback he's -- right?
Trump	1	Everybody comes in.
Trump	1	Thank you, Mexico, great.
Trump	1	You know, it's a big statement and they're oftentimes crying.
Trump	1	You've got to do it.
Trump	1	We love it.
Trump	1	Where is Phil?
Trump	1	Keep America great.
Trump	1	You know, the last time I endorsed somebody, as you know, was Katie and I was in Singapore.
Trump	1	We all share the same heart.
Trump	1	It'll all happen.
Trump	1	We're now the party of the American family and we're the party of the American dream.
Trump	1	And we're not going to lose our businesses anymore.
Trump	1	They're fake.
Trump	1	I heard yesterday it started, and he's like my best friend, President Trump this, President Trump that.
Trump	1	The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years.
Trump	1	But when you look at what we're doing, it's very simple.
Trump	1	You see what's happening.
Trump	1	So I am asking every citizen from every party, community, background, race, color, religion and creed for the honor of your support.
Trump	1	From the awe-inspiring F-35 fighter in Texas to the Ford-class aircraft carriers in Virginia -- we’re now building the largest aircraft carrier anywhere in the world.
Trump	1	They're brilliant, in many ways.
Trump	1	We've already started it.
Trump	1	He has been a great, great governor.
Trump	1	Wages are rising and you know it's -- it's been incredible.
Trump	1	And they grab them by the neck and they throw them the hell out of our country or they throw them into jail.
Trump	1	We then have to ask them a couple of questions.
Trump	1	And ICE goes up there, and they walk in like it's another day in the office.
Trump	1	Not a lot of notice.
Trump	1	The Rio Grande, it's happening, go check it out.
Trump	1	It's like, they're people, too.
Trump	1	He got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of England by a British vessel and her four dozen guns.
Trump	1	How are you doing?
Trump	1	Yes, a long time ago, when I was young.
Trump	1	Alex, thank you.
Trump	1	And we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem.
Trump	1	[Applause, Audience chants USA] And we put our large, beautiful hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, right?
Trump	1	And therefore, we are paying for the system, sir.
Trump	1	No more.
Trump	1	They're opening up eight plants, eight.
Trump	1	You got to vote.
Trump	1	We did it once and now we will do it again, and this time we're going to finish the job, and this time should be a lot easier because we have done so much with our military, with our vets, with the Second Amendment, with our regulations, with the biggest tax cut in history, with getting rid of so many different problems, so many different things, including, by the way, the individual mandate in Obamacare, one of the worst things anybody's ever had to live through.
Trump	1	We're also replacing one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever done, although I happen to think that the WTO is not so good either, we're replacing NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that everybody is loving.
Trump	1	Go outside and take a look outside.
Trump	1	And equally remarkable is that they wanted to close it.
Trump	1	And it is true -- I mean, you talk central casting.
Trump	1	Democrats' plan to destroy healthcare, also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.
Trump	1	You want to see Georgia prosperity end quickly?
Trump	1	We want money for our military.
Trump	1	MS-13, they're tough, but they're not tough like our guys.
Trump	1	It strains public resources, and drives down jobs and wages.
Trump	1	And just to finish up, you vote for Josh, you're going to reduce your taxes, you're going to substantially reduce crime.
Trump	1	Looking good.
Trump	1	I haven't given anything.
Trump	1	You have no more death tax to pay.
Trump	1	Wasn't so easy to find, but he was looking.
Trump	1	What he did to that man...
Trump	1	There has never been a case where more red flags have been shown-swift action is taken by the authorities.
Trump	1	To hell with them.
Trump	1	[Audience chants Trump] Thank you.
Trump	1	Take your time.
Trump	1	That's not happening.
Trump	1	You know Mexico has the toughest immigration laws in the world.
Trump	1	Others are always asking for, "Give us money.
Trump	1	He's -- we need tough people.
Trump	1	It's so important.
Trump	1	And we're going to get you more.
Trump	1	If it's good for the country, why are they resisting?
Trump	1	Oh, do I look forward to running against them.
Trump	1	I said, "What are you talking about?"
Trump	1	So I go in, and I say, "You've got to buy our stuff.
Trump	1	I can't get rid of that number.
Trump	1	And he got wiped out.
Trump	1	To build a highway in this country would take 17, 18, 20 and even 21 years to get approved.
Trump	1	Nobody thought that would be possible.
Trump	1	Our country has never done better.
Trump	1	Get them to Washington, please, fast.
Trump	1	But they would have never been built.
Trump	1	They want to keep it that way.
Trump	1	And, you know, with respect to North Korea, remember how strong it was?
Trump	1	If I would have said this on the campaign trail, if I would have used 4.2%, you saw it was adjusted upward from 4.1%, 4.2% GDP, the press would have gone after me, they would have said impossible.
Trump	1	And how about our military deals, where we protect rich nations and we don't get reimbursed?
Trump	1	Remember?
Trump	1	Let's all get together.
Trump	1	See, that's the love.
Trump	1	What a group.
Trump	1	Voted to raise your taxes.
Trump	1	They have to come in legally.
Trump	1	And Asian-American and Hispanic-American and women, 65 years.
Trump	1	These are tough people and they're good people, and if we didn't have them we would have problems because you have towns all over the country where people came in through the Obama Administration.
Trump	1	Should I say it?
Trump	1	I would go around and talk, and some people would say, don't say that, it's not nice.
Trump	1	Because the big thing is the cars.
Trump	1	You weren't going to have a steel industry in this country and we need it.
Trump	1	He is going to be an incredible governor, I have no doubt — I have no doubt.
Trump	1	And it's called expensing.
Trump	1	I want to thank another very special man.
Trump	1	Eventually, he earned a PhD, developed a revolutionary variety of high-yield wheat, and he won the Nobel Peace -- well, do you know this?
Trump	1	And we gave our great warriors, I know you have some of them right here.
Trump	1	And Lou Barletta was fighting on behalf of our miners, our mines, our companies, and our beautiful Pennsylvania clean coal.
Trump	1	So I'm going to be nice.
Trump	1	Karin... Karin, do you promise you will not be voting for sanctuary cities, Karin?
Trump	1	You will never be silenced.
Trump	1	Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation.
Trump	1	And the bad news -- somebody said, actually, it looks better than it usually does.
Trump	1	Today, I'm proud to announce another historic step to protect your Second Amendment rights.
Trump	1	But... [Audience chants Lock her up] But I said to these beautiful guys, these -- the West Virginia, big, strong guys, their fathers were in the mines, their grandfathers, their great -- that's what they do.
Trump	1	And the unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years, five-oh.
Trump	1	The United States is committed to a future of peace and stability in the region, including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Trump	1	My secretary, great person, said, yes, sir, I think he said he was a coach.
Trump	1	He didn't need to do this.
Trump	1	You are the elite.
Trump	1	And when the wind doesn't blow, you don't watch television that night.
Trump	1	We're not going to lose that.
Trump	1	That one I didn't expect to be hearing -- released a criminal alien who was recently convicted of raping and battering a very young child.
Trump	1	Canada charges us close to 300% tariffs for dairy products going into Canada, which is essentially saying we don't want your dairy products -- this is a wall.
Trump	1	In just three years, the patriots of Ohio cranked out more than 100,000 military vehicles -- a truly amazing feat that helped give America the power to vanquish tyranny, defeat our enemies, and save freedom for the entire world.
Trump	1	They don't want to do it anymore.
Trump	1	That’s pretty good.
Trump	1	Highest ever recorded.
Trump	1	One of them said to me, "Sir, we weren't late."
Trump	1	We've never had a chance like this.
Trump	1	I said, "No, no, that's not good enough.
Trump	1	Last week I signed in order to defend free speech on college campuses.
Trump	1	We don't build bridges, like, very much anymore.
Trump	1	And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are -- the number is staggering.
Trump	1	You know, who would think?
Trump	1	And by the way with us, we handle it.
Trump	1	See.
Trump	1	[Audience chants Four more years] He's a great guy.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	But African Americans have done better.
Trump	1	We don't have it because our leaders decided not to spend the money.
Trump	1	And everybody said you couldn't get accountability done.
Trump	1	Does that look like the Academy Awards back there?
Trump	1	I'd like to use it all the time, but it only seems to work well in West Virginia, right?
Trump	1	That's what happens.
Trump	1	All red, showing the different sites.
Trump	1	And I saw him, "We'll stop Donald Trump.
Trump	1	 Hello, it's great to be with you.
Trump	1	The steel industry is one of the great things to be talking about.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And I had a hell of a meeting in Iraq.
Trump	1	[Audience chants four more years] Thank you.
Trump	1	I mean, I saw a piece on NBC today.
Trump	1	That's another one, big one for the security of Israel.
Trump	1	We -- we set the record already and we have a lot to go.
Trump	1	These guys are like perfect people.
Trump	1	But obviously, one more trip.
Trump	1	All I know is I want to put my miners back to work.
Trump	1	We are standing up for West Virginia.
Trump	1	We're going to make that actually easier for them -- to help the farmers.
Trump	1	Who pays for it?
Trump	1	The choice in this election could not be more simple.
Trump	1	The plans were old.
Trump	1	And I actually went to my wife, I said, you know, a very smart man just said there's never been a field so talented as this.
Trump	1	But to continue our incredible momentum, you must go out and vote for Rick and Ron.
Trump	1	They're not too happy.
Trump	1	But as soon as she made that decision -- and now, we had the votes, and then he -- like a quarter of a second later.
Trump	1	When does she get over it?
Trump	1	And by the way, Ken, you have my full endorsement, and Angela, your wife, has my full endorsement.
Trump	1	Chain migration.
Trump	1	I have got to tell you, that's pretty good.
Trump	1	And they didn't give us choice.
Trump	1	He is the largest, most beautiful man.
Trump	1	And I will tell you -- Cindy come on up Cindy.
Trump	1	Really big on your Second Amendment.
Trump	1	And, truly, look, he's in good shape.
Trump	1	Nobody -- they don't want you to hear this stuff.
Trump	1	Now they were saying what do you think President Trump had to do with it?
Trump	1	I say, look, if -- if we can't have a fair deal -- we don't need a great deal, we need a fair deal, because NAFTA has just -- they just ripped the heart out of our manufacturing.
Trump	1	Pretty amazing.
Trump	1	Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities that release violent predators and bloodthirsty killers like MS-13 into our communities.
Trump	1	[Applause] I made a lot of money with that phrase.
Trump	1	And you'd think it would be easy, but it wasn't.
Trump	1	The Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran’s treasury, seized valuable portions of the economy, and looted the people’s religious endowments, all to line their own pockets and send their proxies to wage war.
Trump	1	And after years of stagnation, wages are rising fast, with the quickest growth for blue-collar workers.
Trump	1	This has been a spectacular year for you.
Trump	1	We will pass case law, crack down on sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery and chain migration, defend the ballot box for American citizens, and throw vicious MS-13 gangs the hell out of our country, like we're doing right now.
Trump	1	Hundreds of miles.
Trump	1	You were fighting hard.
Trump	1	But we're going to open the embassy in Jerusalem, over and over and over.
Trump	1	And our policy can be summed up in three very simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.
Trump	1	So, thank you.
Trump	1	You know, we're only into about 15 months, but I think I've approved much more than I've promised, and no politician -- I -- really, I have gotten done much more than I promised.
Trump	1	This is Bobby Knight."
Trump	1	I'll protect you.
Trump	1	Because we decided to put the tariffs on dumped steel, mostly from China, what it's done is beyond anybody's -- it's like one of the hot -- hot things.
Trump	1	It's more money going into our system, believe it or not.
Trump	1	We're not touching your Social, we're just going to make it stronger.
Trump	1	They liberated Fallujah and Mosul, and helped liberate and obliterate the ISIS caliphate, just recently, in Syria.
Trump	1	And I'm not just talking about automobile companies.
Trump	1	Steve, thank you very much.
Trump	1	 Hello, America.
Trump	1	And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces.
Trump	1	Forty-four years.
Trump	1	It's amazing what impact that has on people that want to rip off and destroy our industries.
Trump	1	There's this guy.
Trump	1	Come on.
Trump	1	During World War II, America's mothers helped build the greatest arsenal for democracy.
Trump	1	You figure it out.
Trump	1	Two days later, they were saying Hillary Clinton could have done that.
Trump	1	And then it was state after state it was Florida, it was South Carolina, we love South Carolina, right?
Trump	1	We don't like the thinking of the globalists.
Trump	1	And if it did, it would have cost $4.4 billion, so we did it for $400,000, and we're proud of it.
Trump	1	They're all coming back and they're coming back very, very fast.
Trump	1	He doesn't quit.
Trump	1	Where is that guy?
Trump	1	They want to abolish ICE.
Trump	1	We were given a little early morning surprise by one of our own.
Trump	1	You know, the Democrats all know it because five years ago, before I was here, they all wanted it.
Trump	1	If you don't want to be saying Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the next two years... you have to get out and vote for John now, because he's the newcomer.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	Oh, who's calling?
Trump	1	That didn't work out so well for him.
Trump	1	My military folks all over this arena.
Trump	1	Thank you, Jimmy.
Trump	1	And we take theirs, same product, we charge them almost nothing.
Trump	1	That's why I'm here.
Trump	1	You're a dictator who we hate and who's against us.
Trump	1	Our country cannot prevail without those who rally to the famous cry You hail from every background and you come from every walk of life.
Trump	1	But under scenarios, we could have two more, three more, maybe four more.
Trump	1	I don't think the people of Georgia like that.
Trump	1	They want to make a deal.
Trump	1	I can stay it.
Trump	1	And Phil helped with that one, right, Phil?
Trump	1	More Americans are now working than ever before.
Trump	1	I say it.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	 [This is a First Draft of the transcript and has not yet been proofread by humans] Thank you very much.
Trump	1	I said, "Thank you.
Trump	1	You know all about that.
Trump	1	They had that 14 to 18 different sites of confliction.
Trump	1	Do it now or do it on November 6th.
Trump	1	I hate to say it.
Trump	1	Look, you know him.
Trump	1	Vote for Ricketts.
Trump	1	More people are working now than at any time in our history -- 157 million.
Trump	1	The ballad to Herschel Walker.
Trump	1	You have Kevin Cramer running for the Senate.
Trump	1	We proudly confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Trump	1	I don't care what they say.
Trump	1	You know, a lot of places want those things where so many people come in and spend their money.
Trump	1	And I said, There's something going on here.
Trump	1	But we tried this one two years ago.
Trump	1	There's no way there are so many people in line, takes months and months.
Trump	1	ICE is the one that goes in, they go in and they'll attack some of the worst criminals in the world like MS-13, they chop people up, they cut people down, they like knives because they're more painful than a bullet.
Trump	1	That's 1,000 manufacturing jobs every single day.
Trump	1	She got a pass.
Trump	1	That's one of the reasons our companies are all coming back.
Trump	1	In two weeks ago I proudly issued my first veto.
Trump	1	Thank you very much, Jerry.
Trump	1	You can't afford it.
Trump	1	I really mean it; you have to reward them properly.
Trump	1	Together, we are taking back our country, returning power to the American people.
Trump	1	If you have confidence and you know what you're doing, you can't lose.
Trump	1	"Sir, I know nothing, but I can learn."
Trump	1	Because you were closed; this place was closed.
Trump	1	We got to 306.
Trump	1	You go from January to December.
Trump	1	And I have to tell you, though, that this is my third one of these and this is really something.
Trump	1	What the hell does Russia have to do with my campaign?
Trump	1	They'll figure something.
Trump	1	The plan generates an unprecedented $1.5 trillion investment in American infrastructure.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	Billions.
Trump	1	African-American poverty has reached an all-time low.
Trump	1	"Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.
Trump	1	We worked hard on this.
Trump	1	Illegal immigration costs our country hundreds of billions of dollars.
Trump	1	I will say you should never run again.
Trump	1	Oh, this man.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much, Missouri.
Trump	1	And, Mike, we want to thank you for doing this, because it's not easy.
Trump	1	Made in the USA.
Trump	1	Doing a great job.
Trump	1	It's right to try, I love it.
Trump	1	With your help, we are making incredible strides on behalf of the American people and we are just getting started.
Trump	1	Wow, that's a lot of people -- not one?
Trump	1	It was a fake -- it was a fake story.
Trump	1	This state was settled by tough frontier men and strong pioneer women who braved the wilderness to build a life and a home.
Trump	1	They don't want ICE.
Trump	1	And, honestly, I've seen cases where you give it to the wrong person, and you just sit and you just die with it.
Trump	1	They're great companies, and I said -- they raised the price.
Trump	1	And that was some football player.
Trump	1	And I noticed all that beautiful barbed wire going up today.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And one of the commentators -- and I appreciate it -- one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, "Excuse me, he didn't run."
Trump	1	We want that.
Trump	1	Don't -- please don't talk.
Trump	1	Big Jim, you're doing a great job -- stay there, Jim.
Trump	1	Somebody said, "What's the difference between that piece of land and the piece that we were going to spend a fortune to buy?"
Trump	1	But I'm not sure.
Trump	1	We want to -- watch, if they win, they will eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 411,000 Missouri seniors.
Trump	1	What the hell.
Trump	1	I don't.
Trump	1	Great patriots, people that love Texas.
Trump	1	She may be gone.
Trump	1	A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for.
Trump	1	I came back, "I got the greatest idea."
Trump	1	Then you see this guy, like this little schlepper, this is elite?
Trump	1	Thank you, Darling, for that -- this fan with that beautiful Trump hat on, look at that.
Trump	1	We brought back nearly half a million people, and we brought them into the work force and they are so happy.
Trump	1	Yeah, right to try.
Trump	1	The fake news says, "Why aren't you going faster?"
Trump	1	By a lot.
Trump	1	Ivanka, come up.
Trump	1	They don't want to have -- some of these people are just horrible people.
Trump	1	I don't -- I don't want to tempt them too much by telling you things that don't happen anymore to us, because there's no reason for me to tell you, but when you see some of the things that happened four years ago and six years ago and eight years ago, you take a look at what happened and you take a look at what happens now, where we took that horrible Iran deal and we terminated it, and you look at what's going on.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	And the steel mills need metallurgic coal, and those coal miners are working and the steel workers are working, and our whole country is working.
Trump	1	You know, it's not about politics but think of that from a political standpoint.
Trump	1	That's the way the system works.
Trump	1	I know it's a governor's race and I can't do it for the governors because I'm trying to get our senators in.
Trump	1	If they want us to do the fighting, they also have to pay a price -- and sometimes that's also a monetary price -- so we're not the suckers of the world.
Trump	1	With a single sheet of parchment and 56 signatures, America began the greatest political journey in human history.
Trump	1	But one of them says we want to hire 5,000 more judges.
Trump	1	Nobody thought we could get it.
Trump	1	Yeah, I'm a politician.
Trump	1	So these drug companies -- and I do appreciate Pfizer and Novartis and so many others, they really did, they dropped it down.
Trump	1	As Santa Ana's men watched from a distance, those brave Texans raised a flag for all to see, and you know what it said.
Trump	1	And it was put by a Republican [Inaudible].
Trump	1	He woke up like what is it, a year and a half, two years later he's now apologizing because he humanized me and he really hurt himself.
Trump	1	No, thank you.
Trump	1	I was, I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country.
Trump	1	Could you please pay a little bit more money?
Trump	1	They'd say, wow, that was a good success.
Trump	1	Jean-Claude -- he's the head of the European Union -- I said, "Jean-Claude" -- he's tough and smart, smart, really tough.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	And we all do.
Trump	1	We got rid of the individual mandate.
Trump	1	And congratulations on really, so far, doing a really fantastic job.
Trump	1	It's what we're going.
Trump	1	Why are they upset by that?
Trump	1	A guy comes in -- stone-cold killer in many cases.
Trump	1	The people are smart.
Trump	1	They're finally turned!
Trump	1	Relax.
Trump	1	But he's going to vote for Schumer.
Trump	1	When Espy was in Congress, he even sponsored legislation alongside Nancy Pelosi to provide taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens.
Trump	1	 Every day at 5:23, I feel like she's going to come through that door, but I know she's not.
Trump	1	Great.
Trump	1	You know, I tell you to sit down because otherwise they'll say he got no standing ovations.
Trump	1	Thank you, everybody.
Trump	1	You know, we want to be nice and we all have a big heart.
Trump	1	And this happened in New Hampshire.
Trump	1	Or "Keep America Great".
Trump	1	And that is why America is winning like never, ever before.
Trump	1	Here we are, less than two years, we've put two of them on.
Trump	1	They said, you couldn't get Claire out of there.
Trump	1	And you watch what's going to happen with jobs, and you watch what's going to happen with price.
Trump	1	Didn't touch it.
Trump	1	Thank you, Gregg.
Trump	1	That's a big deal.
Trump	1	I could tell you so many of these stories.
Trump	1	We don't like that.
Trump	1	All three, thank you very much.
Trump	1	I want them to go with this stuff.
Trump	1	They want to give them the right to vote.
Trump	1	A disgrace.
Trump	1	You don't have to pay the estate tax any longer.
Trump	1	 Wow.
Trump	1	You are more loyal.
Trump	1	But I asked a young, bright staffer of mine, why are they so filled with this much hatred?
Trump	1	I don't know what's going on.
Trump	1	That's what we have to do -- you have to know who to use.
Trump	1	The fact is, after years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country.
Trump	1	I may even move to California to get free health care.
Trump	1	When they weren't so good, I wouldn't mention it, right?
Trump	1	Look at this guy.
Trump	1	They wanted to deport this person.
Trump	1	What an impact that's had.
Trump	1	Thank you very much, Mississippi.
Trump	1	You know, a poll came out the other day, Rasmussen.
Trump	1	We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military and we gave our great warriors and you have some of them right here.
Trump	1	I knew that night that his wife loved him, because she was crying like I've never seen a woman cry before.
Trump	1	You'll want to have him on your side.
Trump	1	Who knows?
Trump	1	Jeff?
Trump	1	My only special interest is you, the citizens of the United States.
Trump	1	I said, yeah.
Trump	1	[Applause] We like that.
Trump	1	We are going to win anyway.
Trump	1	Lovely place, lovely place.
Trump	1	Governor Ricketts.
Trump	1	Maybe we don't want to complicate it."
Trump	1	And he said, "What are you going to speak about today?
Trump	1	We have a majority that's essentially, Rand, not a majority.
Trump	1	Matt will always be voting for us.
Trump	1	Together we will ensure that Florida comes back stronger than ever, already happening.
Trump	1	And Alex Acosta, as you know, Secretary of Labor.
Trump	1	We will push onward with new medical frontiers.
Trump	1	It's driving them crazy, they're, loco, it's driving them crazy.
Trump	1	You're going to get big ratings on your show, I'll tell you that.
Trump	1	We had to take it.
Trump	1	California, they want to give you free education, free health care, open borders.
Trump	1	They were not liking what they were seeing.
Trump	1	We can get these great vets to see the doctors.
Trump	1	"We vote no."
Trump	1	If you want to summarize the difference between Democrats and Republicans, just remember this.
Trump	1	Women's unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is only the lowest rate in 65 years.
Trump	1	They're very happy.
Trump	1	I said, "But I'm asking you, King."
Trump	1	Politically speaking, eh.
Trump	1	We have the number one economy on earth.
Trump	1	Just like Neil Gorsuch, who's now on the Supreme Court, has tremendous support.
Trump	1	We're setting records on jobs.
Trump	1	So important.
Trump	1	They said, Would you speak to them.
Trump	1	get it done.
Trump	1	I said, "Really?"
Trump	1	What do I — OK?
Trump	1	This is the first time I'm telling you this, Steve; you weren't looking too sharp.
Trump	1	We don't give up.
Trump	1	Nothing, nothing.
Trump	1	Kevin, come up please.
Trump	1	I don't know what that's all about.
Trump	1	Democrat immigration policies also enable drug smuggling, human trafficking and criminal cartels.
Trump	1	That wasn't my victory.
Trump	1	That was the world's biggest tornado.
Trump	1	Yes, thank you.
Trump	1	After Pearl Harbor, Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle and his raiders flew B-25 bombers off a carrier deck in the deep Pacific in a daring feat of American resolve.
Trump	1	When that bad, you didn't have the right to fire anybody, they could do anything.
Trump	1	I'll -- believe me, him or her, we'll talk them into it.
Trump	1	North Carolina, congratulations.
Trump	1	Get out!
Trump	1	We have cut a record number of regulations.
Trump	1	You know what they're saying?
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	But, sir, I can do a really -- I said, I know you can, but it's not going to play well.
Trump	1	I sent the United States military to our borders.
Trump	1	Seriously.
Trump	1	What do you have to lose?
Trump	1	Every debate, I was right in the middle.
Trump	1	We make the greatest missiles.
Trump	1	And even the Democrats are saying, wow, what a good deal that is.
Trump	1	We have other things.
Trump	1	We are 1 for 1.
Trump	1	He was great during the hearings.
Trump	1	That was the last time -- and boy, we came, like, this close.
Trump	1	They have their capital.
Trump	1	One of them was Herman Zeitchick.
Trump	1	The last thing I asked.
Trump	1	But if crying Chuck Schumer, you know crying Schumer.
Trump	1	Thank you, Henry.
Trump	1	They say it's as bad as a military war-zone hospital.
Trump	1	This was the equivalent or greater.
Trump	1	Do you agree?
Trump	1	I can't go and campaign for all of the people in the House.
Trump	1	You don't want to do it.
Trump	1	We had our little squabbles, minor squabbles, but we've come together, he's a terrific person actually, Senator Marco Rubio.
Trump	1	Where is he?
Trump	1	How about you?
Trump	1	How much is that system?
Trump	1	We don't get paid very much for this, do we?
Trump	1	And this is the time...
Trump	1	Thank you very much, everybody.
Trump	1	They don't give us -- and we take them in, "Congratulations."
Trump	1	My mother would say, oh eight hours.
Trump	1	They do it.
Trump	1	And we just announced that we are putting in place the biggest sanctions that we've ever placed on any country.
Trump	1	Famous phrase.
Trump	1	That's how they funded themselves.
Trump	1	Without a border, you don't have a country.
Trump	1	The House just passed the bill, but Democrats in the Senate are doing everything within their power to block it, although some are actually on our side.
Trump	1	We will never surrender, and we will always fight on to victory, always.
Trump	1	I think you're going to see that coming down at numbers that are pretty unbelievable.
Trump	1	We believe that children should be taught to love our country, to honor our history, to be proud, to be happy, to love and always to respect our great American flag.
Trump	1	I'm glad I -- I'm glad I -- what's going on with this weather today here?
Trump	1	He will be impeached.
Trump	1	November.
Trump	1	He helped us so much with the tax cuts, with regulation cuts, with so many things that we've passed that nobody thought would be possible, would be possible.
Trump	1	Now, they get them really fast.
Trump	1	I said, why is Germany paying billions of dollars a month for energy in a pipeline that goes to Russia?
Trump	1	He's a champ.
Trump	1	They'll be endorsing me.
Trump	1	Congressman?
Trump	1	Oh Madam Secretary.
Trump	1	They can't do it.
Trump	1	They never weeped in their life.
Trump	1	Can you believe it?
Trump	1	But she's their star.
Trump	1	I was happily building buildings in Manhattan, having a good time, having a nice, simple life.
Trump	1	We were delinquent.
Trump	1	They're no good.
Trump	1	These were very rich people.
Trump	1	Now we're allowed to use that pipeline when somebody's very sick, terminally ill, seriously ill.
Trump	1	We're winning now much bigger than I ever thought at a much earlier level.
Trump	1	When they're charging us 200 and 250 and 300%, and we charge them nothing, it's OK to charge them something.
Trump	1	Where are you, Governor?
Trump	1	I want absolutely immaculate air and crystal, clean water.
Trump	1	I said no, no.
Trump	1	When we vet a single federal judge, it goes through a big process.
Trump	1	One of the great businessmen of the world, also -- those two.
Trump	1	They're very brave.
Trump	1	It's not like any other way.
Trump	1	We need you to vote for a Republican House and a Republican Senate so we can continue this incredible movement, the greatest movement in political history, the greatest movement our country has ever seen.
Trump	1	So we're taking them out by the thousands.
Trump	1	It's the best it's ever done.
Trump	1	We've taken a lot, folks.
Trump	1	Marsha Blackburn's great.
Trump	1	Wow.
Trump	1	It's set back from the standpoint of terrorism.
Trump	1	 Shabbat, Shalom.
Trump	1	And the person they think will come back to court.
Trump	1	But I said, "Wait, they have the worst crime rate.
Trump	1	His innovation saved countless millions of lives around the world from starvation.
Trump	1	He is a great guy.
Trump	1	Senator Cornyn, did you leak?
Trump	1	As one nation, and that forge deep and lasting friendship with the people of Israel, we honor our history.
Trump	1	So they're all pouring in, or trying to.
Trump	1	And I can tell you, I'm meeting constantly with foreign leaders, and they walk in, and they say, Mr. President, it's incredible what's happened with your country in such a short period of time.
Trump	1	Thank you for taking -- Doctor, thank you for such a good job.
Trump	1	Drug prices are coming down like they've never seen.
Trump	1	We want strong borders and we want no crime.
Trump	1	To keep America safe, we are rebuilding America's Mighty Mite.
Trump	1	Where is the great Mark Meadows?
Trump	1	And I say to myself, I don't want to tell them they should probably change their name.
Trump	1	[Audience chants Build that wall] The right to vote.
Trump	1	Jeff is a great guy who's doing a really incredible job and thank you, Jeff.
Trump	1	These are incredible people, and our hearts break for every American who has suffered the horrors of these school shootings.
Trump	1	Their plan is called Medicare for All, except they have no money.
Trump	1	We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and last year, for the first time in 51 years, drug prices went down, first time in 51 years, but we're going to bring in a way down.
Trump	1	More than one-third of the steel jobs vanished.
Trump	1	Those horrible hearings, where they were so nasty and horrible, to a great gentleman who's going to go down as one of our greatest Supreme Court justices ever?
Trump	1	It's time.
Trump	1	I'm in Florida a lot.
Trump	1	We don't even know what's in it.
Trump	1	I mean, look at this.
Trump	1	Explain that one to me.
Trump	1	They didn't say that.
Trump	1	And Ted is leading the Congress in Congress for more tax cuts.
Trump	1	I don't know if you even know that.
Trump	1	That's great.
Trump	1	We dug out the Panama Canal.
Trump	1	When you have sanctuary cities, you have crime.
Trump	1	Please stand, Timothy.
Trump	1	Repeal and replace."
Trump	1	And I thanked Pfizer, and I thanked Novartis, and I thanked all the other companies that did.
Trump	1	Thank you very much General.
Trump	1	It's a rough time of this world.
Trump	1	Oh, we're going to do this; we're going to do that.
Trump	1	Does everyone know why?
Trump	1	You don't have to pay for anything.
Trump	1	It's true.
Trump	1	Eric's wife, Lara, who is so great.
Trump	1	Americans that need help, not illegal aliens.
Trump	1	Not all of them.
Trump	1	What the hell do they know?
Trump	1	And it's beautiful.
Trump	1	We were all right.
Trump	1	ICE.
Trump	1	And over the next three months, companies are expected to hire workers at the fastest pace in more than a decade, with the greatest gains for workers right here in the Midwest.
Trump	1	And the beautiful thing is, if we have a national emergency, if we have a problem, big problem, there's nothing like coal.
Trump	1	And they were right: 306.
Trump	1	And it's incredible what happened to those industries.
Trump	1	We're all Americans.
Trump	1	People that have a problem are going to be helped by the Republican Party from -- from the time I got elected, really.
Trump	1	The Congress [Inaudible], right?
Trump	1	With North Korea, they said, "He was too tough.
Trump	1	We pay them a lot.
Trump	1	We're winning.
Trump	1	Republicans produce jobs.
Trump	1	But their whole agenda, they know we want the wall.
Trump	1	We have also taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs, Secretary Azar.
Trump	1	He does.
Trump	1	We thank you.
Trump	1	And that's in two years.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much, everybody.
Trump	1	And Mitch McConnell, how good, how good?
Trump	1	Lowest in 65 years.
Trump	1	You know, you always have somebody.
Trump	1	"Let's build one up to Europe.
Trump	1	Not anymore.
Trump	1	And by the way, by the way, are you ready for this?
Trump	1	Loyal citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you -- the American people like we said we were going to do.
Trump	1	You know, we went through the entire room and the last gentlemen, a prime minister, said, "You know, we're all saying how wonderful everything is, but I don't think the president of the United States is happy.
Trump	1	What a job you're doing.
Trump	1	We love you.
Trump	1	We are taking care of our veterans.
Trump	1	Some are jogging.
Trump	1	You want to know the truth?
Trump	1	To all of our active-duty service members and our wonderful veterans, thank you for serving your country -- with such tremendous distinction and honor.
Trump	1	They're like fools.
Trump	1	And actually, we're going to save a lot of money, but they're going to be taken care of.
Trump	1	And yet she made the most horrible charges against a number one in his class at Yale, perfect human being, great father, great husband.
Trump	1	And that's what they want to do.
Trump	1	We're defending our Second Amendment, protecting religious liberty, taking care of our great veterans... and rebuilding America's military like it hasn't been rebuilt ever before.
Trump	1	Since I took office, ICE agents have arrested over 235,000 aliens with criminal records.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	More -- think of that.
Trump	1	I said, how do you spend $1 billion to build a building?
Trump	1	He just told me that, so I'll take that.
Trump	1	He's much smoother than Schumer actually.
Trump	1	Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.
Trump	1	I don't care.
Trump	1	Ted and Mark, say a few words.
Trump	1	I'm honored to be here today in Kansas City, Missouri, to pay tribute to the men and women who make freedom possible.
Trump	1	But they're not coming in.
Trump	1	And we have just offered a new, affordable health care plan in Missouri that 71 percent less than the horrible Obamacare disaster.
Trump	1	I actually think we have more than they do, who knows?
Trump	1	And now, for the first time in 22 years, wages are rising again.
Trump	1	Thank you, Jeff.
Trump	1	I know you don't care about that.
Trump	1	The United States is the largest producer -- that's happened over the last short period of time -- of crude oil and natural gas in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Trump	1	And see what he wrote himself about women.
Trump	1	We will have a great relationship with China – but it will be a fair relationship, not like it was.
Trump	1	Number two, all you see is women and children.
Trump	1	It was going to be -- now look at it.
Trump	1	America is thriving again, America is winning again and America is being respected again, where respected.
Trump	1	We had it beaten, but one man, I'm sure nobody knows who I'm talking about, voted no, shockingly.
Trump	1	The unemployment rate just hit the lowest level in more than 50 years.
Trump	1	We've also ended the crushing onslaught of federal and other regulation.
Trump	1	The youth unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in over 51 years.
Trump	1	Kelly?
Trump	1	I think I can do it for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars so what I said a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, he said yeah, we have a great site, they were gonna buy a site, we have a great site, the best site.
Trump	1	We want to do legislation.
Trump	1	Republicans want strong borders.
Trump	1	 Thank you.
Trump	1	[Applause] That was some night.
Trump	1	And we have a pipeline but it takes years to get approved.
Trump	1	But they have to live by a certain set of rules.
Trump	1	Here we are, folks.
Trump	1	Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which enters our country through our southern border.
Trump	1	That's even tougher.
Trump	1	And we're also grateful to be joined by somebody who's really worked hard -- his whole life he's worked hard, he gets it.
Trump	1	How did he get elected?
Trump	1	Look at what happened.
Trump	1	For our nation’s veterans, we are improving pain management, with over 43,000 fewer veterans on opioids since January 2017.
Trump	1	I wrote it down, and I put -- I have a stack of papers on my desk in New York.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] And Jon Tester voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities.
Trump	1	But we have conflicts.
Trump	1	That's why.
Trump	1	And you see GDP number's now at 4.2%.
Trump	1	Boy, that kid moved quickly.
Trump	1	They don't ever want to put it on.
Trump	1	They don't like our vets.
Trump	1	And they want five thousand, I said, "Where are you going to find five thousand people to be judges?
Trump	1	That's what he said.
Trump	1	How good?
Trump	1	And I know people, if they have money, they travel all over the world to try and find a cure.
Trump	1	Many years.
Trump	1	Don't kill it because we want to be able to run against it.
Trump	1	But I could name the names.
Trump	1	And today, Justice Kavanaugh took his seat alongside of Justice Gorsuch to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom.
Trump	1	Great guy.
Trump	1	I had a good time in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Trump	1	"Sir, we're paying, because they are our allies?"
Trump	1	It's true.
Trump	1	Somehow we always find a way to win.
Trump	1	Wouldn't you say?
Trump	1	We have been very much taken advantage of as a country.
Trump	1	It's called Narcan.
Trump	1	Did you see that?
Trump	1	I don't want to -- you know, and then everybody forgets.
Trump	1	We have the best location.
Trump	1	It's stopped.
Trump	1	Hey, Ben, I'm going to Illinois after this.
Trump	1	They say he's the Donald Trump of South America.
Trump	1	So this is all -- so far, this is all off cuff.
Trump	1	And the problem is, if I do do that, they won't put the little preamble that we just went through.
Trump	1	Haven't finished the process yet, but it's happening -- choice.
Trump	1	Our Congress will come to a halt.
Trump	1	Thousands.
Trump	1	It costs hundreds of times more money.
Trump	1	We're creating jobs for African-American s, for Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, young Americans, and all Americans.
Trump	1	Oh, he's putting tariffs on he's being nasty.
Trump	1	Bring those American flags, July 4th, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of people, we're going to celebrate America.
Trump	1	The best.
Trump	1	I'm just laying it out.
Trump	1	We save a lot of money because we have vets that go in and they're not badly ill, not badly -- not a big problem.
Trump	1	It's called Right to Try.
Trump	1	Our Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland.
Trump	1	They like you both, Sheldon, it's pretty good.
Trump	1	He said the country needs it.
Trump	1	They even wanted to impeach him on fraudulent charges.
Trump	1	He said four hundred thousand.
Trump	1	She's very strong on our vets.
Trump	1	There's nothing close.
Trump	1	We've already implemented 64 percent of our top agenda items.
Trump	1	And I've had so many people, I was backstage and people are coming up to me, "Mr. President, thank you, sir, for saving our nation," because you understand what that means.
Trump	1	And I will tell you that Rick has been incredible when it comes to law enforcement.
Trump	1	This was Chuck Schumer's special deal for this country.
Trump	1	The person that got -- and for many years, nobody -- no Republican won Pennsylvania.
Trump	1	Very important time when you look at what's happening to Judge Kavanaugh.
Trump	1	It's so easy.
Trump	1	Asian-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest level.
Trump	1	You talk to them and we end up in fights.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	You know that.
Trump	1	Wages are growing, and they are growing at the fastest rate for -- this is something so wonderful -- for blue-collar workers.
Trump	1	And I said, you know, that woman that did such a good job for all of us in Michigan, I think we have to move her to Washington, D.C., to run the Republican National Committee.
Trump	1	And it's going to be a very special time.
Trump	1	That was another one they said you'll never get it done between civil service and unions.
Trump	1	He's making a lot of money.
Trump	1	We've added half a million manufacturing jobs since the election, now that's going to go to 600,000 very shortly.
Trump	1	Thank you, Arizona.
Trump	1	We never left center stage.
Trump	1	I don't know what these people are thinking.
Trump	1	These are great people.
Trump	1	We love you too.
Trump	1	Unbelievable.
Trump	1	People say, "Oh, don't say that, that's not nice."
Trump	1	And then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby.
Trump	1	I even love their national anthem.
Trump	1	They were incredible.
Trump	1	We were so close.
Trump	1	You know, we ran on a theme, "Make America Great Again".
Trump	1	And people are saying, where the hell are all these people?
Trump	1	So I've never seen anything like it.
Trump	1	We doubled, the child-tax credit, and the typical family of four earning $75,000 has seen a tax cut of over $2,000 a year, and that money goes right back into our economy.
Trump	1	Even Supreme Court, we picked two, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch.
Trump	1	I'm not apologizing.
Trump	1	I killed it.
Trump	1	That's an incredible number.
Trump	1	They were proud Americans, and together they turned Indiana into a powerhouse of American people and American ingenuity.
Trump	1	If you have a house and somebody goes to sleep on your lawn, you say, "Sorry, folks, get out of here."
Trump	1	He trains new employees here in Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy.
Trump	1	Then -- then I met with NATO.
Trump	1	Going t be an interesting day at the office.
Trump	1	We have reawakened NASA and that's a good thing.
Trump	1	That I can say.
Trump	1	Crying Chuck -- remember, he was crying.
Trump	1	And I don't know if Dan agrees with me, but what happens is, they kill your steel companies and then they start selling you're steel at much higher prices, you know, it's like a monopoly deal.
Trump	1	Well, maybe they'd give me a pass and they'd say let's not show them, no?
Trump	1	The majority leader, how about this one?
Trump	1	They want to make a deal.
Trump	1	So that didn't work out too well.
Trump	1	It's been more than 10 years.
Trump	1	History.
Trump	1	And don't forget that when you vote.
Trump	1	And he's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt, get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you, OK?
Trump	1	They give you everything they can give you, except like voter ID, and the things that matter.
Trump	1	They go out and they hide out in sanctuary cities.
Trump	1	I said, "Are you crazy?"
Trump	1	I want to show you -- I don't believe there has been any administration in the history of this country that has done more in two years -- and we're not even up to two years yet -- than our administration.
Trump	1	That policeman did a good job.
Trump	1	A seriously low I.Q.
Trump	1	You do know that.
Trump	1	And he gets the first pitch of the game.
Trump	1	58 years, they've been talking.
Trump	1	[Laughter] So, Lou -- you don't Lou, some people.
Trump	1	And it really wasn't.
Trump	1	We didn't.
Trump	1	No energy.
Trump	1	And I'm disappointed by that, because everything else is "historic," "in history."
Trump	1	African-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest rate in the history of our country, and likewise Hispanic-American unemployment lowest in the history of our country.
Trump	1	I don't think you could find the one.
Trump	1	Nineteen major naval vessels, and nearly 8,000 Humvees.
Trump	1	It's all coming back.
Trump	1	How about their whole theme, obstruct, resist.
Trump	1	Last month alone, 10 states hit their lowest unemployment rates in the history of our country.
Trump	1	Now we're going to be using our mines, we're going to be using -- we're opening up -- we're like -- it's the hottest thing that's happening.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	Wages are growing at the fastest pace in nearly a decade.
Trump	1	We were being choked.
Trump	1	And the environmentalists say, oh, isn't it wonderful?
Trump	1	And this was great.
Trump	1	We have taken historic action to bring back American jobs by cracking down on China's abusive trade practices.
Trump	1	 Oh, thank you very much, everybody.
Trump	1	Sixty-five years, 3.6 percent.
Trump	1	Once he started -- once we were on the same page, and we are now always on the same page, he has been as strong and tough and smart as anybody in Washington.
Trump	1	When the enemy attacked U.S. Marines from the shores of Guadalcanal, Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Munro used his own boat to shield his comrades from pounding gunfire.
Trump	1	You like -- do you like -- so I think these people don't want to swing left.
Trump	1	Did you see the bridge yesterday, today?
Trump	1	They make it look -- all of them, as negative as possible.
Trump	1	You know, we have other countries -- we have other countries that, for the same pill for the same company made in the same plant, wherever the hell it's made... [Laughter] You go and you see that same pill, same box, same everything, selling for 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent of what Americans are forced to pay.
Trump	1	You have to do it.
Trump	1	She was -- she enjoyed destroying these local lenders.
Trump	1	I thought of it this morning, Mark.
Trump	1	South Korea's very wealthy.
Trump	1	I said, "He's flawless.
Trump	1	We secured $6 billion, just a while ago, in new funding to fight the opioid epidemic, which is really an epidemic.
Trump	1	We will never surrender.
Trump	1	And I go over here, and I take stack number one, which is literally two or three feet up in the air.
Trump	1	And everything's -- and now I'm getting ready to come to a place called Indiana.
Trump	1	I think statutorily we have to wait a period of time, and then you have to wait again, but it's right on track, doing well.
Trump	1	This guy's out of central casting, I'm telling you.
Trump	1	A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs.
Trump	1	And every day for the next 16 months, we will keep on fighting, we will keep on working and we will keep on winning, we're going to win for you, we're going to win again in 2020, gotta win fo you.
Trump	1	I want somebody great.
Trump	1	[Applause] Good job.
Trump	1	Actually, that's true.
Trump	1	Because we've essentially gutted it anyway and we now have really good stuff coming.
Trump	1	I'm telling you, just fake news.
Trump	1	Wow.
Trump	1	And just today, we announced that we are re-imposing all sanctions lifted under that ridiculous deal that should have never been signed in the first place.
Trump	1	It's what we're fighting for.
Trump	1	You've got to get it -- and vote for these people.
Trump	1	We're also shutting down illegal online marketplaces and preventing drugs that come from China and other countries from bypassing our borders.
Trump	1	 Whoa, whoa.
Trump	1	It's going to happen.
Trump	1	Doing a fantastic job, and he's very respected in Washington.
Trump	1	It's so sad to see.
Trump	1	We're taking care of our vets.
Trump	1	You can't bring back... That was wrong.
Trump	1	And others are -- they are actually studying what we've done.
Trump	1	Republicans should not run away from healthcare.
Trump	1	Very tough act.
Trump	1	We're good at getting things approved.
Trump	1	This is over a long period of time.
Trump	1	They have it made.
Trump	1	We could make it 4 percent."
Trump	1	Can you try to get him up?
Trump	1	We've got 100 degrees out, but you still have thousands of people out there.
Trump	1	We need -- you know, there are some industries, steel and aluminum, we have got to have it.
Trump	1	But we'll get that Supreme Court judge, and that's the big one.
Trump	1	We don't want to hurt people.
Trump	1	Mike.
Trump	1	A vote for the Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities.
Trump	1	Under my administration, we've created 600,000 brand-new manufacturing jobs that people said could never come back to our country.
Trump	1	Not only the car companies.
Trump	1	But I look at it, with Bezos, with Elon Musk, they all love rockets.
Trump	1	We will achieve victory for our magnificent land, the land that we love, because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.
Trump	1	And I got it done.
Trump	1	They crossed the oceans, trekked the deserts, scaled the mountains, created the most incredible republic the world has ever seen.
Trump	1	I said, "Fix it."
Trump	1	Drug companies, a number of months ago, were going to raise their prices.
Trump	1	We never had an empty seat.
Trump	1	I'll just mention it one more time, November 8th, was that a great, great day?
Trump	1	It's like from an advertisement, perfect.
Trump	1	He didn't get any standing ovations."
Trump	1	[Applause] So the Democrats want open borders.
Trump	1	And they were infiltrated with MS-13.
Trump	1	And it's big stuff.
Trump	1	So since Election Day, we've created -- and this is hard to believe because nobody in the news back there, fake news, if I would have said this during the campaign.
Trump	1	And you're in Jerusalem, right?
Trump	1	Your agenda is Make America Great Again.
Trump	1	How stupid can we be?
Trump	1	I don't know if you folks are aware of what's happening.
Trump	1	Now they're coming because of all of the things we've done with regulations, with tax cutting.
Trump	1	And they know we need it.
Trump	1	Other people say get out.
Trump	1	So since the rhetoric stopped --we had very tough rhetoric.
Trump	1	Think about it.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I said -- I said, "You know, we didn't break the 3.
Trump	1	Hi, Steve.
Trump	1	They love it.
Trump	1	He would've been humiliated for what he did.
Trump	1	OK, that makes sense.
Trump	1	He said going up isn't tough.
Trump	1	They game the system; they game it.
Trump	1	Remember that for decades, the United States was the piggy bank that everybody was robbing.
Trump	1	Make America Great Again, MAGA country, right?
Trump	1	I mean, when I have to ask Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters... ... Maxine Waters, can we build a wall, Maxine?
Trump	1	Jim's opponent, Dan Feehan... supports a total government takeover of health care, which drives your costs right through the roof and the health care is lousy, by the way.
Trump	1	And very importantly, you need to go out and vote for Ron DeSantis for governor of Florida.
Trump	1	And right now we are going so fast, we are the fastest developing country in the world.
Trump	1	It's fair.
Trump	1	But I do a show and he's standing out on Hollywood, whatever, Boulevard and he's standing there opening up the door like, "Hello."
Trump	1	We've really produced.
Trump	1	So here's your charts -- going along -- and here's us.
Trump	1	The ocean is in your soul.
Trump	1	Forget about this now."
Trump	1	And he was absolutely fantastic.
Trump	1	Impossible to explain.
Trump	1	It's a disgrace.
Trump	1	But Bernie Sanders was ranting and raving and "We're going to this" and "Trump and Trump and we got to stop" -- what he's going to stop?
Trump	1	She recites poetry.
Trump	1	Third district in West Virginia, Carol Miller, she's done a fantastic job, Carol.
Trump	1	Stand up, please.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	Nothing like winning.
Trump	1	And you know what?
Trump	1	We will never give in.
Trump	1	When Emmanuel began his work, 99 percent of children with leukemia died.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] What a deal.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	I'm so smart.
Trump	1	"Sir, we send it out to the Pacific Ocean."
Trump	1	No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she's ranting and raving like a lunatic.
Trump	1	I'm an environmentalist.
Trump	1	Mike Bost is a warrior.
Trump	1	I'm always looking at the real estate.
Trump	1	You're not riding it over tracks.
Trump	1	That was a good show.
Trump	1	John.
Trump	1	Very haphazardly I just happened to have it with me, so there's your chart, has everyone seen that?
Trump	1	It's not true, it's not true, and then he called them and he said no, it is true.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	We've done that with a lot, right?
Trump	1	Before we begin, I want to send our thoughts and prayers of our entire nation to everyone in the path of Hurricane Michael, especially in the Florida panhandle, where it's hitting and hitting hard.
Trump	1	Just a few hours ago the U.S. Senate confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court, and I proudly signed the judge's commission aboard Air Force One just before landing.
Trump	1	The veterans are all for us.
Trump	1	So don't wait.
Trump	1	Sir, I will check.
Trump	1	And just in the last very short period of time we have added another 6000 vehicle manufacturing and auto parts jobs in Michigan alone and prevented thousands more from being shipped overseas and from going to Mexico.
Trump	1	And they really do, they stoke the fires of resentment and chaos.
Trump	1	Good man.
Trump	1	They're not perfect.
Trump	1	And the fact is, instead of supporting our ICE officers, many of these Democrat politicians who are, really, disciples of a very low IQ person, Maxine Waters -- [Audience Boos] -- and perhaps even worse, Nancy Pelosi -- -- they've launched vicious smears on the brave men and women who defend our communities.
Trump	1	We have unleashed a revolution in American Energy -- the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.
Trump	1	Well, that's one of the great things I got.
Trump	1	America is not being taken advantage of anymore.
Trump	1	$1.1 billion, sir.
Trump	1	Thank you, Montana.
Trump	1	Hundreds of thousands of children born to illegal immigrants are made automatic citizens of the United States every year because of this crazy, lunatic policy that we can end.
Trump	1	And he talked to me backstage.
Trump	1	They're just not.
Trump	1	It'll never happen.
Trump	1	That wasn't supposed to happen.
Trump	1	Have you ever like sit down and talk?
Trump	1	We don't run around like Antifa with their little arms and then go home back home into Mommy's basement... and put on the black uniform and the black helmet.
Trump	1	We got to get your taxes down.
Trump	1	We had 32 plants.
Trump	1	We have to end it.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	The enemy has to know we have that.
Trump	1	You're going to know.
Trump	1	Warren, thank you.
Trump	1	Not thrilled.
Trump	1	But when you win a landslide, they do it -- that's when I kept hearing he could be in trouble in Texas.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	So I'm not happy.
Trump	1	It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right?
Trump	1	[Laughter] They come to see me, Hi, Don.
Trump	1	Donald Trump has won the state of Florida.
Trump	1	Now, they go out, they see a doctor, they take care of themselves, we pay the bill and that's good.
Trump	1	And they say -- and don't forget, the farmers have been going down like this for 20 years; long before I got here.
Trump	1	Somebody said, Well, it won't be.
Trump	1	I go around, How is your drug problem?
Trump	1	We don't need it.
Trump	1	But it's me.
Trump	1	And we are already seeing good results.
Trump	1	Doing a great job for the people of Africa.
Trump	1	Let's fire everybody.
Trump	1	We lost our way.
Trump	1	We have that 1.6 million an hour another 1.6, we needed faster.
Trump	1	We won.
Trump	1	We talked about Ukraine.
Trump	1	And by the way, did you notice we got rid of the individual mandate in Obamacare, right?
Trump	1	We're also joined by Pete Ricketts, Dana Loesch, Charlie Kirk, Diamond and Silk.
Trump	1	I've had it from so many other industries.
Trump	1	[Applause] Wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade, and I've been talking on the campaign trail for so long that wages have been stagnant for 18, 20, and even 21 years.
Trump	1	A national emergency.
Trump	1	And, you know, their whole campaign, you know what they say?
Trump	1	We need Republicans to do it right.
Trump	1	She's going to be voting with Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, the great Maxine Waters.
Trump	1	In America, we trust the people to be wise and to be good.
Trump	1	We got to be tough.
Trump	1	I had to beat him many, many times.
Trump	1	Remember all the phony polls, the states that we were supposed to lose?
Trump	1	But not when it comes to our military.
Trump	1	You remember that.
Trump	1	I heard about it for years."
Trump	1	Are you going to raise taxes?"
Trump	1	Get up early and vote.
Trump	1	That's a big thing.
Trump	1	"Well, let me think about it.
Trump	1	If you're standing in line for 10 days or two weeks or six weeks, you have no idea.
Trump	1	They said, You know, going to the NRA convention and speaking today, that'll be very controversial.
Trump	1	We're getting along great.
Trump	1	I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion.
Trump	1	Isn't that beautiful?
Trump	1	A lot of money in that.
Trump	1	We are going to be building it in many different locations simultaneously with different contractors.
Trump	1	Incredible.
Trump	1	And everybody loves Melania.
Trump	1	No more estate tax.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] And then they said, "You know what?
Trump	1	That's great.
Trump	1	They got to come in through a process.
Trump	1	Could you get it done immediately?"
Trump	1	So I want to thank all of our South Carolina GOP leaders in attendance.
Trump	1	And you know, I don't know if you know it, and I said to them as a room, I said, "Look, I'm all for NATO.
Trump	1	So, if a person comes into our country, steps one foot, they take their name, they bring them to court, they then release them, they go into the country, you never see them again.
Trump	1	And I opened China to our beef a year ago.
Trump	1	Is he here?
Trump	1	[Applause] Instead of punishing entrepreneurship, we are now promoting entrepreneurship.
Trump	1	A minute we're gonna spend a billion dollars, building a essentially a one-story building.
Trump	1	I don't care.
Trump	1	Our steel towns became ghost towns.
Trump	1	How guilty is she?
Trump	1	And a very nice guy named John King for CNN, you know, he has the board, the red board, and his hand is like starting to shake... ... because that board had so much red on it, they've never seen anything like it.
Trump	1	Maybe that's why they said we don't need any steel anymore.
Trump	1	Very important.
Trump	1	Who's here I think?
Trump	1	Thank you, Cindy.
Trump	1	I don't know.
Trump	1	And sometimes I have to do it.
Trump	1	They're fake news.
Trump	1	Explain that.
Trump	1	California has just increased in size to 500 million people.
Trump	1	Boom.
Trump	1	And you know, the following afternoon, I got a callback.
Trump	1	It can be them next.
Trump	1	And, you know, I just approved a lot of pipelines going through Texas and other places, including, as you know, the Keystone XL pipeline I approved.
Trump	1	 Hello, Johnson City.
Trump	1	Was that a man or a woman?
Trump	1	And let's say we have a Republican House.
Trump	1	So, they sold the site for like, I think -- and I'll check the numbers because they'll say, oh, you misrepresented, but these numbers are close enough.
Trump	1	Out of the blue, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.
Trump	1	I want them to approve the wall.
Trump	1	And now they're going to do a lot more.
Trump	1	So we have it.
Trump	1	With your help, on November 3rd 2020 Republicans are going to win the House, we are going to win the Senate, and we are going to, again, win the White House.
Trump	1	If you want a government that cares about you, vote Republican.
Trump	1	Yes, don't look in that one, he got clipped.
Trump	1	They love what we're accomplishing.
Trump	1	In fact, the first time -- that's about the first protester I've seen in a long time.
Trump	1	I said, "What's going on?
Trump	1	They're all opening up their steel mills.
Trump	1	What do you think, Jeff?
Trump	1	And somebody asked me, it's really amazing they never covered this, because if they do, they would have said this is terrible.
Trump	1	Lindsey, say a few words.
Trump	1	But, see, we're trying to do catch-and-hold.
Trump	1	We're honored to be joined today by your next governor, Adam Laxalt.
Trump	1	And the Republican party will always stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.
Trump	1	Don't tell me.
Trump	1	Nobody does it, they acid wash those emails, never to be seen again, but we may find them somewhere deep in the State Department.
Trump	1	That was called a very momentary breach.
Trump	1	Worst of all, a vote for Dan Feehan and Angie Craig is a vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House.
Trump	1	We have to remember.
Trump	1	They'll both make it, and we need them both, badly.
Trump	1	If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes.
Trump	1	[Applause] Every politician was in support, and then they became president, and guess what?
Trump	1	Go ahead.
Trump	1	Sir, would you sign this?
Trump	1	I've let the women down, because women's unemployment -- I've been waiting for months for this thing to change.
Trump	1	Along with a very well-known person, Kansas City Police Chief Rick Smith, for hosting today's event.
Trump	1	The best ever, lowest number ever -- Hispanic American, Asian American.
Trump	1	You need a lot of things.
Trump	1	Hate to say it, but very soon, that's where it's going to be at.
Trump	1	I've been hearing it for years.
Trump	1	They wouldn’t negotiate with previous administrations.
Trump	1	Anyway.
Trump	1	We got $1.6 billion in the last approval.
Trump	1	They're saying, "Yes, sir.
Trump	1	[Applause] That's an amazing statistic.
Trump	1	Very serious.
Trump	1	And then I said, Oh, it's in Europe.
Trump	1	You know that story with Bobby, right?
Trump	1	And he was born -- you talk about central casting -- he was born -- they were saying it 10 years ago about him -- he was born for the U.S. Supreme Court.
Trump	1	And I just said, you just set your all-time record in Mississippi for jobs.
Trump	1	That worked well, right, Rob?
Trump	1	And doesn't make any difference, because they're not coming in.
Trump	1	The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things.
Trump	1	I said, that's job threatening.
Trump	1	He makes his stance in Iowa once every two weeks and then he mentions my name 74 times in one speech.
Trump	1	I shouldn't -- we're a little bit early.
Trump	1	Earl found that many World War Two veterans could not afford to visit their memorial on the National Mall.
Trump	1	It was going to produce 200,000 jobs.
Trump	1	But this is happening all over.
Trump	1	I love that name.
Trump	1	And that was a very sad day for the Republican Party.
Trump	1	You know, you hear these stories about, oh, they don't commit crimes.
Trump	1	And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God.
Trump	1	I don't get it.
Trump	1	And we're supposed to bring them to court, but we have hundreds of thousands of people.
Trump	1	So now they'll have a lot more money to give to their players and their players will still hate me, but that's OK.
Trump	1	If we lost every single vote, we win by a lot.
Trump	1	We are going to have strong borders.
Trump	1	Remember?
Trump	1	That's OK, but you have people that worked on projects almost for their entire life and then they go to a vote and some council and they lose three to two.
Trump	1	But we need 100 percent of the vote.
Trump	1	We could have the greatest economy in the history of our country.
Trump	1	But let's do it right.
Trump	1	[Audience Chants USA] This is a really incredible time for your country.
Trump	1	Your boy.
Trump	1	Do whatever you want.
Trump	1	Way up.
Trump	1	And we have just started.
Trump	1	Dairy.
Trump	1	It's about time.
Trump	1	Two daughters killed so violently by MS-13.
Trump	1	And they were putting all of you people out of work.
Trump	1	And it's our honor to do it -- including funding, by the way -- including funding.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
Trump	1	In the history of our country, they're the best unemployment rates.
Trump	1	I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, and what a difference that made.
Trump	1	It's a whole different ballgame.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	The United States has just surpassed Germany as having the most asylum seekers of any nation on Earth.
Trump	1	We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American way.
Trump	1	And they're sticking -- you got to stick it out.
Trump	1	They've choked.
Trump	1	Over a Democrat.
Trump	1	And some of those people I would love to have, because we need them, but they have to apply.
Trump	1	People were calling me and they say, please don't do it.
Trump	1	Big incentive.
Trump	1	It hits a flame, it goes up.
Trump	1	Republicans are also strongly protecting Medicare.
Trump	1	Yesterday it was announced that unemployment has fallen to 3.7%, the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, lowest in 50 years.
Trump	1	And I think somebody said she's in Nevada right now campaigning with Pocahontas.
Trump	1	They apologized for their bad coverage of me.
Trump	1	Hey, Stanley, how do you like that idea?
Trump	1	They're not elite, you're elite.
Trump	1	It's a great police department, a police force that has lost too many heroes, but has never lost its will to protect, and to serve you.
Trump	1	Oh, did we catch them in the act.
Trump	1	I want to just end by thanking the Susan B. Anthony List.
Trump	1	Thank you, Sean.
Trump	1	We have surrendered, we had.
Trump	1	Their traditions are rich with the salt and blood of three centuries.
Trump	1	He wants to pay for college education and education.
Trump	1	And they're happy, and it's a lot of people that are working.
Trump	1	So we're fighting there.
Trump	1	But that's why I'm here today, that's to ask the people of Wisconsin to re-elect a truly great governor, Scott Walker... and to send an incredible woman and talent, Leah Vukmir... to the United States Senate.
Trump	1	I think we've done more than we've even said.
Trump	1	Some industries, you can.
Trump	1	In fact, some of those guys -- and they don't question it -- will say that I produced more than I promised, which is true.
Trump	1	And we support the men and women of law enforcement.
Trump	1	The Green New Deal.
Trump	1	It's leaving fast.
Trump	1	If you want a leader who shares your values and who will fight for your families, you need to get out and vote for Rick Scott.
Trump	1	That was a very good job.
Trump	1	So nice.
Trump	1	We certainly will by the time of the election, but you look at the numbers, but it's so good.
Trump	1	We are a forest nation, it's very interesting like certain places, Finland, Austria, others, they're a forest nation, they say we take care of our forest.
Trump	1	They're going to do it.
Trump	1	Oh, please let him run.
Trump	1	He bent down, stopped that ball, threw it to first.
Trump	1	Come up, Sean.
Trump	1	Congratulations.
Trump	1	We could do it right now, frankly.
Trump	1	They got back to me they said, Sir, it will cost approximately $7 million to stop.
Trump	1	I'm sorry."
Trump	1	They can't breathe.
Trump	1	Vote early.
Trump	1	He could be up by 12.
Trump	1	True.
Trump	1	That means 1% or less.
Trump	1	Right, fellas?
Trump	1	Would never have happened.
Trump	1	Just think of it, how horrible that was.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Other than these names, who are the important ones?
Trump	1	So, anyway -- so that was dead for a couple of years, and no chance.
Trump	1	I used to hear about now Justice Kavanaugh.
Trump	1	Serious drinking problem.
Trump	1	So I think I have to change it.
Trump	1	Thank you both for bringing the trafficker to a very strong and swift justice.
Trump	1	We want our jobs to be here.
Trump	1	If Democrats get 51 seats, the key Senate committees will be run by the far left Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie.
Trump	1	The number one -- it's -- it's never been worse than it is right now because of the computer, because of the Internet.
Trump	1	Makes it very, very hard.
Trump	1	And it was done, and it was done properly.
Trump	1	He's a rough looking guy.
Trump	1	So I thought of it for a little while, and the press said, are you going to cancel these two events?
Trump	1	But do you see what's going on where areas big areas?
Trump	1	And Godspeed.
Trump	1	Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law abiding citizens not criminal aliens.
Trump	1	Congratulations.
Trump	1	But he was very smart and we have established really a very good relationship.
Trump	1	We can't lose $151 billion with the European Union.
Trump	1	I'm not going to get into what it was, but it was a very bad problem and it went on for years and it was really hurting the NFL.
Trump	1	And it's mostly good, I will tell you.
Trump	1	They would have gone to war.
Trump	1	We knew.
Trump	1	Bring them in through merit.
Trump	1	Nancy Pelosi was caught three weeks ago.
Trump	1	These are people -- you're right, they're heroes.
Trump	1	So we have to wait.
Trump	1	And by the way, we need a steel industry.
Trump	1	That very same week, U.S. Steel announced it was restarting production right here in Granite City, and bringing back far more than the original estimate of 500 jobs.
Trump	1	That's because people want a piece of our action.
Trump	1	When a vicious gang member shot and killed two people in Wilmington last February, investigators used the ATF's ballistic database to match the shell casings to another shooting and bring the killer to justice.
Trump	1	I'm not going to leave you alone.
Trump	1	You're not going to see that anymore.
Trump	1	You're going to elect a Republican House.
Trump	1	You have to see the charts.
Trump	1	I said, "You've got to fix the NFL problem.
Trump	1	But, to keep this momentum going, to continue this incredible progress, to keep on winning, you have to vote Republican in November.
Trump	1	Remember the previous administration?
Trump	1	We have all the cards, but nobody has ever chosen to use those cards.
Trump	1	I'll tell you what, honestly, it's easier than collecting a hundred and thirteen dollars and 57 cents from a tenant in a bad location in New York City and it's safer too.
Trump	1	You know what?
Trump	1	And that's what was happening.
Trump	1	They get taken care of.
Trump	1	I know the true feeling.
Trump	1	And you're going to see a big difference.
Trump	1	They don't love what I've done, and that's OK. And I don't like what they've done either.
Trump	1	What do we have other than death and destruction?
Trump	1	And then they came back.
Trump	1	I had Jim Brown.
Trump	1	I said, what happened to all that beautiful?
Trump	1	He voted against virtually everything that we want, including regulation cuts.
Trump	1	They got home, they said, "I didn't know Trump endorsed him."
Trump	1	 Thank you.
Trump	1	But I want to build it at one time, fast.
Trump	1	People like it.
Trump	1	So we are very close to finishing that one off.
Trump	1	But I saw pictures that there were no people.
Trump	1	And we're doing great back at home.
Trump	1	But the great betrayal of the American middle class ended the day that I took the oath of office because I'm with you, I'm with you.
Trump	1	Where is Harold?
Trump	1	The only ones, actually, that voted against him were all of the people, super-lefts, that are running against me in two and a half years.
Trump	1	Doesn't that sound nice?
Trump	1	And we may reject plenty, but we're going to reject them in a year and they can go on to do something else.
Trump	1	These are great towns, great places, but ICE -- we have to cherish ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.
Trump	1	I spoke with the Senate about it.
Trump	1	I said, I think you've lost them for a long time.
Trump	1	So I just said why.
Trump	1	And now because of what Secretary Azar is doing, you're going to see drug pricing, prescription drugs going down.
Trump	1	People that have really helped me in Washington -- you know, we did a lot of things, including cutting your taxes, the biggest tax decrease ever.
Trump	1	But, boy, I'll tell you what, when he's on your side, there's nobody you want better.
Trump	1	I never see Senator Nelson ever, until six months before the election, and then you don't see anybody else but him.
Trump	1	In other words I needed 270 to win.
Trump	1	Just so sad.
Trump	1	Billions of dollars will come into our Treasury.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] But -- but I'll tell you this.
Trump	1	Do you mind?
Trump	1	That's terrible.
Trump	1	We want real offense and we want real defense.
Trump	1	But you know, as I was flying on Air force One, I said to my people, because of the horrible tragedy -- I mean, I almost shouldn't say this, but people that have done this and do this for a living -- tough living -- people that went in as first responders, police officers, law enforcement, that have seen many crime scenes -- they said this is one of the worst that they've seen.
Trump	1	Thank you, Deborah, very much.
Trump	1	You know, you're looking at a bridge with thousands and thousands.
Trump	1	The crisis on the border -- and it is a crisis, it's crazy.
Trump	1	They're so hard-working.
Trump	1	Thank you, doctor.
Trump	1	We're being so nice.
Trump	1	We're going to build new airports.
Trump	1	That wouldn't be so good, right?
Trump	1	Doing a good job.
Trump	1	As Alex and Shelley remind us, our greatest resource in the fight against drugs is the heart and the might and the soul of the American people.
Trump	1	But we're also providing massive numbers of jobs because we build all of that equipment in the United States.
Trump	1	We get no credit, fake news, we get no credit.
Trump	1	The media.
Trump	1	And that hasn't been done in a long time.
Trump	1	So we have a lot of people.
Trump	1	As a result of all of these taxes and all of these tax cuts, American businesses now are on a level playing field with your competitors from other countries who have so many advantages, including subsidy by governments.
Trump	1	Well, the Soo Locks are going to hell.
Trump	1	Our armies were made of farmers.
Trump	1	But then it was just talk.
Trump	1	No, no, we're gonna have to change this.
Trump	1	And, by the way, I don't know this, but I understand life and I understand politics, I guess -- or I wouldn't be here, in a short period of time.
Trump	1	And David Perdue and Lindsey Graham helped me, a lot of people helped us.
Trump	1	Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors, who have earned it and they've paid for it.
Trump	1	Our country is respected again.
Trump	1	I wish the media would show this crowd.
Trump	1	Our military was depleted.
Trump	1	You got to be with the contractors.
Trump	1	Not just through luck or happenstance.
Trump	1	This goes on, and on and on.
Trump	1	That's right.
Trump	1	Give them whatever they want.
Trump	1	[Applause] Your great state was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their incredible families.
Trump	1	I'm just looking -- and then the media -- the fake news -- they'll say, He got no standing ovations.
Trump	1	That was a Hillary Clinton special.
Trump	1	Terrible.
Trump	1	We fight so hard.
Trump	1	But we're all prepared, and hopefully it won't be as bad as it's looking.
Trump	1	Normandy.
Trump	1	People understand it.
Trump	1	Congress and Congress alone can solve the problem.
Trump	1	She has been so great.
Trump	1	So, the premiums in Minnesota this year are coming down by double digits.
Trump	1	We can do other things later.
Trump	1	I don't think that works too well.
Trump	1	But Liz Cheney was so dedicated and -- and the loyalty.
Trump	1	The economy is so good.
Trump	1	And this has been... [Audience Chants USA] So this has been a really historic week for America.
Trump	1	I've got a tremendous percentage of law enforcement vote, but you know, I think, I might have -- Do I get 100%.
Trump	1	Tomorrow, the people of Missouri are going to elect a truly outstanding new senator.
Trump	1	And he was talking... Go ahead.
Trump	1	Should we bring him up?
Trump	1	Remember that I've only been doing it for a couple of years, right?
Trump	1	It is possibly the greatest political movement anywhere.
Trump	1	Vote for me, African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-America unemployment have all reached the lowest levels ever recorded in our history, right?
Trump	1	No, no, we have more potential than any other country.
Trump	1	Can't be complacent.
Trump	1	If you look at the plans, we're coming out with a great -- and we got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare.
Trump	1	Great job.
Trump	1	They want to raise your taxes.
Trump	1	These are incredible people, we can take it.
Trump	1	We stand on the shoulders of these American patriots who knew how to work, knew how to fight and knew how to win.
Trump	1	Vote.
Trump	1	You know it well -- following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance, pushed by us, into the WTO, World Trade Organization, perhaps the only deal worse than NAFTA.
Trump	1	And you do.
Trump	1	I have a great relationship with President Xi of China, and I think we have a real good chance of working something out that's a great deal for us and works for everybody.
Trump	1	We had an incredible thing.
Trump	1	They're not looking anymore for the Mediterranean.
Trump	1	And he said, "Sir, I want to thank you.
Trump	1	I don't care."
Trump	1	Nobody.
Trump	1	They're out.
Trump	1	That was a big, big problem.
Trump	1	Congressman Drew Ferguson.
Trump	1	You hear it.
Trump	1	We approve that, and that's a big thing.
Trump	1	And women unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is soon to be changed to historic levels, but right now, I'm sorry, it's the lowest in 65 years, OK?
Trump	1	And African American income has reached an all-time high.
Trump	1	Many people that you don t want in our country.
Trump	1	They said, "Well, we really don't want to meet."
Trump	1	We have the folks here that are responsible for doing that.
Trump	1	Where's Virginia?
Trump	1	So they put them in, and they have them, and they let them go, and it drives you people a little bit crazy, doesn't it, huh?
Trump	1	John Cornyn.
Trump	1	Look what they've done today.
Trump	1	Thank you, Hal.
Trump	1	We can do it.
Trump	1	And you know what else they're doing?
Trump	1	As part of this tremendous victory for American farmers, Canada agreed to remove their massive trade barriers to the American dairy industry.
Trump	1	I have to tell you this about Sean.
Trump	1	Confirm your great judicial nominees and save our courts with incredible pro-Constitution judges.
Trump	1	These are bad people -- in Boston, Massachusetts, which is a place where you have sanctuary cities.
Trump	1	We did.
Trump	1	This is before the election.
Trump	1	Forget taxes, with so many things, more important than taxes, although those big tax cuts, they did come in handy, didn't they?
Trump	1	Unfortunately, she was right, but it was created in South Korea, not in our country.
Trump	1	Where's Dan?
Trump	1	I have to be honest with you.
Trump	1	First time in my life ever, I think it's the first time, I said, David, that's too little.
Trump	1	I said, "you know what?
Trump	1	Can you even believe it what's going on there?
Trump	1	They will live forever.
Trump	1	I'd say he's a terrible person.
Trump	1	And you know, for those who think, oh that should be easy.
Trump	1	We want Cindy tomorrow.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	By the way, look back there, look at all that media.
Trump	1	I'll tell my staff, great going, fellas.
Trump	1	It's all coming back.
Trump	1	He's tough.
Trump	1	You need very badly.
Trump	1	We need steel plants.
Trump	1	It's bigger now because of the computer because of the Internet than ever before worldwide, not just here, worldwide and most come through our southern border where we don't have a wall, they don't go through ports of entry.
Trump	1	That unleash violent predators like MS-13 into American communities, leaving innocent Americans at the mercy of really, by the way, really ruthless animals, really ruthless animals Nancy Pelosi said, "How dare he call a human being an animal?"
Trump	1	But now wages are rising.
Trump	1	That hat is fantastic.
Trump	1	So we open the embassy next week.
Trump	1	 Madam President, Mr. Secretary-General, world leaders, ambassadors, and distinguished delegates: One year ago, I stood before you for the first time in this grand hall.
Trump	1	They retired because they had like very little support.
Trump	1	That was brutal.
Trump	1	He wants to have open borders and everybody worldwide can pour into California, just pour in.
Trump	1	We're doing a great job.
Trump	1	That's like -- did anyone ever hear of 42 points -- and we're going to better this time, OK?
Trump	1	And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force.
Trump	1	And we really have to get out.
Trump	1	We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never, ever, ever back down.
Trump	1	Because, honestly, we're treating everybody good.
Trump	1	I heard he was on.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	But they were telling, you know, giving me advice, a lot of them, oh, just so bad, so pathetic.
Trump	1	In August of 1790, by request of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, Congress established a fleet of ten swift vessels to defend our shores.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	So here's the thing -- then they said, wait a minute.
Trump	1	The TPP would have decimated U.S. manufacturing and gutted America's auto industry, would have gutted the industry and they were dying to do this crazy deal.
Trump	1	It's been going on for many, many decades and many years.
Trump	1	You had to live with these people.
Trump	1	But in my case, it can't, because it's true.
Trump	1	She was vicious and they hit her.
Trump	1	He said it was a tough thing, it was a tough time for them.
Trump	1	Nothing happens -- very few, very little happens by accident.
Trump	1	And I am profoundly thankful to my family.
Trump	1	And you know what we have for it?
Trump	1	Works with us so hard on all of the tax cuts and the regulation cuts, and all of the things we do, your great Senator John Hoeven.
Trump	1	I would have said let's get some nets and let's wait until she comes down.
Trump	1	And we are working now on a military plan that's got to be something very special.
Trump	1	Thanks to our America First -- does everybody like American First?
Trump	1	And if you see what I did yesterday with NASA, right?
Trump	1	They know it's the right thing.
Trump	1	Well, by then it will be another year and two years and three years and you'll be insisting, Governor DeSantis, please see our president, it's too much winning.
Trump	1	How many times have you heard that?
Trump	1	I ended that one too.
Trump	1	And, you know, one thing I have to say, also, Obamacare was going up 115 percent, 125 percent, 80 percent, 60 percent, 53 percent, all different places.
Trump	1	They'll destroy what we're building and what we're going to build.
Trump	1	Heidi was also against us from the very beginning of the travel ban, a common-sense policy to improve our vetting and our national security.
Trump	1	We lose $100 billion a year, and that doesn't include the billions of dollars of drugs that flow into our country.
Trump	1	It doesn't matter.
Trump	1	Pete Sessions is a fantastic congressman.
Trump	1	 Thank you, Indiana.
Trump	1	You have the power with your vote to defend your family, defend your country, defend your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity.
Trump	1	I said, how am I doing in Indiana?
Trump	1	They are coming back fast.
Trump	1	They were rough, they wouldn't have hit them in prime time by the way, not in prime time.
Trump	1	[Applause] And, you know, in terms of value or worth, we've created $7 trillion worth of value for our country.
Trump	1	$7 trillion.
Trump	1	I want to bring our people back home.
Trump	1	It's been a very important place.
Trump	1	You have a lot of veterans in Montana.
Trump	1	But we'll reducing drug prices very soon.
Trump	1	I'm good at getting it done.Now we also passed, this is 45 years, the VA accountability law to insure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable, you are fired, get out.
Trump	1	But I gave a totally off-the-record -- you saw it -- it said, "off the record."
Trump	1	Got their approvals recently -- the road is no longer a straight shot.
Trump	1	[Applause] Make America great again.
Trump	1	And I mentioned words -- I won't even mention them tonight because there's a lot of young people here, but I mentioned words and everybody thought it was wonderful.
Trump	1	Is it still open?
Trump	1	How did he get elected?
Trump	1	They're still crying.
Trump	1	But this was a barrier.
Trump	1	Most importantly, I want to thank all of you, the proud, card-carrying members of the NRA.
Trump	1	I mean that, too.
Trump	1	You think this is fun?
Trump	1	He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave.
Trump	1	We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, and I see what they're doing.
Trump	1	Just said it.
Trump	1	How can that happen?
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	We got our money to help us out with the opioid crisis, $6 billion.
Trump	1	So when I came here originally, West Virginia, frankly, was down and out.
Trump	1	They came in through the wonderful Obama administration.
Trump	1	They're coming up for many other reasons and sometimes for that reason.
Trump	1	You worked and worked.
Trump	1	We have to have Democrat support because we need to go not just a majority, unfortunately, which we could get.
Trump	1	But I came up with this expression -- it's called, Drain the swamp, right?
Trump	1	"Jim Smith said that Donald Trump is a bad guy."
Trump	1	Thank you, all.
Trump	1	They always talk.
Trump	1	We have created since my election 5.5 million new jobs.
Trump	1	I love that business.
Trump	1	Today, I stand before you, as the President of the United States, to tell you that my administration will always honor, cherish, and support the men and women in blue.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	 Hello, Wisconsin.
Trump	1	They don't understand high test scores at, you know, the -- you can have the highest SATs ever recorded and that would not impress MS-13.
Trump	1	Instead of apologizing for America we're standing up for America.
Trump	1	You heard the way he talked.
Trump	1	Look at the size of that guy.
Trump	1	Very important.
Trump	1	Great job, Jeff.
Trump	1	They had me stomping around screaming with anger up in my area of the White House where I live with my wife and son, Barron.
Trump	1	And as long as you keep this team in place, we have a tremendous way to go.
Trump	1	A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream, frankly, the destruction of our country.
Trump	1	It has been an incredible year for our country and for the Republican Party.
Trump	1	And we're doing federal legislation, but all over the country.
Trump	1	He said the single biggest problem this country has is North Korea.
Trump	1	We will pass Kate's law.
Trump	1	We believe no American should be left behind.
Trump	1	So instead of spending $1.2 billion, we spent $400,000.
Trump	1	We have taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs.
Trump	1	These beautiful Republican congressmen and women.
Trump	1	African-American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded.
Trump	1	This is big stuff.
Trump	1	And then I look and I say, "You know, it's probably a good thing because they're saying, 'Man, I don't know where these people are coming from.'"
Trump	1	We got more brains.
Trump	1	Everyone says, but will he get the women?
Trump	1	Democrats want to abolish ICE and they want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and MS-13 thugs.
Trump	1	And I came up with an idea that I thought was brilliant.
Trump	1	Thank you, Cindy.
Trump	1	But Democrats, they want open borders, and they don't mind crime.
Trump	1	The whole thing is a scam.
Trump	1	Service to our nation, and to the cause of liberty.
Trump	1	We could knock that wall out in one year if they gave us the funds.
Trump	1	Look, watch.
Trump	1	A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation and more products made right here in the good old USA.
Trump	1	And obviously, defense is number one, but you know what else it is?
Trump	1	I'd like to now welcome up Jerry Howard, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders.
Trump	1	Most of them do.
Trump	1	That’s not bad.
Trump	1	You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything.
Trump	1	True.
Trump	1	If we're not going to find Elvis.
Trump	1	The money is coming immediately.
Trump	1	We got them in the lottery.
Trump	1	With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.
Trump	1	Jon Tester voted no on tax cuts.
Trump	1	And we will always fight on to victory, victory, victory.
Trump	1	Their policies let gangs -- some of the most of vicious gangs in the world pour into our country.
Trump	1	Democrats believe American taxpayers should provide free welfare to illegals.
Trump	1	 Our country is respected again, remember that.
Trump	1	If I say spin the cameras, they'll never spin the cameras.
Trump	1	Been a long time.
Trump	1	These are tough people.
Trump	1	But I'm sorry.
Trump	1	Hopefully they're going to get smart.
Trump	1	Norman had many setbacks in life but he never, ever gave up.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	They couldn't fire the people.
Trump	1	Foxconn, they make a lot of the Apple products.
Trump	1	Women unemployment, it's only 65 years.
Trump	1	No, we have to have it.
Trump	1	"Oh, I didn't know."
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	You've got to get out and vote.
Trump	1	I don't think we're complacent.
Trump	1	Which is true.
Trump	1	I never even heard of an F. I never heard.
Trump	1	Who would even think this goes on?
Trump	1	The women love them.
Trump	1	It's amazing the way it's worked out.
Trump	1	I said but I'm going to bring back your auto business.
Trump	1	He's an alcoholic.
Trump	1	You murdered."
Trump	1	Why has he fallen like a rock?
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	They don't want to get up in the morning.
Trump	1	Let the other people take of it now.
Trump	1	Remember?
Trump	1	You know that.
Trump	1	You're incredible people.
Trump	1	They send millions of cars -- Mercedes, all of them, BMW.
Trump	1	Those lights bright enough?
Trump	1	Charter Steel announced a new $150 million dollar steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights.
Trump	1	Because, if you think -- I mean, this is the United States.
Trump	1	It really is amazing.
Trump	1	On issue after issue, House Democrats are way outside of the American mainstream.
Trump	1	And they tell these people exactly what to say.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	In every endeavor, the class of 2018 has shown its metal and it's proved its might.
Trump	1	Now, let's hear from Dawn Wallace.
Trump	1	But if Democrats take control, they will try to plunge our country into gridlock poverty and chaos, and that's what's going to happen, it can change.
Trump	1	It really is great, great history.
Trump	1	He was terrific.
Trump	1	We have the European Union -- they don't treat us right.
Trump	1	Kanye, he has his ideas.
Trump	1	Justice Anthony Kennedy, a very special guy, also just announced a little while ago his retirement from the United States Supreme Court.
Trump	1	I love this business.
Trump	1	This great state, the state of Tennessee, was forged through the sweat and sacrifice of tough pioneer men and women, tough people, good genes you have, good genes.
Trump	1	Some people said it was a great speech.
Trump	1	 Thank you to our First Lady, Melania, who has been so incredible.
Trump	1	So great.
Trump	1	And we will pay the bill, and it will be much less expensive, and you'll be all set, right?"
Trump	1	It's easy.
Trump	1	We're protecting Europe.
Trump	1	And Bernie -- you know, Bernie is crazy.
Trump	1	I mean, excuse the crime figures because the crime figures in the United States are doing well.
Trump	1	You know, I think that blue wave is being rapidly shattered.
Trump	1	Did you leak- Remember her answer?
Trump	1	I would do it, except for these people up there.
Trump	1	We will never give up.
Trump	1	He's headed over to North Korea.
Trump	1	It was sweat.
Trump	1	They've done just a great job.
Trump	1	We're bringing down the price of prescription drugs.
Trump	1	We love our miners.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much, Iowa.
Trump	1	We secured a record 700 -- listen to this.
Trump	1	I had Donald.
Trump	1	 So this is supposed to be a Democrat state.
Trump	1	They could be doing anything.
Trump	1	That's for a million bucks in a hundred dollar bills, right.
Trump	1	The big deal.
Trump	1	He said nobody's ever asked him.
Trump	1	Did nothing, no collusion.
Trump	1	Get out and vote, please, OK?
Trump	1	They love her.
Trump	1	And by the way, in all fairness, you also find out whether or not it works.
Trump	1	Ellison is the number two official in the entire Democrat Party and he recently marched in a parade wearing a shirt that read, "I do not believe in borders."
Trump	1	Now that may change, there's some bad things going on out there that should have been stopped long before this administration and maybe long before the previous administration.
Trump	1	In many cases, daughters, and in many cases, sons, but what they do to these incredible kids, walking home from school, going home with books to study and do homework and they intercept them and they're -- they're horrible, it's horrible and we're getting them out.
Trump	1	Gary.
Trump	1	To keep America safe from terrorism, we have put in place the travel ban.
Trump	1	And I said, Brett, congratulations, I've chosen you, and I have a list of 23 people or so that are phenomenal, top students, top everything, top judges.
Trump	1	We stop about $500 billion worth of drugs from pouring into our country.
Trump	1	And West Virginia's very happy, and that coal is coming back and our miners are working again, folks.
Trump	1	We can't get that word out.
Trump	1	This is a big site, big setbacks.
Trump	1	He is -- thanks, Jim.
Trump	1	They cannot get enough.
Trump	1	Would you say 100 percent?
Trump	1	He wants to take away your ethanol.
Trump	1	I want to just say that tomorrow's so important.
Trump	1	We protect them, and they don't pay us for the protection, or they pay us a small fraction.
Trump	1	It's not rational.
Trump	1	Global freeloading in which drug companies charge higher prices for Americans to subsidize lower prices for countries throughout the rest of the world.
Trump	1	So we reached the lowest level in 65 years and in a very short period of time that will be a historic level, too, like the others.
Trump	1	Let's not rock the boat.
Trump	1	And that's what they will do.
Trump	1	It said made in the USA.
Trump	1	You know, it's interesting, when we first started, there were a lot of people who were showing up.
Trump	1	I tell you what -- really, I think it should be a red wave.
Trump	1	But it's worth it.
Trump	1	All of that money that we've secured for our military, all of that I've directed the Pentagon to begin a process of creating a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces called the Space Force.
Trump	1	What we did was a miracle.
Trump	1	They're starting to go up.
Trump	1	They didn't how the hell to win.
Trump	1	And that goes for Border Patrol, that goes for ICE.
Trump	1	And he said, she won't debate me.
Trump	1	I said to a certain general, good guy, but, you know, he's not into business.
Trump	1	They'll take away your healthcare and they'll make it impossible.
Trump	1	I love the smell of a construction site, right?
Trump	1	Thank you, Texas.
Trump	1	It's such a big thing.
Trump	1	Don't put it.
Trump	1	and Iran is not the same country right now, folks.
Trump	1	 My fellow Americans.
Trump	1	They smiled, they laughed.
Trump	1	He walked the streets of Flushing for -- where I grew up.
Trump	1	We are a nation of builders, makers and creators in the furnaces of our factories.
Trump	1	Huh?
Trump	1	Anyway, I called up Bobby Knight, ding, ding, ding.
Trump	1	The people of Ohio have known you a long time.
Trump	1	We're starting a big, brand-new section.
Trump	1	Those days are over.
Trump	1	Appreciate it.
Trump	1	They're all coming to see us.
Trump	1	Okay?
Trump	1	And they would ride the crest.
Trump	1	They're coming in.
Trump	1	And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there.
Trump	1	And we have a very good relationship with President Xi.
Trump	1	Nobody says that.
Trump	1	We haven't touched your Social Security, right?
Trump	1	We had 32,000 people.
Trump	1	And then he sat down and a lot of bad things started being said.
Trump	1	We got the governor of Ohio, and he's great.
Trump	1	It's not strong, it's opposition but not strong.
Trump	1	Would it be possible to get back the remains of family members that died in the Korean War?"
Trump	1	Can you imagine?
Trump	1	[Applause] True.
Trump	1	And -- and we have the best first responders, military, law enforcement, and FEMA, the best in the world, and they're ready.
Trump	1	Kevin's a big fan of the wall, and I just say this.
Trump	1	And a cotton farmer was standing in line -- there must have been 40 farmers, all of them really badly hurt.
Trump	1	And we did great.
Trump	1	You weren't sure that Trump was going to win, but you all went out there.
Trump	1	But if Chuck Schumer -- cryin' Chuck -- and Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary Maxine Waters... take power, they will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress.
Trump	1	And I said on the plane that, number one, I'm going to see these young, brilliant, handsome, and beautiful -- you know you're not allowed to say that anymore but I'm saying it anyway.
Trump	1	And he made statements that, "Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country.
Trump	1	The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet.
Trump	1	They are so happy.
Trump	1	You're great people.
Trump	1	But they hadn't hit these numbers in 16 years.
Trump	1	[Applause] And we have so many other officials.
Trump	1	How stupid is this?
Trump	1	No, it's -- it is.
Trump	1	That means you're all in trouble.
Trump	1	But it's good for them.
Trump	1	You've got to do it because, remember, we're going to win this primary but don't take any chances.
Trump	1	I'm bringing the jobs back.
Trump	1	Barack Obama.
Trump	1	I'll give it to Mark Levin.
Trump	1	I appreciate it very much.
Trump	1	And we're restoring our industrial might like nobody can believe.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	They can't say anything else.
Trump	1	Such an important -- if we can find that answer, that's going to be a big -- that's going to solve most of the problem, I suspect.
Trump	1	Tonight, America's heart is with the victims of the horrific synagogue shooting in Poway, California just happened.
Trump	1	Very simple.
Trump	1	Cory Booker.
Trump	1	I'm for us.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Like, 90 percent of the time, you win the presidency and, for whatever reason, you lose the midterm.
Trump	1	Can you believe it?
Trump	1	Good.
Trump	1	But, you know, it's like liberating, like a war, like there's a foreign invasion.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	[Laughter] But that'll never happen.
Trump	1	But the lowest in 21 years.
Trump	1	These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, their sweat, and their tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.
Trump	1	Right.
Trump	1	When the Wisconsin timber industry was threatened, my administration took immediate action.
Trump	1	Catch and release.
Trump	1	Thank you, Bill.
Trump	1	Let us all show our appreciation for a very dear friend and a leader -- a great leader -- Zippy Duval.
Trump	1	You're back in business.
Trump	1	I wish we had Matt representing us in the Senate."
Trump	1	And that's why, in November, we will reverse a trend.
Trump	1	We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
Trump	1	We have them all.
Trump	1	I have known Adam for a long time.
Trump	1	We have a list of companies, they're all -- and you know why?
Trump	1	So we have other leaders in the room, but we all know who they are.
Trump	1	You've had some good ones, haven't you?
Trump	1	Only in the Panhandle.
Trump	1	But in the meantime, they knock the hell out of us on trade and they have been doing it for a long time.
Trump	1	And he didn't want -- he -- he said, "Sir, I'll do whatever your -- your order is."
Trump	1	But I said, look, we're protecting Japan.
Trump	1	This is what happens.
Trump	1	There's nothing you can do to those suckers.
Trump	1	And your senator is one of them.
Trump	1	And his language was so filthy that it made me, like, the most clean-cut human being on earth.
Trump	1	It's -- isn't it incredible, when you talk about a double standard?
Trump	1	Nancy Pelosi and her gang they've got to be voted out of office.
Trump	1	Horrible, oh, did they go after me.
Trump	1	A person comes into our country -- another country throws them out.
Trump	1	I said, "Who was that?"
Trump	1	It will be -- it will be the second greatest vote you ever cast.
Trump	1	Republicans are the party of law and order, and justice.
Trump	1	We got along.
Trump	1	So I got them to pay $100 billion.
Trump	1	Thank you, Paul, for... thank you very much, and those stories are inspiring for everybody in our country, and you have a lot of people listening right now.
Trump	1	And we don't care about momentum when it comes to a disgrace like just happened to our country.
Trump	1	I mean, we have an aircraft carrier and you can't send planes off the damn thing.
Trump	1	That's the way it works, folks.
Trump	1	We worked very hard.
Trump	1	On November 7th, she'll say I was wrong.
Trump	1	That's not a very good one.
Trump	1	And everybody believed them.
Trump	1	And we go away on Monday.
Trump	1	But it's great that when you see it, you know, you're very entrepreneurial people; real estate people are.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Well, this is a President that will have you in the Oval Office.
Trump	1	Great businessman, by the way.
Trump	1	Just explain -- and I could go over those.
Trump	1	When they talk about African American and what they want to do, I say, "Well, I have not much to say, except that we've just hit the absolute lowest unemployment rate for African Americans in the history of our country.
Trump	1	He's an incredible manager.
Trump	1	That's true.
Trump	1	My Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration, while modernizing our legal immigration system, which has been in terrible shape for many, many decades to prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves for them actually and contribute to our economy, people that come in on merit, merit, merit -- instead of random lotteries and chain migration.
Trump	1	No longer.
Trump	1	We have a lot of them.
Trump	1	We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, and we will never surrender.
Trump	1	Now is the time for bipartisan action.
Trump	1	It's time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Another $1.6 billion.
Trump	1	You can believe it.
Trump	1	Other than that, it's a very fair deal.
Trump	1	Because in America, we honor work.
Trump	1	Melody?
Trump	1	So we report it ourselves.
Trump	1	Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, witch hunts, and delusions.
Trump	1	And I will tell you, I met mike a long time ago, and I said, "Let's do this."
Trump	1	I mean, they never mention that.
Trump	1	I've been hearing about the blue wave, right?
Trump	1	For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
Trump	1	First of all, he's a super liberal.
Trump	1	I got a bad hand with all these horrible trade deals, NAFTA is a disaster, Mexico is going to make over one hundred billion dollars in the United States this year, Canada, you know, Canada, nice guy, nice guy, Prime Minister Justin, I said, "Justin, what's your problem, Justin?"
Trump	1	And that's what's happening.
Trump	1	We make more money than they do.
Trump	1	And, Steve, could you come up and tell us about that great success that you're experiencing, especially recently?
Trump	1	So we take that out of the equation.
Trump	1	We shot 110.
Trump	1	If I would have said that during the campaign, oh they would have given me a hard time.
Trump	1	But let's see what happens.
Trump	1	Never get tired of winning.
Trump	1	But what we have is two extremes.
Trump	1	Thank you, Mike.
Trump	1	If you have a cold, if somebody is not feeling well, we say: "Let's delay the vote for three days."
Trump	1	[Audience yells No] No?
Trump	1	Yet when a Bernie Sanders supporter tried to murder congressional Republicans and severely wounded -- a great man named Steve Scalise and others -- we did not use that heinous attempt at mass murder for political gain, because that would have been wrong.
Trump	1	He didn't know what hit him.
Trump	1	He said to me, "Hey" -- and they all call me "Mr.
Trump	1	This is crazy what we're doing.
Trump	1	They just wanted me to make a fair platform.
Trump	1	There's no administration ever that's cut as many regulations.
Trump	1	Now wages are rising because more jobs are happening.
Trump	1	Gonna be there for a long time.
Trump	1	I -- nobody called me.
Trump	1	You deserve it.
Trump	1	We're also joined by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt.
Trump	1	They maybe should go before high school.
Trump	1	Cory Booker, Pocahontas, Pocahontas.
Trump	1	 We love that song, but let's get going.
Trump	1	Be careful with those stairs, everybody.
Trump	1	Resist and revenge.
Trump	1	So you're going to decide, maybe, which party controls the United States Senate.
Trump	1	Our economy is the strongest it has ever been.
Trump	1	And we can never allow that to happen.
Trump	1	See, I view that as a negative.
Trump	1	In fact, if you look -- chain of command -- if you look, President, Vice President -- I don't know exactly where the Secretary of Agriculture is, but it's right up there at the top, because we really were about farming, and we still are about farming.
Trump	1	Well before we begin, I have to tell you that runway is like an ice skating rink and the first step, I said, "You know this sucker is slippery."
Trump	1	And that doesn't mean you don't have cells and these crazy people, I got to say it, because you saw it, you can never say, "We won," because if you say, "We won," and then somebody blows up a store, some crazy maniac.
Trump	1	We get 'em the hell out of our country.
Trump	1	These are great Americans.
Trump	1	Every day it's promises made and promises kept.
Trump	1	Because the country is doing so well, it's so successful that everybody wants to come here.
Trump	1	We will continue to confirm judges who will interpret our Constitution as written.
Trump	1	But nobody had any idea it was going to happen this quickly.
Trump	1	Been a long time, hasn't it?
Trump	1	Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests.
Trump	1	It's amazing.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	First responders were great.
Trump	1	And, by the way, I have to thank Dean Heller for helping us with Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh.
Trump	1	Does anyone know?
Trump	1	Is that good?
Trump	1	But it really has been an incredible journey for all of us.
Trump	1	You know, when the NFL is down 20 percent, it's the flag.
Trump	1	Can you believe?
Trump	1	You know, he killed four people.
Trump	1	That worked out OK.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Remember -- and then when I knocked it -- or wasn't it like stay with me?
Trump	1	Like YMCA; or United States Marine Corps, with an "A" at the end.
Trump	1	No, I will say, even Chuck Schumer liked it.
Trump	1	You can look at so many different things, we're doing better than ever before, and it's largely because of people like you.
Trump	1	Good job.
Trump	1	The men are OK. What the heck?
Trump	1	Then I started calling people back.
Trump	1	And he put a picture of an empty arena.
Trump	1	It was really good if you want to see everybody leave our country.
Trump	1	They always will criticize.
Trump	1	It was on television.
Trump	1	These people appreciate it.
Trump	1	This isn't what it was 25 years ago.
Trump	1	We used to call it a "puddle."
Trump	1	There's nothing to negotiate.
Trump	1	Eh, who cares?
Trump	1	It's amazing what you can do with cutting regulations that are unnecessary.
Trump	1	All of that we've done with the jobs and the salaries and the wages that are rising for the first time in 21 years, they're going to take it away from you so fast.
Trump	1	Remember that?
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	Even if you find out bad things, you catch them and you release them.
Trump	1	But they knew that America had to prevail.
Trump	1	We get it done.
Trump	1	It's a hoax.
Trump	1	It's what it sounds like.
Trump	1	How can they be opposed?
Trump	1	So I sort of feel guilty about this whole thing because what happened is he said, sir, if you would like me to do it I'll do it.
Trump	1	We never left center stage.
Trump	1	He's the guy.
Trump	1	And we sold this thing for $250 million.
Trump	1	In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] Not much of an impact.
Trump	1	And U.S. Steel announced a $750 million investment in Gary, Indiana.
Trump	1	Big thing.
Trump	1	They didn't have a lot of money.
Trump	1	You go to a movie then you come home.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	So give me some reinforcements please.
Trump	1	Your organization is incredible.
Trump	1	We don't want a lottery system.
Trump	1	Soon it will be history.
Trump	1	Great unifier.
Trump	1	Thompson and the great Lou Barletta -- going to be your next senator I hope.
Trump	1	[Audience Chants USA] And we have a lot of your Congress men and women.
Trump	1	He's chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and they've been investigating this Russia hoax for two years.
Trump	1	We were going to have any new man -- it was going down 600,000 and it's going to be increasing by a lot because you have a lot of companies pouring into Michigan and your other great states.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	Great job.
Trump	1	We're going to give 350 million people an education.
Trump	1	[Applause] I will always fight for an immigration system that defends our borders and takes care of our sovereignty as a nation.
Trump	1	It's all changing.
Trump	1	That's not.
Trump	1	Hey, it's the queen right?
Trump	1	We need those votes in D.C.
Trump	1	So, look, we love the Canadians, but they've done very well with us over the last 35 years.
Trump	1	He loves Missouri.
Trump	1	It looks like they're only moving one way.
Trump	1	And we're going to get him the sand, OK?
Trump	1	Their markets are down 30 percent.
Trump	1	You're going to win."
Trump	1	"No.
Trump	1	You know what it is?
Trump	1	He's running against Sherrod Brown, and Sherrod voted no on our tax cuts.
Trump	1	The individual mandate is gone.
Trump	1	We have clean air.
Trump	1	This is a pretty big one, I must say.
Trump	1	I'm not thrilled.
Trump	1	We're so strong again, so strong.
Trump	1	They call it a nest, a nest of these killers.
Trump	1	Vote for Lou.
Trump	1	And I also want to thank Mayor Steve Voss, we had a great conversation and Governor, Gavin Newsom, had a great conversation and we stand together.
Trump	1	[Applause] We racked up trillions of dollars in trade deficits, also known as losses, while other countries stole our factories, stole our plants, stole our wealth and stole our jobs.
Trump	1	This is a guy he's -- he's almost got -- most of them do have, but this one's too proud to cry, but he had tears.
Trump	1	We won the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court.
Trump	1	I don't see one hand.
Trump	1	We got a that.
Trump	1	He loves Israel.
Trump	1	[Booing] But we're turning it around.
Trump	1	At the heart of the crisis are the 9th Circuit rulings in the Flores case and the Trafficking Victims, Protection Reauthorization Act, driving a staggering surge of illegal families and minors into the hands of our incredible border patrol people.
Trump	1	It's going up rapidly.
Trump	1	"Have a good time, Donald," as I wave goodbye to Fifth Avenue.
Trump	1	That was my last speech.
Trump	1	Three people on that stage.
Trump	1	So I'm here for Kevin Cramer.
Trump	1	We're going to be proud of America again.
Trump	1	And we toured it, and we had a ribbon-cutting a few months ago.
Trump	1	They want to unleash violent predators and ruthless killers -- and you know it.
Trump	1	You know it sounds so nice, the European Union.
Trump	1	Nothing at all.
Trump	1	First with MAGA I never thought MAGA was going to catch on.
Trump	1	Sometimes I think, "Maybe is it possible that they don't?"
Trump	1	Is that really some way to get elected?
Trump	1	We got you the tax cuts.
Trump	1	Hes too nice.
Trump	1	The African-American unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in history — history.
Trump	1	Or put them in the clinker.
Trump	1	I said, "Why is it better?"
Trump	1	We also passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor instead of waiting online for 12 days, for 24 days, for 38 days.
Trump	1	Kristi, could you come up please?
Trump	1	So, now what do we have?
Trump	1	You look at all the places -- here?
Trump	1	 Thank you, folks.
Trump	1	By the way, there is nothing better than a good old-fashioned German Shepherd.
Trump	1	I said to him yesterday I said General: do you think we really needed this?
Trump	1	Are you watching this and our laws are so weak, they're, so pathetic, given to us by Democrats, they're so pathetic, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and let me tell you, we've gotten Mexico to work with us on stopping a lot of what's pouring in, but we have the Worst laws anywhere in the world, we don't have borders, we're gonna build the wall, we're getting it.
Trump	1	I said, "That's the most incredible thing."
Trump	1	I have poor guys, middle of the road, I have rich guys.
Trump	1	But we'll get him eventually.
Trump	1	Look, I like Mexico.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And I remember him; he tanked when he got into the tank.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products made right here in the USA.
Trump	1	No.
Trump	1	Because that's what's going to end up.
Trump	1	I hope not.
Trump	1	We all worked together.
Trump	1	He gives us tremendous credit.
Trump	1	We have accountability, approach, we're getting choice approved and I pulled it because I didn't like the choice.
Trump	1	All over the world, in some cases it was morning you go to Asia, you go to Europe, you go all over, it was just record setting.
Trump	1	And it would have been a whole different story.
Trump	1	The Republican Party is the party for all Americans, that's what it is, it really is, and common sense.
Trump	1	Our country is doing so well -- possibly as well as it's ever done.
Trump	1	It's going a lot higher.
Trump	1	You know, it's all happening much faster than anybody could believe.
Trump	1	I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and go out and vote for a Republican House and a Republican Senate and Republicans at every level of government.
Trump	1	Congress must also act to fix, however, our horrible, obsolete, weak, pathetic immigration laws.
Trump	1	They have been incredible for me in Washington.
Trump	1	Record high.
Trump	1	Bring people together.
Trump	1	There's never been anything, right?
Trump	1	Other than that, we'll be doing very well.
Trump	1	We're so far ahead of schedule, it's incredible.
Trump	1	Now you got to understand.
Trump	1	Maria assembled a team from the IRS, the FBI, and Tampa Police to take down a violent street gang in Tampa, Florida.
Trump	1	And you see we have more caravans forming.
Trump	1	And Chrysler is building Detroit’s first new car factory in a generation -- so long ago -- in a generation.
Trump	1	That's another beauty.
Trump	1	It's called the Tax Cut, Cut, Cut, Cut, Cut Bill of 2017."
Trump	1	We can't allow that to happen.
Trump	1	And I left -- think of it, Election Day, and I left, and I said, "You know, I don't know why we're going to lose."
Trump	1	Forty-eight thousand jobs between that and the Dakota Access Pipeline.
Trump	1	Even they will say that.
Trump	1	And by the way, women are for that more than anybody would understand.
Trump	1	People have no idea how bad they are.
Trump	1	So it's two and a half percent versus 25 percent, somehow I'm looking at this rich guy right over here, that doesn't work too well, do you agree?
Trump	1	But the radical Democrats are trying to destroy all of our country's tremendous achievement and our country's tremendous success.
Trump	1	Not only did we gain New Orleans, we doubled the size of the United States; we secured new parts and ports -- new parts of the map and globe that we never thought, and new ports, very importantly for American agriculture; and we made our nation the greatest farm country on God's Earth.
Trump	1	He's not exactly thrilled about approving them, that I can tell you.
Trump	1	Where is Jim?
Trump	1	But once we got in there, he's been rock solid and he's been great and he's going to do a job, and he cut your taxes and nobody fought harder to cut taxes than Dean Heller, I will tell you that.
Trump	1	Resist.
Trump	1	They were willing to spend tens of millions for a site.
Trump	1	Texas, you're smart, you're tough.
Trump	1	Nothing -- use that word.
Trump	1	We're also thrilled to be joined by a North Carolina native, because I love NASCAR.
Trump	1	We're giving our workers and businesses a level playing field.
Trump	1	One of these guys said recently, "Whether you like him or not, he's actually fulfilled more promises than he made," and I have.
Trump	1	Look, so much is happening now in space.
Trump	1	And South Carolina.
Trump	1	He grew up in a certain nice location in New York, like Fifth Avenue.
Trump	1	But they don't, it's very, very sad.
Trump	1	And a popular governor.
Trump	1	The deductibles are so high that nobody gets to use it unless you're in serious condition so serious that, frankly, the last thing on your mind is health care.
Trump	1	The hand-picked candidate of Chuck Schumer.
Trump	1	It's the largest bill in American history.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] Caravan, I think that was one of mine, but it looked like a caravan.
Trump	1	Great guy.
Trump	1	We are bringing it back.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	I mean they are an incredible, really: an incredible company, they're, building a fantastic plant and it's under construction now and they're going out and they're recruiting and they're getting people and they're doing it professionally.
Trump	1	It's embarrassing to watch those people make fools of themselves as they scream and shout at this great gentleman.
Trump	1	We have so many other things.
Trump	1	That'll do it.
Trump	1	And space, from a military standpoint, is really the new frontier.
Trump	1	If House Democrats control the committees and control the floor, they will block every single effort to secure our borders and to defend our communities.
Trump	1	That's OK. You know what, we've learned how to live with them.
Trump	1	We're knocking the hell out of the terrorists.
Trump	1	We pick up one point.
Trump	1	What did you do?
Trump	1	That's a big thing.
Trump	1	We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal and in just the last year, our coal exports have skyrocketed.
Trump	1	And they said they buy their coal now, because of me, from West Virginia.
Trump	1	And better than riding it on top, on the railroads.
Trump	1	We're going to be great.
Trump	1	They left a mess, I have to tell you.
Trump	1	Wonderful deal for both.
Trump	1	OPEC and OPEC nations, are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I don’t like it.
Trump	1	It seems like it's a long ways away.
Trump	1	Sleepy Joe said that he's running to quote "save the world."
Trump	1	I still say, however, expensing -- one year -- expensing will be the star of what we're doing.
Trump	1	We just made it.
Trump	1	Congressman Joe Lesko and Debbie -- Mrs. Lesko.
Trump	1	Now it's going to cost $900 million and it took 21 years to get it approved.
Trump	1	Our -- and I'm in no rush because I'm fine with it.
Trump	1	Ted's opponent, Kathy Manning, is an extreme liberal Democrat... and a donor, as they said, and a donor to the campaign of Nancy Pelosi.
Trump	1	It's a passion for the country.
Trump	1	You pay the ultimate price.
Trump	1	And we will always fight on to victory.
Trump	1	Thanks, Steve.
Trump	1	We reformed the Medicare drug discount program to stop hospitals from overcharging low-income seniors, saving seniors hundreds of millions of dollars this year alone.
Trump	1	And they want to keep DACA for the campaign instead of getting it approved, which we could do very easily.
Trump	1	True.
Trump	1	Those big beautiful buildings in Manhattan.
Trump	1	I don't think so, right?
Trump	1	I'm so proud of that.
Trump	1	She said creepy Joe.
Trump	1	OK. Good.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I meant it.
Trump	1	Get them up here.
Trump	1	Americans should not be forced to subsidize lower drug prices in foreign countries while paying the highest drug prices ever in the history of this world.
Trump	1	It's already open.
Trump	1	Today.
Trump	1	But I have this executive -- and I'm getting ready to sign it.
Trump	1	And just this week, your Democrat governor, and by the way, by the way we have Scott Walker, he's here.
Trump	1	These left wing extremists don't believe America has the right to enforce our immigration laws or decide who gets to enter and remain in our country, not going to be that way.
Trump	1	But the Democrat Party.
Trump	1	I don't think.
Trump	1	Hey, they're not so stupid, when you think about it, right?
Trump	1	"Sir, we're better off."
Trump	1	The Democrats, they call themselves the resistance.
Trump	1	And I just want to thank you for your understanding.
Trump	1	You know about that, right?
Trump	1	The Republican Party will always protect patients with preexisting condition.
Trump	1	You ask.
Trump	1	Other steel companies all over the country, they're opening up plants.
Trump	1	We're going to give you free everything.
Trump	1	But if she should be the candidate, which I tend to doubt, but if she should be, we'll bring it up again and I think it'll be very successful, 1024.
Trump	1	Which CBS, I just heard, just joined the crew, and ESPN have decided not to broadcast, so they don't have any controversy.
Trump	1	Hasn’t been for me.
Trump	1	And they voted most importantly to make America great again.
Trump	1	The Democrat record on health care is one of deception and destruction.
Trump	1	All I have to do is thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen.
Trump	1	And that’s true.
Trump	1	Not on judges.
Trump	1	And President Obama made a speech.
Trump	1	They get one that they like.
Trump	1	But for 10 years, the intellect, the scholastic ability, the legal genius.
Trump	1	Goodbye, darling.
Trump	1	And it's clean and it's environmentally better than the alternatives.
Trump	1	He has won statewide a number of times so he's been -- he's been through it but he's won statewide.
Trump	1	They were even ordering their pipe.
Trump	1	Unemployment just reached the lowest rate in more than 50 years.
Trump	1	So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too good.
Trump	1	And you have the greatest coach in football."
Trump	1	We got to have.
Trump	1	Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we are taking back our country and returning power to where it belongs, the American people.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	This was the finest…" He was explaining to me about cotton.
Trump	1	We have to get the military taken care of.
Trump	1	So when people got to the booth, they said, "Ah, we're going to vote Democrat.
Trump	1	We can do that.
Trump	1	But that's a great thing, right?
Trump	1	A very special person.
Trump	1	Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing.
Trump	1	Democrats have signed up for a socialist takeover of American health care that would utterly destroy Medicare and Rob our seniors of the benefits they paid into their entire lives.
Trump	1	Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue.
Trump	1	I was called by everybody, and I now understand why nobody did it.
Trump	1	[Applause] And we're not finished yet.
Trump	1	We want to have work requirements.
Trump	1	And I said, "You know, I want you to be my ad buyer."
Trump	1	Come up, Cindy.
Trump	1	We were going to be in Syria for four months.
Trump	1	 Oh, that is something.
Trump	1	He said, "You've got to go with Trump."
Trump	1	Should we bring Phil up here?
Trump	1	Republicans produce jobs.
Trump	1	accountability.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] And very importantly, we saved our family farms and our small businesses from the estate tax, also known as the death tax.
Trump	1	This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, and common sense.
Trump	1	Median household income has hit the highest level ever recorded.
Trump	1	Companies are coming back into our country; they want the action.
Trump	1	Japan, I was speaking to Prime Minister Abe the other day.
Trump	1	You saw Chrysler announce, many are announcing.
Trump	1	She paid like a million dollars for some guy to make the slogan.
Trump	1	For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth, shutter our factories, and steal our jobs.
Trump	1	You do a great job, thank you.
Trump	1	There never has been anybody like him.
Trump	1	But he didn't want to disappoint me.
Trump	1	The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE.
Trump	1	It's a sad situation.
Trump	1	[Laughter] In your whole life you've been criticized by her or him but all of the sudden they think you are the single greatest investor.
Trump	1	But ultimately, it was all very important to get this to a point where now we really have a relationship.
Trump	1	And this is a pretty urgent problem.
Trump	1	We got to win tomorrow, Fred.
Trump	1	You're both happy.
Trump	1	I represented you well.
Trump	1	This, that's true because our amazing chairwoman, the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel, she's done some job and if you remember, she ran the state of Michigan and who won the state of Michigan after decades.
Trump	1	They got them almost immediately.
Trump	1	And I give them credit, I have to tell you, Novartis, Pfizer and some others.
Trump	1	Great place.
Trump	1	It was a disgrace, OK?
Trump	1	 Our country is currently facing a crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border.
Trump	1	And my relationship with Kim Jong-un is very good.
Trump	1	Now you have a president who is standing up for America... more than ever before.
Trump	1	And I'm going to Vietnam, to Hanoi, in the near future, 27th and 28th of February, to have another summit and hope we -- hopefully we do as well with the second summit as we did with the first.
Trump	1	And it's driving them crazy.
Trump	1	And this was unthinkable, because four years ago, steel plants were closing, they weren't expanding, and they weren't building.
Trump	1	We've done that in less than two years.
Trump	1	They'll say OK.
Trump	1	That's not happening.
Trump	1	[Laughter] In China, they go back -- they go back 8,000 years.
Trump	1	Revenge, crazy hoaxes like we just went through, and ridiculous conspiracy theories.
Trump	1	They'd say, no, it may harm you.
Trump	1	He said, "Yes, we're going to" -- I said, "You can't do that for $50 million."
Trump	1	And bring him up?
Trump	1	The economic policies of the previous administration and rich foreign nations at the expense of our nation, and not only the previous administration, many administrations before them.
Trump	1	[Laughter and applause] America’s economy is booming like never before.
Trump	1	But we're keeping the wrong ones out, okay?
Trump	1	Wow.
Trump	1	But we're not going to let them gain power.
Trump	1	I just made him a big star.
Trump	1	We gave them the largest pay raise in more than a decade.
Trump	1	You would be amazed.
Trump	1	The American armed forces sixth branch is called the Space Force.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	No, I don't want that wall built.
Trump	1	And we won big, 306-223.
Trump	1	Very much appreciated.
Trump	1	It's good.
Trump	1	Socialism is not a good thing, you are right.
Trump	1	So nobody knows better.
Trump	1	And we are doing it all with love in our hearts, joy in our souls, and trust in our God.
Trump	1	I said it's going to much higher.
Trump	1	Have you seen what they've done?
Trump	1	Get out of here, Jim, get out.
Trump	1	More than ever before, by far.
Trump	1	Thank you, Missouri.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	For years and years we've been protecting these countries.
Trump	1	It's horrible.
Trump	1	We did well with the men, too.
Trump	1	Apprenticeships, on-the-job-training, and vocational education.
Trump	1	They're going into North Carolina.
Trump	1	And only for the great oil professionals in the room, we're getting those pipelines approved so fast you'll be able to practically double up on oil production, oil and gas.
Trump	1	You know, like, sometimes if you like somebody you get along, good chemistry, the time goes by.
Trump	1	President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed.
Trump	1	They're getting more people than some of the presidential elections.
Trump	1	America is governed by Americans.
Trump	1	They have massive tariffs on our people, on our workers, on our farmers, on our country, on our companies.
Trump	1	So let's let them be the elite, but with the super elite, there's not even a contest.
Trump	1	The word irredeemable is -- well, it turned out to be deplorable was the word that caught on, right?
Trump	1	I didn't hear that one, but I don't know if anyone's thought of it, but that's like a natural.
Trump	1	That's your best market.
Trump	1	We'll be another Venezuela.
Trump	1	Senator Ron Johnson.
Trump	1	Highly respected.
Trump	1	We've got to make the right deal.
Trump	1	We are going to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Trump	1	They want America to be a giant sanctuary city for gang members and MS-13 killers.
Trump	1	He's great.
Trump	1	It was in very bad shape.
Trump	1	So last quarter, we hit GDP 4.1, adjusted upward 4.2 percent, right?
Trump	1	USA, nothing like it.
Trump	1	They said it was far too short.
Trump	1	But you're only paying for a percentage of your military.
Trump	1	It's called "Keep America Great," because what we're doing is incredible.
Trump	1	And Nancy.
Trump	1	Jim Jordan, a great guy.
Trump	1	And now we have that running beautifully and they're loaning, and they're nice people.
Trump	1	Catherine reminds us that every life is sacred and that every child is a precious gift from God.
Trump	1	You know why?
Trump	1	Remember that line.
Trump	1	We fixed the building up a little bit.
Trump	1	People don't realize William McKinley from Ohio was a great president.
Trump	1	The people of Florida are going to reject socialism and elect Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott.
Trump	1	So Mexico now, for the first time, has been taking people back to Honduras and Guatemala, and El Salvador, and other countries, and for the first time, not big enough numbers but they're getting bigger, they're getting bigger.
Trump	1	Because America's winning again.
Trump	1	You're not hearing so much.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	You pour out your hearts to earn a living, you create loving homes for your family, and you teach your children to cherish our values and to cherish our great American flag.
Trump	1	I said Rolls Royce and they said, no he doesn't.
Trump	1	So we have -- we've done a good job with that.
Trump	1	On September 11th, 2001, the sister raced to Ground Zero.
Trump	1	And if you don't mind we're going to take a little bit of money out of the $100 billion that we're saving we're going to take a little bit of money.
Trump	1	He voted to cut your taxes, protect your pre-existing conditions, build a border wall, which we're working on, and wait until you see what we're doing next week.
Trump	1	He wasn't ready.
Trump	1	My message to communities under siege from drug and gangs and violence is: you can stop this, and you can stop it cold.
Trump	1	So, they said I was late, when I was actually early, number one.
Trump	1	He's agreed to make it a controlled substance and the highest criminality.
Trump	1	I mean, how do you make a deal like that?
Trump	1	For nobody else.
Trump	1	Who knows.
Trump	1	I don't think he cried when we was a baby.
Trump	1	I've had such an incredible experience with the miners.
Trump	1	Your taxes will triple.
Trump	1	And he was the one that asked Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Trump	1	That's right.
Trump	1	Think of it: We charge them essentially nothing; they charge us 25 percent.
Trump	1	That's where it's at.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	We love Josh.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	Number two, what's happening is we're taking in billions and billions -- look at the steel.
Trump	1	Because people realize how important the Supreme Court is.
Trump	1	Who thinks... She was very unprepared for that question.
Trump	1	Every day we're setting new records and we're keeping our promise.
Trump	1	If I would have said this, I've been to Ohio so many times, been to every part of Ohio.
Trump	1	There's no tax.
Trump	1	Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and who, by the way, paid for it.
Trump	1	He's standing at second base.
Trump	1	You see what's going on.
Trump	1	You know, I called up Pfizer and some of the great drug companies.
Trump	1	And they were great Jody Hice.
Trump	1	Bill Nelson voted in favor of sanctuary cities ... [Booing] He opposed Kate's Law.
Trump	1	Ever before.
Trump	1	If Stacey Abrams gets in, your second amendment is... is gone, gone.
Trump	1	I’ll give you a hint.
Trump	1	We've withdrawn from the job killing, an unbelievably expensive Paris climate accord.
Trump	1	We have set records on arrests at the borders.
Trump	1	You know who our governor is, right?
Trump	1	Big ratings.
Trump	1	So you know, I said, "You know what, I want more."
Trump	1	These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our very proud American heritage.
Trump	1	In fact, next week, we will confirm our 100th federal judge.
Trump	1	Nicole, please come up.
Trump	1	We cannot allow ourselves... to be pushed around.
Trump	1	Time flies.
Trump	1	The Democrats plan to destroy health care.
Trump	1	They put names and you pick a name.
Trump	1	You got to pay, Angela.
Trump	1	And their extreme job-killing agenda.
Trump	1	That's all we want.
Trump	1	And you have happy people.
Trump	1	And the incredible leadership team at the National Electrical Contractors Association.
Trump	1	What happens if we don't have steel and we need it for military conflict?
Trump	1	These are sick people and there has to be accountability because it's all lies and they know it's lies.
Trump	1	You know what a fake poll is.
Trump	1	We will not bend.
Trump	1	Save that flag, we love our country, we love our country, but we're afraid of it for purposes of getting into the United States, we're afraid of our country.
Trump	1	And, by the way, she got the biggest, by far -- [Laughter] -- including you, Ivanka, and including all of my political geniuses out here.
Trump	1	Where is Richard?
Trump	1	This is a movement built on love for our nation and love for our fellow citizen.
Trump	1	Vote for Lou.
Trump	1	But he's out there fighting.
Trump	1	[Laughter] They were not happy.
Trump	1	They were going into Iraq, they were taking everything.
Trump	1	That is a narrow runway.
Trump	1	I never said -- I couldn't say that.
Trump	1	You know that, right?
Trump	1	I can just tell you, when we came in, before I came in, and at the beginning when the rhetoric was tough, right, that rhetoric was tough, these people were saying, "Oh, he's going to get us into a war."
Trump	1	And I'm fighting for you, and I think you see that, not easy, but I love it and the reason I love it because there have been few presidents that have been able to do what we've been able to do for you, and it is a great great feeling, thank you.
Trump	1	And maybe on that one, we're going to work with the Democrats to be honest, because they want to get it down too and we'll see if we can put it all together.
Trump	1	So I think we're going to do well.
Trump	1	We are standing up for Tennessee.
Trump	1	We love going to work.
Trump	1	We withdrew from the horrible Paris Climate agreement.
Trump	1	Learn your heritage.
Trump	1	He's going to start -- why is he saying these things?
Trump	1	You deliver for us.
Trump	1	This is -- and they don't even correct me when I say it.
Trump	1	No.
Trump	1	We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never, ever, ever back down.
Trump	1	We are one people and one family with one glorious American destiny.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	I am thrilled to be back in my second home.
Trump	1	And the Georgia Attorney General, Chris Carr.
Trump	1	And you just take a look at the border, OK?
Trump	1	I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's going to be great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business.
Trump	1	It's in your blood.
Trump	1	The heroes that came before us did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while other tries to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage.
Trump	1	And I'm sorry women to disappoint you - this is tough, but I did win that women's vote, didn't I?
Trump	1	We have -- to others we give hundreds of millions of dollars.
Trump	1	[Laughter] How about changing some of them to two years, too?
Trump	1	It's got to be a good deal.
Trump	1	I mean, some people have spent an entire lifetime trying to get a project approved, and they don't get it approved, and their working career is, like, mostly over.
Trump	1	Thank you all.
Trump	1	And we've approved immediately -- like first day, first week -- the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipelines.
Trump	1	The choice for our country's future has never been clearer than it is today.
Trump	1	You know, you're negotiating -- and I'm telling Mexico and Canada, hey, I don't care if we ever make a deal, and then I'll have congressmen and senators standing up saying he must make a deal with Canada, he must make a deal with Mexico.
Trump	1	They'll figure something out.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	And God bless the United States of America.
Trump	1	Well, just the opposite happened, just the opposite happened.
Trump	1	Thank you, Michael.
Trump	1	Nobody has ever done what we've done.
Trump	1	And we got the individual mandate, the absolute worst part of Obamacare, eliminated.
Trump	1	And nobody knew that was going to happen, because we had it done.
Trump	1	You never will have to find out.
Trump	1	Where's Billy?
Trump	1	I met.
Trump	1	But if they took it it's a 25 percent tax, okay, so think of it so think of it.
Trump	1	They come from socialist countries.
Trump	1	He actually had a lot of money left over.
Trump	1	Even I said how did that happen?
Trump	1	Thank you, honey.
Trump	1	They said, “Oh, it’s not that bad.” Well, let me tell you, that statement was peanuts compared to reality.
Trump	1	And congratulations to VFW s incoming leadership, BJ Lawrence and Sandy Kreebull.
Trump	1	And I said, "Bring the cameras.
Trump	1	Let's blame Russia.
Trump	1	I said, "$1 billion?"
Trump	1	They get punished when they get home.
Trump	1	Violently punched.
Trump	1	He sold the house for a hundred million dollars.
Trump	1	But we had the greatest -- but look at the -- look at this.
Trump	1	They want to outlaw private health insurance.
Trump	1	I could go on all night.
Trump	1	Last year, we had $817 billion trade deficit.
Trump	1	It's crazy.
Trump	1	Where is Ron?
Trump	1	Thank you, honey.
Trump	1	 Thank you.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	They're amazed by how much she loves them and how much they love her.
Trump	1	The horror that they had to endure by these people like Blumenthal and Cory Booker who was a disaster as the mayor of Newark New Jersey.
Trump	1	In grammar school, I learned that.
Trump	1	Democrats, a visa lottery, a lottery, countries, a lottery.
Trump	1	We have launched a historic effort to combat the opioid -- where I know you have a big problem here -- the opioid epidemic, signing the largest bill focused on fighting opioid addiction, and fighting the spread of opioid all over this country.
Trump	1	Thank you, Earl.
Trump	1	I'm an Air Force One.
Trump	1	She was talking -- this is a man who is totally brilliant.
Trump	1	I've got time.
Trump	1	They helped me, and them, and you, and everybody with the largest tax cuts this country has ever seen and with the cutting of regulation.
Trump	1	The only thing I worry about is that some total unknown that nobody ever heard of comes along, but you know what, honestly, with what we've done on jobs on our country and our military, we're going to talk about our veterans what we've done.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Right?
Trump	1	You know what happens?
Trump	1	Do you mind if I play with your hair?
Trump	1	Let's not take a chance, OK?
Trump	1	Austin deserves it.
Trump	1	Your 401(k)s -- I stand up all the time with great Americans.
Trump	1	I got to go.
Trump	1	If anything should happen at all, nobody will ever have suffered the consequences that they will suffer.
Trump	1	Hey, Mike and John, could you do me a favor?
Trump	1	And I used to think, "Wow, this guy is a pretty brave guy."
Trump	1	[Audience Chants Trump] Hispanic American poverty has reached an all-time historic low.
Trump	1	They were looking to the Mediterranean, which is very far away.
Trump	1	I think those things are -- you know, those things are pretty important, right?
Trump	1	No President, no matter how long they've been in office -- even though we're only here for a short time -- has cut anywhere near the regulations.
Trump	1	Would you do that?
Trump	1	So I called Sonny Perdue, our great Secretary of Agriculture, and I said, "Sonny…" -- I said, "Sonny, what's the biggest amount they've ever spent in this country?"
Trump	1	Phil -- whatever the hell his name is -- this guy will 100 percent vote against us every single time.
Trump	1	We mourn for the unthinkable loss of life that took place today, and we pledge in their name to fight for a future of justice, safety, tolerance, morality, dignity, and love.
Trump	1	We're standing up for Tennessee.
Trump	1	So important.
Trump	1	This guy's a champion.
Trump	1	Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.
Trump	1	That was supposed to be a big deal.
Trump	1	It's greater.
Trump	1	We call it The Russian hoax.
Trump	1	And we are fighting every day for our great ranchers and loggers and farmers, and we're winning that fight and we're winning it quickly.
Trump	1	I don't know.
Trump	1	We're finishing the wall.
Trump	1	You're losing all your car companies, they're all leaving.
Trump	1	I went to my people.
Trump	1	And remember this, remember this, for Ted and for all of -- for all of these people, including the ones that aren't here for any reason other than their supporting Mark and Ted, the Democrats they are going to raise your taxes.
Trump	1	Martha's a veteran.
Trump	1	They've been trying to get this for 30 years -- accountability.
Trump	1	Tragically, as we've seen, there's no sign more inviting to a mass killer than a sign that declares, This school is a gun-free zone.
Trump	1	For decades, the United States opened its economy -- the largest, by far, on Earth -- with few conditions.
Trump	1	He wanted to do this, and I said, "Go ahead."
Trump	1	He was one of the best wrestlers in the history of college wrestling.
Trump	1	And I learned from that.
Trump	1	So I don't know.
Trump	1	We have to take care of pre-existing conditions, because it's just the way life is, folks.
Trump	1	I agree.
Trump	1	They are giving us their worst people and so would you and so would I. Visa lottery.
Trump	1	That's okay.
Trump	1	The economy is maybe the best it's ever been ever, I think -- ever.
Trump	1	They don't want to see our force again.
Trump	1	But thank you very much for hosting us today, along with two other great energy leaders, President of Renewable Fuels Association Geoff Cooper and CEO of Growth Energy Emily Skor.
Trump	1	[Applause] But there is a complacency, and I can understand it.
Trump	1	How about that one?
Trump	1	I used to complain about it as a civilian.
Trump	1	Thank you, Sonny.
Trump	1	Remember that day?
Trump	1	And that's when I realized this is a very powerful office.
Trump	1	And, by the way, in Missouri, I was just told by Josh, it's at 3.2 percent, which is the lowest in the history of the state.
Trump	1	That's a lot of people.
Trump	1	We're protecting -- you got to pay.
Trump	1	I said, that's good music.
Trump	1	I've been here a lot lately, John.
Trump	1	I told you.
Trump	1	He really has, he's a big-steel guy very like, as big as you get, and he was just fighting a battle when he was the head of Nucor, right, Nucor.
Trump	1	He said, two hours before, he was voting to repeal and replace.
Trump	1	Great job.
Trump	1	Democrats want judges who will rewrite the Constitution to impose their own radical views.
Trump	1	We see it in sons and daughters who cheer on moms and dads as they recover.
Trump	1	I would watch wealthy people travel all over the world trying to find a cure.
Trump	1	We have tamed continents.
Trump	1	And thank you very much, Bill -- you and John, and the whole group.
Trump	1	I could go help with the Olympics.
Trump	1	They take such advantage.
Trump	1	It should be part of the dialogue of the next election.
Trump	1	Scott is doing a great job.
Trump	1	"Murder."
Trump	1	I am afraid for my life.
Trump	1	I can think of a little bit lower down the ladder.
Trump	1	And, you know, you have Dusty Johnson.
Trump	1	How about this?
Trump	1	They've helped so much.
Trump	1	And veteran unemployment is now at the lowest level ever, ever, ever recorded.
Trump	1	[Laughter] "Because we're getting ready to land."
Trump	1	[Applause] And Ronald Reagan -- remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win.
Trump	1	The country puts the name in the basket, and you pick people out of the lottery.
Trump	1	Really hard.
Trump	1	So we're very -- we're very proud of it.
Trump	1	So sad.
Trump	1	To all of the people in this room who serve every day on the frontiers and frontlines of this crisis -- and a crisis it is -- you have earned the gratitude of our entire nation.
Trump	1	I started -- I signed Donald -- and I said, by the way, what is it I'm signing?
Trump	1	They’d travel to Asia if they had money, they’d travel to Europe, they’d travel all over the world hoping for a cure.
Trump	1	Which we do, but there's nothing like the big companies.
Trump	1	I know you.
Trump	1	Since taking office two years ago our economy is now the hottest economy anywhere on Earth.
Trump	1	We don't give up.
Trump	1	We also secured $670 million to repair Air Force facilities, including Offutt Air Force Base -- only a few miles from where we stand today.
Trump	1	He's a champion for our workers, our families, and for our veterans.
Trump	1	 Well, thank you, Montana.
Trump	1	A short time later I traveled to Detroit to cancel burdensome regulations that unfairly harm the motor city.
Trump	1	I don't think you want your Second Amendment played with.
Trump	1	Let's do it again, right?
Trump	1	It sounds so nice, right?
Trump	1	Sir, we've been trying to get that passed for 40 years.
Trump	1	Those days are over too, folks.
Trump	1	But we're almost the double the size of China and far bigger than anybody else.
Trump	1	We don't want somebody stealing that slogan.
Trump	1	They're not moving anymore.
Trump	1	We had it done, but something happened.
Trump	1	It's called energy.
Trump	1	Can you believe -- towns that I grew up right next to.
Trump	1	I'm going to get one of those little kits and in the middle of the debate when she proclaims that she's of Indian heritage because her mother says she has high cheekbones.
Trump	1	Okay?
Trump	1	And Texas is the state where generations of farmers and ranchers and oil workers and pioneers built a life and a home with their own two hands.
Trump	1	Plane loads -- ridiculous.
Trump	1	That's no good, right?
Trump	1	But the big thing is we're building our military stronger than ever before, all of these things are happening.
Trump	1	I said, "I'll call you back next week," because I knew what they were going to ask me.
Trump	1	They never get to put a justice on the Supreme Court.
Trump	1	I was just saying that's awfully tough to beat somebody when I'm debating one of the far left candidates that the Democrats will produce.
Trump	1	I joke that I'll have Patrick Morriseycoming to me soon.
Trump	1	Mexico does nothing for us.
Trump	1	And just like I promised, we are confronting the unfair trade deals, and we are doing it like nobody has ever done, because our workers have been cheated, our companies have been cheated.
Trump	1	The Democrats want to spend more money on health care for an illegal immigrant than they do for a citizen of the United States.
Trump	1	If another person happened to be in this position right now, first of all, they'd be about 10 people instead of all the people -- hey, I wish the cameras could spin around and show this massive field.
Trump	1	She has no Indian blood.
Trump	1	It's ending.
Trump	1	That's what we want.
Trump	1	And I said, "It's easy."
Trump	1	This whole thing is crazy, but we're going to stop it.
Trump	1	So we started the wall.
Trump	1	Their blue wave is really sputtering pretty badly.
Trump	1	They want to stop practically anything.
Trump	1	He's got a 20-point lead.
Trump	1	You think Hillary would do that?
Trump	1	[Laughter] Great going, Kellyanne.
Trump	1	That's going to happen.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] He says open up those borders, let them in.
Trump	1	We've got our hostages back for nothing, out of respect.
Trump	1	And think of the fact -- think of this.
Trump	1	Nobody even talks about it.
Trump	1	Democrats also want open borders.
Trump	1	And you people know that better than anybody.
Trump	1	And I have to tell you, I know a lot of governors.
Trump	1	No tax.
Trump	1	I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls.
Trump	1	We've done a good job.
Trump	1	They didn't even know who was going to be the pick.
Trump	1	What's the big deal?"
Trump	1	I do eventually want to unite.
Trump	1	And they're doing really well.
Trump	1	Kevin.
Trump	1	It's a great thing.
Trump	1	They are helping -- they are helping these smugglers and these traffickers like nobody would believe.
Trump	1	Great job.
Trump	1	I wish we had people that did the same thing in reverse, but we didn't have those people, unfortunately.
Trump	1	You couldn't fire anybody.
Trump	1	That's it.
Trump	1	We are sending a simple message to the lawless caravans and to the illegal trespassers marching forward our border.
Trump	1	And you know what?
Trump	1	No.
Trump	1	No easy job.
Trump	1	I've had a lot of people say, "I don't know what midterm is, but now I'm watching every single minute and I'm going out to vote."
Trump	1	She lied.
Trump	1	We don't need anybody.
Trump	1	They want to make a deal.
Trump	1	They're moving it along.
Trump	1	We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] Somehow, I don't see Indiana being the next Venezuela, I just don't see it, right?
Trump	1	That Electoral College, we won by a lot.
Trump	1	For years you watched as your leaders apologize for America and now you have a president who is standing up for America.
Trump	1	I'm all for NATO.
Trump	1	We actually need workers.
Trump	1	They are beautiful.
Trump	1	Start?
Trump	1	Hey, by the way, you think we're letting that caravan come into this country, you can forget it.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I can never beat George.
Trump	1	Do you think this is fun?
Trump	1	I'm in office for almost two years.
Trump	1	The economy is raging.
Trump	1	Good luck Jimmy.
Trump	1	Even look at what they're doing with our laws, the way they treat our laws, the way they treat country.
Trump	1	We opened it up four months later for $400,000.
Trump	1	$1 billion, land we don't own, will take forever to get it open.
Trump	1	Now it's my great honor to welcome you back to the White House to celebrate six months of new jobs, bigger paychecks, and keeping more of your hard-earned money where it belongs, in your pocket or wherever else you want to spend it.
Trump	1	Thank you, Elko.
Trump	1	Is that true?
Trump	1	Okay, I'm being nice because they will criticize me if I'm not.
Trump	1	Remember that.
Trump	1	I'll give you an example.
Trump	1	Look, we allowed it to happen.
Trump	1	We'll make billions and billions, and they'll say, OK, it's all right.
Trump	1	Our farmers are very important to me.
Trump	1	And I will tell you, I already know, a lot of companies are getting together; they're making incredible deals, Alex.
Trump	1	Companies must also be held accountable.
Trump	1	Very important.
Trump	1	Unfortunately, one senator decided to put the thumb down, late in the morning.
Trump	1	So, last week, I visited a place where -- I essentially grew up right next to it -- to discuss the menace of MS-13.
Trump	1	What a group.
Trump	1	We have created more than 3.4 million new jobs since Election Day.
Trump	1	This is one of the great -- It won't happen.
Trump	1	I really do, I respect it.
Trump	1	You see what they're doing?
Trump	1	Just 22 people.
Trump	1	And we're landing, and I still haven't seen a light.
Trump	1	But we're coming out with things over the next four weeks; you'll like it better than enhanced vetting.
Trump	1	He thinks -- although I have done very well.
Trump	1	Top at Yale, top at Yale Law School.
Trump	1	But I say it's respected like rarely before.
Trump	1	We're going to win so much that you're going to be begging me, please, please, Mr. President, the people of Indiana cannot continue to win like this.
Trump	1	So that's the way it is.
Trump	1	You will face new challenges, even challenges that you can't envision, but you'll find new solutions that nobody can even imagine.
Trump	1	And we will fully secure the border.
Trump	1	Finally, I see them.
Trump	1	We'll get that approved.
Trump	1	We need them for all of the great companies that are coming in.
Trump	1	I said, "How much is that?
Trump	1	They got to pay, you know, when they're wealthy.
Trump	1	You remember the words, the deplorables.
Trump	1	So that's a big thing.
Trump	1	And something that the congressman really helped me with, all of them in the room and Andy, in particular, we help right now get critically ill, terminal patients access to life-saving treatments.
Trump	1	They'd been trying to get it done for 40 years.
Trump	1	I'm "worse than they are; they're worse than we are.
Trump	1	And we don't want to be threatening.
Trump	1	We're bringing back our jobs.
Trump	1	He had retired and the son was flying the same plane.
Trump	1	Thank you, fellas, great job.
Trump	1	And you know what?
Trump	1	And it's the largest tax cut ever approved, ever gotten, in the history of our country.
Trump	1	You're making make a lot of bad decisions in Europe.
Trump	1	And we're changing it rapidly.
Trump	1	Warren?
Trump	1	We had a -- we really did a good job but I can only make so many stops and today I'm making three of them in Mississippi.
Trump	1	Under the Obama administration, we have tremendous amounts of surplus military equipment.
Trump	1	accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our great veterans will be accountable.
Trump	1	Say a little prayer.
Trump	1	No, it's true.
Trump	1	We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible.
Trump	1	Thank you, David.
Trump	1	I want to thank also Kelly Armstrong who is here someplace.
Trump	1	Come on up here.
Trump	1	Our ancestors defeated fascism.
Trump	1	But they took advantage.
Trump	1	African-American unemployment has recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded.
Trump	1	Get away from the Democrats.
Trump	1	Who knows?
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	So true.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I think he's like 128 in one or something crazy like that.
Trump	1	We've recorded the largest number of regulation cuts in the history of our country.
Trump	1	 Unbelievable.
Trump	1	And I had to learn that, too, to win the state.
Trump	1	They release dangerous criminal aliens into our communities.
Trump	1	He said, You know he's going to win.
Trump	1	They said: "I supported you from the beginning."
Trump	1	They were all lies.
Trump	1	Whatever it is, there are a lot of people.
Trump	1	That was a bad one.
Trump	1	Then I said, what the hell, let's run for President.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Someday you'll explain that one to me, please.
Trump	1	And it's costing our country nothing.
Trump	1	And I don't think they're going to cool us off, no matter what they want to do.
Trump	1	"You'd need a magic wand.
Trump	1	Far, far, far greater than anyone thought.
Trump	1	That's why in one of my first acts as President, I withdrew the United States from the one sided job killing disaster known as TPP.
Trump	1	And if they're more -- but, OK, so you're happy for your grandson, right?
Trump	1	But trade, and commerce, and making money for our country, it's all very important, but to me the most important job I have is the security of our country, even more important than those other things that I talk about all the time -- it's the security of our country.
Trump	1	Next year will mark the 120th anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the oldest major veterans organization in our country.
Trump	1	[Applause] Through peer-to-peer networking, coaching, and support, Deborah and her team have helped more than 650 former offenders start new lives as law-abiding members of society.
Trump	1	In other words, I got him into this.
Trump	1	Now they're starting to do better, and they're having their choice of jobs where they can enjoy what they're doing.
Trump	1	Why am I doing this?
Trump	1	I actually did that.
Trump	1	I said does he do this to everybody, to his people?
Trump	1	[Audience chants Lock her up] She made a statement today, they're doing a tour, her and her husband or something.
Trump	1	It's been a long time.
Trump	1	Where are the military?
Trump	1	They'd do whatever they wanted and we'd just put up with it.
Trump	1	You should ask the people.
Trump	1	But forget about everything else.
Trump	1	Did they treat him badly or what?
Trump	1	And I've done a little research on Billie Sutton.
Trump	1	Sometimes I say, "Brian, we've got to talk about another subject.
Trump	1	And if you look over the last 40 years, I don't think we built a refinery, or certainly we built very few of them.
Trump	1	That's a great politician.
Trump	1	It's not pretty at all.
Trump	1	We have to have him.
Trump	1	You couldn't fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists.
Trump	1	On Twitter.
Trump	1	Honestly, you know, I do this stuff for a living.
Trump	1	You can blow up those pipelines.
Trump	1	We will not bend.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] All right, let's get back to some boring subjects like Bob Casey.
Trump	1	Coming up by the thousands.
Trump	1	I said, "David, that almost -- does this make sense?
Trump	1	If we don't win in 2020, everything that we've done -- seriously, though, everything that we've done, your 401s, they're going to crash, the whole thing it's going to come down like a stack of cards.
Trump	1	And this is our pledge.
Trump	1	[Applause] And I put one of my friends as the ambassador to Israel, David Friedman.
Trump	1	I said, if you want, you can tell the Larry Bird story.
Trump	1	That means 401(k)s, that means jobs.
Trump	1	Congressman Joe Wilson and Tom Rice.
Trump	1	They lost limbs.
Trump	1	It's sold out.
Trump	1	Now we have to work on our trade with China because it's been very tough on our country for very many years.
Trump	1	I said, "What's the word 'reform'?
Trump	1	That means it's no good.
Trump	1	Trump National.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much.
Trump	1	This is not a normal situation.
Trump	1	We're not having them.
Trump	1	We will always stand by, proudly, the heroes -- and they're our heroes on ICE and border patrol and law enforcement and on military.
Trump	1	That's why we should do great when we run in a very short period of time.
Trump	1	She leaked it.
Trump	1	And yes, I agree.
Trump	1	Right, David?
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	People don't want to give them any increase.
Trump	1	If I said this, when I came here often, I came here often.
Trump	1	They don't ask -- they don't ask him.
Trump	1	That's where you pay a tremendous amount of money for the privilege of not having to pay to buy terrible, horrible health care that's way overpriced.
Trump	1	The first time in 14 years that we cracked 3, right?
Trump	1	I know he just spoke.
Trump	1	He deserves overwhelming bipartisan support.
Trump	1	In fact, what we needed somebody over at the RNC, I said get that woman that ran Michigan.
Trump	1	I used to say, Keep the oil.
Trump	1	And I'll tell you what -- I think it's going to be really hard for open-border, crime-infested Democrats to win that guy's vote.
Trump	1	We can't let it happen.
Trump	1	You remember it started off extremely hostile.
Trump	1	We also have employment choice because you never had a chance yet to stay in a job that you hated or you couldn't get a job.
Trump	1	So we signed the tax bill.
Trump	1	They put out these horrible polls and then they hope that everyone's going to say, "Hey, look, I like Trump, but he's got no chance of winning."
Trump	1	And we're going to have a great relationship with China, but we have to be fair to ourselves, also.
Trump	1	We got $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and another $1.6 billion.
Trump	1	Did he get a piece of the deal, I hope?
Trump	1	Crazy Bernie -- he still doesn't know what happened.
Trump	1	I said, "You could do it."
Trump	1	 Wow, what a group.
Trump	1	People said to me...
Trump	1	Jimmy Kimmel would meet me before the election.
Trump	1	We're doing very, very well, and I think you're going to have something very, very, special take place in a short period of time.
Trump	1	So unemployment numbers are among the best in the history of our country.
Trump	1	Like we haven't won before.
Trump	1	He's going to be a great senator, Matt Rosendale.
Trump	1	And President Moon of South Korea gives us the credit.
Trump	1	I said really?
Trump	1	And we will never stop fighting for our country, our freedom and our flag.
Trump	1	I see -- I think, I'm doing it right now.
Trump	1	Going to stay up here.
Trump	1	My friends, your strength and devotion and values are what truly make America great and what make America run.
Trump	1	And didn't quite make it.
Trump	1	ANWR.
Trump	1	She's becoming too popular.
Trump	1	You know, he goes down as the greatest leader, in my opinion, in history.
Trump	1	And we actually have better relationships.
Trump	1	See, with me, they're doing con jobs, too, but at least I'm sort of -- that's been my whole life, I've been -- people are -- I expect like things like this.
Trump	1	We have 900,000 people backlogged.
Trump	1	I want this race to start immediately.
Trump	1	And when did we need it more than now?
Trump	1	You'd better get people out."
Trump	1	And if you elect Republicans this November, we will pass legislation to end catch and release.
Trump	1	They could've kept it in that gorgeous plant at Lordstown.
Trump	1	Unemployment among women is at its lowest level in almost 20 years.
Trump	1	We are pride in our history and respect for our great American flag.
Trump	1	So we can continue this incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country.
Trump	1	No, no.
Trump	1	Where is Steve?
Trump	1	The jobs are coming back.
Trump	1	But we don't want to do that.
Trump	1	For the last two and a half years, we have been under siege, and with the Mueller report we won, and now they want a do over, they want a do over.
Trump	1	They want...
Trump	1	Your dreams and my dreams, your hopes or my hopes and your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day.
Trump	1	Why?
Trump	1	I guarantee I'll be watching it later.
Trump	1	You got to vote.
Trump	1	I kept saying, when I heard the past administration -- I'm being nice.
Trump	1	And we will never forget our military.
Trump	1	We have to stop this from happening.
Trump	1	They want to get rid of these incredible warriors.
Trump	1	"Oh, Canada."
Trump	1	In the end, you know what's going to happen.
Trump	1	And I said, "Do these people ever like wave the flag?
Trump	1	We missed one vote, one vote, one vote.
Trump	1	I really understand now why it was never approved by everybody that ran for office -- every president, both parties in running.
Trump	1	Our great first lady -- I come home, I said, did they show the crowd?
Trump	1	If you want security, if you want a strong border, if you want to have a country that is a great, great, safe country, then you need to go out and you need to vote Republican.
Trump	1	We've got to win.
Trump	1	The fact is the Democrats are lousy politicians.
Trump	1	Oh, really?
Trump	1	So he didn't want the wall.
Trump	1	And in 2018 alone, America added over 150,000 brand new energy jobs.
Trump	1	We protect most.
Trump	1	Already during my time in office, we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent.
Trump	1	Now we did win a great court case last night.
Trump	1	Beautiful.
Trump	1	It's big.
Trump	1	You saw Elon the other day.
Trump	1	They're going to build an incredible campus and lots of other things.
Trump	1	We need people to help, but we want them to come in through the merit system, not a system where we get MS-13 and everybody else that other countries don't want.
Trump	1	John?
Trump	1	And I'm reading tremendous crime, bad education, bad this bad that, not safe, everything better.
Trump	1	And then what happened is there were some protesters in one rally, like two people that live in a basement of their parents' house.
Trump	1	In fact, until just recently, we had a 70-year low coming through.
Trump	1	And my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth ranch of the American armed forces, the Space force.
Trump	1	That's not nice.
Trump	1	It gives them hope.
Trump	1	We are really doing well but we have a problem.
Trump	1	Explain that one.
Trump	1	Democrats believe that everyone in the world has the right to violate our borders.
Trump	1	Great job.
Trump	1	[Applause] For workers without a college degree, these job offer wages that are 32 percent higher than other occupations.
Trump	1	[Laughter] You know who you are?
Trump	1	So we want to thank them.
Trump	1	We have a long way to go with that, but it's going to happen very easily.
Trump	1	But remember -- it is.
Trump	1	That's changing rapidly.
Trump	1	We're going to win at space.
Trump	1	We will never give up our freedom.
Trump	1	And you look at those bad numbers that were there in the last couple of years, it was this way, and going in the wrong direction.
Trump	1	I look so forward to seeing some of those numbers.
Trump	1	And you think that's easy?
Trump	1	That was 44 years they've been trying to pass choice, so that if you have to wait in line for 9 days, 30 days, 21 days, months, you don't do that anymore.
Trump	1	Go under a windmill sometime.
Trump	1	"We need six months."
Trump	1	Nobody asked."
Trump	1	There was a story two days ago, in a major newspaper, talking about people living in Canada, coming into the United States, and smuggling things back into Canada because the tariffs are so massive.
Trump	1	Board Chairman, Dr. Steve Brown.
Trump	1	Beautiful.
Trump	1	We're also restoring American security by rebuilding our military.
Trump	1	Because they don't want to.
Trump	1	He loves this country so much, Congressman Mark Meadows.
Trump	1	I think we got him.
Trump	1	What is it for?
Trump	1	We're building the wall by the way.
Trump	1	You got to vote for Mike Braun.
Trump	1	He's going to win.
Trump	1	Good job.
Trump	1	Can you believe this?
Trump	1	I mean, when you have 15,000 people marching up and you have hundreds and hundreds of people and you have two or three border security, people that are brave and great, and don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons, we can't.
Trump	1	That's National Championship ring.
Trump	1	We're doing the right thing.
Trump	1	Where's Kat?
Trump	1	According to the NFIB's latest survey, the share of small businesses raising worker and benefit pay has just set a new all-time record.
Trump	1	And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again... and we will make America great again.
Trump	1	[Applause] Congress now has the opportunity to build on this momentum, and to act on a common-sense plan that will make our economy stronger, our roads faster and our families safer.
Trump	1	So we now have the hottest economy anywhere on earth.
Trump	1	We won a lawsuit on the wall,.
Trump	1	We opened that stock exchange the next day; people were shocked.
Trump	1	What's going on in Montana?
Trump	1	These were not great competitors, but they were fun.
Trump	1	But these people have led incredible lives.
Trump	1	Congressman Buddy Carter ...
Trump	1	You have to do it.
Trump	1	They made more money in real dollars than they did two years ago, with three jobs, and two jobs, and now, for the first time, they have a choice, our economy so strong.
Trump	1	He then picked it up and he threw it to first.
Trump	1	More than 100 Democrats in Congress never signed up for the Bernie Sanders government takeover of health care, which would eliminate the private health insurance that many of the people in this room have.
Trump	1	He's never called me, because he listens to Schumer.
Trump	1	Can't let that happen.
Trump	1	We protect ICE.
Trump	1	And we weren't taking proper care of them.
Trump	1	We are returning power to where it belongs -- to the American people.
Trump	1	They would have said, What a ridiculous statement.
Trump	1	Great state.
Trump	1	We're not going to be Venezuela -- you see what's happening -- and open our borders to deadly drugs and violent gangs.
Trump	1	It's all worked out.
Trump	1	I told them, that's one thing we can't do.
Trump	1	A little bit different.
Trump	1	I hear you have a very good coach.
Trump	1	Welcome to America.
Trump	1	But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people.
Trump	1	[Applause] We're going to build new airports, and we're going to build railways and highways and waterways all across this magnificent land.
Trump	1	I say, yeah, I'm conservative, but you know what I really -- it's common sense.
Trump	1	Remember?
Trump	1	And the other was that Andy Barr is a great congressman.
Trump	1	We have a military that I just spent - I just got approved $700 billion to fix our military, which has fallen way behind.
Trump	1	Remember that.
Trump	1	And by the way, you obstruct these justices, you're going to lose your Second Amendment.
Trump	1	We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs.
Trump	1	And they vote against him?
Trump	1	Do we love her?
Trump	1	And just remember, with the Democrats, there is no second amendment.
Trump	1	We're going to that.
Trump	1	Here are just some of our achievements since Election Day.
Trump	1	And as you know, Apple announced they're going to spend $350 billion -- not million.
Trump	1	Republicans produce jobs.
Trump	1	Democrat mayor.
Trump	1	And now what happened is they just moved.
Trump	1	And Republicans will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Trump	1	Car companies are pouring in.
Trump	1	[Applause] Your support has been incredible in getting this very difficult legislation to the finish line and passed.
Trump	1	Tell Israel that the wall didn't work.
Trump	1	[Applause] According to a recent Dartmouth study, the sanctuary city of Lawrence, Massachusetts is one of the primary sources of fentanyl in six New Hampshire counties.
Trump	1	So we're doing that and we're spending a lot of money on that.
Trump	1	Otherwise, we'll just wait 'til we win back the House, win the Senate, win the presidency, and we'll vote.
Trump	1	Their lives were cut short, but they and their loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.
Trump	1	So far, there's nobody on the list.
Trump	1	What?
Trump	1	Just like the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem should have been done -- it was promised by many other Presidents.
Trump	1	I'll call him at the strangest hours.
Trump	1	As we see in Jordan, the most compassionate policy is to place refugees as close to their homes as possible to ease their eventual return to be part of the rebuilding process.
Trump	1	Wait until you see the news tomorrow on something.
Trump	1	We got to get Tim in there.
Trump	1	Who knows?
Trump	1	And that's been going on for 52 years and many American presidents said we will do that, they never did it, they never did it.
Trump	1	We've had a big impact.
Trump	1	We took over.
Trump	1	What is that?
Trump	1	And they have to wait so long they've been literally terminally ill by the time they got doctor's care.
Trump	1	That's what I did.
Trump	1	It's the Tiffany location.
Trump	1	You have a lot of two-termers and in less than two years -- and I happen to believe that that was as important and maybe even more important than the largest tax cut in the history of our country.
Trump	1	We just gave over millions of acres of great space, public space to Utah.
Trump	1	Headlines, Donald Trump called women beautiful.
Trump	1	These are human traffickers.
Trump	1	But I have more than she has.
Trump	1	Our fallen warriors are finally coming home to lay at rest in American soil.
Trump	1	We've never had a movement like this.
Trump	1	Well, we have a country to run.
Trump	1	That's the hundred -- I think its 103 times since I'm President that we've hit a new high.
Trump	1	They were taking over Yemen.
Trump	1	We're helping our farmers a lot.
Trump	1	So we checked, 300 people.
Trump	1	Very important.
Trump	1	She should be where she is.
Trump	1	We're being -- we're being tough, but we have no choice.
Trump	1	We lost $151 billion with the European Union.
Trump	1	He loves the state.
Trump	1	And I don't think you want that.
Trump	1	But despite all of this, just came out, 94 percent of the press I get is negative.
Trump	1	You can ask Jim Jordan.
Trump	1	Don?
Trump	1	Come.
Trump	1	It's my great honor to be before you.
Trump	1	Here's another one they couldn't get passed for decades, VA accountability.
Trump	1	And you know what?
Trump	1	No, no.
Trump	1	You know, Japan, the market was totally closed, we just opened it.
Trump	1	It's a little tricky, but that’s okay.
Trump	1	I said at the United Nations, "We're putting America first.
Trump	1	Because they want a strong border, they want it because they understand the border better than anybody.
Trump	1	They'll be in jail or we're bringing them back where they come from.
Trump	1	You got a chance to put Mike Braun there, smart, tough.
Trump	1	And, hopefully, we'll be able to when we're down the road.
Trump	1	As a result of our historic economic boom also, we are lifting up all Americans from all walks of life, including those who have endured the pain of addiction.
Trump	1	[Audience Responds No] I don't think so.
Trump	1	But -- but he's going to win this race so easily.
Trump	1	[Applause] Keep America Great.
Trump	1	Everyone wants it.
Trump	1	Whoever thought, right?
Trump	1	Is it treason?
Trump	1	Also joining us is Tim Armstead, who is running as you know for Supreme Court.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Every one.
Trump	1	So these countries that are sending people in -- do you think they are sending us their finest?
Trump	1	Thank you very much, Richard.
Trump	1	We have turned this big, beautiful, mighty ship.
Trump	1	"Six of them extensions.
Trump	1	I'm telling you, right, John?
Trump	1	Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.
Trump	1	[Booing] But we're not going to let that happen.
Trump	1	And the pilot says, "Sir, we're landing in approximately one and a half minutes."
Trump	1	In fact, I looked at John Kennedy, when I signed that.
Trump	1	That's too bad.
Trump	1	When the car stopped, two gunmen began shooting at Trooper Dawson, and shooting very violently.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	I didn't get corrected, then again, 60,000, then after four or five times, I realized that they agree that we lost 60,000.
Trump	1	He will never ever disappoint you.
Trump	1	They're dumping it all over our country.
Trump	1	Millions of people would have been -- and yes, I came in and took a very hard position, very hard position.
Trump	1	Weakness.
Trump	1	Little pencil-neck Adam Schiff.
Trump	1	This epidemic can affect anyone, and that's why we want to educate everyone.
Trump	1	[Applause] And really all over the world.
Trump	1	Ron stands 100 percent with the men and women of law enforcement like we all do.
Trump	1	And that's what he'd do with our country.
Trump	1	Honestly, sir, they can't stand it anymore.
Trump	1	All of them, law enforcement offices.
Trump	1	No, no, when you see the Times, how dishonest they are, when you see the Washington Post, how totally dishonest -- when we leave -- and I actually say this: they are all doing numbers that they've, like, never done.
Trump	1	That's what we're doing: We're making a lot of people wealthy.
Trump	1	And it's also about prosperity.
Trump	1	Four cuts.
Trump	1	My guys could have set it up a little bit better.
Trump	1	And there are some people that are running right now; I don't think they have that number one on their list.
Trump	1	We had over 100,000 people that wanted to come.
Trump	1	They can hop in the ship themselves.
Trump	1	They're draining us.
Trump	1	[Laughter] May take a while.
Trump	1	So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, "Sir, it doesn’t matter.
Trump	1	Great job, sonny.
Trump	1	We have to do it.
Trump	1	They will turn it around, make it bad so fast getting money for the military was so tough, and to do that, we had to give them money for things that we don't want.
Trump	1	But I heard this morning, "President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report."
Trump	1	Let's rip down every building in New York City and rebuild it environmentally slightly better.
Trump	1	It's incredible.
Trump	1	And we need law enforcement, and we need ICE and we need border patrol.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Even with the worst laws -- they are the worst laws.
Trump	1	And then it came time to vote, and as you know we got the vote.
Trump	1	Democrats want to raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, turn us into a Venezuela...
Trump	1	And I haven't been able to do it, but it's happening soon.
Trump	1	Look at that chart.
Trump	1	We slashed taxes for working families, most of them in half, and saved our family farms and our small businesses by eliminating the estate tax in almost all cases.
Trump	1	And it's one of the things that's making our country tick, that regulation cutting.
Trump	1	But I said, "Richard -- Richard, call me 'Donald', like you always do.
Trump	1	Were they succeeding?
Trump	1	I did a lot of stops, I saw a lot of people.
Trump	1	How are we doing in Venezuela, step by step?
Trump	1	I spoke to people that have been here a long time they said, "When that wall went up, it's a whole different ball game."
Trump	1	$1 billion under budget.
Trump	1	They took our dignity.
Trump	1	That's a tremendous number of additional crime.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	He's a warrior.
Trump	1	Fake news.
Trump	1	Can you imagine?
Trump	1	[Laughter] Almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since my election, 3.9.
Trump	1	We just had it approved by the United States Supreme Court.
Trump	1	That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we don't want.
Trump	1	Within two years, by the end of my term, if you had a normal president, I don't want to say that negatively, I think I'm very normal, but if you had a normal -- you know what I mean.
Trump	1	So remember what I told you.
Trump	1	He's a bad guy.
Trump	1	We would have gotten away with it.
Trump	1	Stand up, Kevin, please.
Trump	1	So now they can send it but, if they get caught, they're going to get the death penalty.
Trump	1	[Audience Calls We Love You] And this is your record crowd, you know, all time record crowd.
Trump	1	So happy anniversary.
Trump	1	And I don't believe the three.
Trump	1	And, if I don't, Sonny teaches me.
Trump	1	We're going to take away your farms.
Trump	1	And we're getting these gangs like MS-13 and others, we get them the hell out of the country one by one getting them out.
Trump	1	Don't do it.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	And I said to my people, Here's the bad news.
Trump	1	I have -- I have to tell you, he went to this college and Brad Parscale is here, the world's tallest campaign manager in the history of the world.
Trump	1	He's voting against your tax cuts.
Trump	1	Because he has done an incredible job.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	Just look.
Trump	1	We have to go through Congress.
Trump	1	West Virginia is back a lot faster than even I thought it could happen.
Trump	1	And look how you turned out.
Trump	1	So now somebody's terminally ill. And if we have a drug that looks like it's possibly going to help, we can actually give it to those people.
Trump	1	And I said, I don't understand how you can't pass tax cuts.
Trump	1	So, it sounds wonderful, our country lost 151 billion.
Trump	1	And I said I was going to bring the jobs back.
Trump	1	It's like a new age.
Trump	1	We'll see you soon.
Trump	1	And they're asking me questions about politics.
Trump	1	We put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance.
Trump	1	I don't think so."
Trump	1	Think of what that is -- 20,000.
Trump	1	Oh, really, how are we getting to Hawaii on a train?
Trump	1	So I appreciate you all -- this is a big crowd.
Trump	1	We're building the wall, not only building it, we've already started it.
Trump	1	It's including those charged or convicted of approximately 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes, and 1,800 murders.
Trump	1	They resist and they stick together.
Trump	1	I can smell a contractor, believe it or not.
Trump	1	We're not going to lose, right?
Trump	1	And Abraham Lincoln came home, he said, I can't beat Robert E. Lee.
Trump	1	I'm decreasing the prices.
Trump	1	By the way, they shoot -- it's not like, Oh, gee, I committed a terrible thing.
Trump	1	They're coming back to Michigan.
Trump	1	We have dreams.
Trump	1	$300 billion came back, money that would have never been able to come back into our country.
Trump	1	Missouri.
Trump	1	Do you notice the good location they got?
Trump	1	 Thank you.
Trump	1	And I said, "Why didn't my other generals tell me that?
Trump	1	How about that, right?
Trump	1	Can you believe that?
Trump	1	And we're just getting started.
Trump	1	And I'll tell you, folks, I worked hard.
Trump	1	He is leading by, like, 60 points.
Trump	1	Now Justice Kavanaugh, then Judge Kavanaugh, great person.
Trump	1	I know the people of Arizona, you don't want -- you don't want it.
Trump	1	So we just get that done, farmers, ranchers, growers.
Trump	1	Get out and vote or early voting.
Trump	1	Thank you, Troy.
Trump	1	I said to Raisin Cane and the other generals, "Generals, how long can it take?"
Trump	1	Nobody ever heard me say we're going to -- almost four million jobs -- four million.
Trump	1	It'll be Trump calls women beautiful.
Trump	1	Same for Asian Americans, lowest unemployment rate ever recorded.
Trump	1	See, now I can't get sued.
Trump	1	There's nobody that's not ripping us off" In fact, I thought I found a country, very small, located in South America and I said, "You know, I think we made actually a better deal with the cut."
Trump	1	This is a man that loves the people of Montana, loves the people of this country.
Trump	1	I said, "Ron, you're at three.
Trump	1	I said, You got it.
Trump	1	He called me before I was running.
Trump	1	And part of the reason we're doing that, and very important for us, is we have built and are in the process of building by far the strongest military that we've ever had.
Trump	1	We have to end our lottery system, and we have to end chain migration.
Trump	1	Sixty thousand, who would believe that number?
Trump	1	His wife stopped him, "Darling, that would be inappropriate."
Trump	1	At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the Space Force.
Trump	1	So if anybody wants to leave, we'll save your place.
Trump	1	He came in, and then he took chain migration, and he brought his mother, and his father, and his brother, and his sister, and his aunt, and his grandfather.
Trump	1	And I said, "That's going to be one of the most important."
Trump	1	I'm not -- why do you mention it to me?
Trump	1	He doesn't stop.
Trump	1	They're for resisting.
Trump	1	These people are sick, they're crazy, they're crazy, so always keep your eyes open, be careful, and let law enforcement know when you see a kook, let them know because we have the greatest law enforcement on Earth.
Trump	1	And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division, and destruction.
Trump	1	Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis for one simple reason because they have cause the border crisis and you know why else?
Trump	1	Gotten to know her very well over the last number of months.
Trump	1	That because of the fact that we are, today, getting this great, great, talented, wonderful Supreme Court judge.
Trump	1	Thank you, Lindsey.
Trump	1	So important.
Trump	1	He's a hunter.
Trump	1	Everybody said it could not be done.
Trump	1	Good everything?
Trump	1	There's some bad people, as I said the other -- bad hombres.
Trump	1	We passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor, rather than waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks.
Trump	1	As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing beyond our reach.
Trump	1	The -- I love you, too.
Trump	1	You saw that, good I hope you saw that.
Trump	1	They want to see us be a great, respected country.
Trump	1	Doing a great job.
Trump	1	And we are just getting started.
Trump	1	We just got to a big pay raise for the first time in 10 years.
Trump	1	Twenty five.
Trump	1	We're over $3 billion.
Trump	1	What we're proposing includes humanitarian assistance, drug detection at our ports and everywhere else, closing legal loopholes, which is a big problem, and plans for a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier or wall, let's call it a wall, it's better.
Trump	1	So I said, Let's stop building the wall.
Trump	1	Josh is running against an extreme liberal Democrat named Claire McCaskill.
Trump	1	Veterans' choice.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Every single Democrat in Congress opposed our middle class tax cuts.
Trump	1	They know what they're doing.
Trump	1	The most unpopular president.
Trump	1	That was a different kind.
Trump	1	Manufacturing confidence just announced has reached an all-time high.
Trump	1	That's great.
Trump	1	We stand ready to help Texas respond to the storms that are continuing to cause flooding throughout the region.
Trump	1	No, they're not.
Trump	1	But I will say, there is an electricity in the air the likes of which I and you have not seen since the '16 election.
Trump	1	We're going to watch those vote tallies.
Trump	1	And we shoot down rockets that are shot from North Korea to South Korea to shoot down -- OK, so we're protecting South Korea, right?
Trump	1	You think you're a lot of people?
Trump	1	Historically, 3.2%, crushing expectations, a lot of surprise people, I wasn't surprised.
Trump	1	And he is.
Trump	1	From now, until November 3rd, 2020, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning.
Trump	1	A magic wand.
Trump	1	We need Josh, but we need more Republicans.
Trump	1	 Oh, we had such luck in Orlando, we love being in Orlando.
Trump	1	Where is Thom?
Trump	1	We'll never fail.
Trump	1	[Laughter] So Sean's been fantastic.
Trump	1	Can you believe that?
Trump	1	I'm gonna show you something someday soon.
Trump	1	But they don't show the crowds.
Trump	1	And they walked up to my desk about three months ago, right after I did it.
Trump	1	All action.
Trump	1	And we are also the party of jobs, jobs, jobs.
Trump	1	They said that's not her name, sir.
Trump	1	But they're not doing so well, folks.
Trump	1	Through the centuries, the Jews have endured terrible persecution, and you know that.
Trump	1	We kicked in immediately.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And what do I read?
Trump	1	So it's a whole different world, but our steel industry is booming.
Trump	1	She will always vote for your Wisconsin values.
Trump	1	Because I don't want to use it.
Trump	1	And I mentioned the word rape.
Trump	1	I know he's saying wonderful things now about me, and he might be a nice guy, except he tried to destroy Admiral Ronny Jackson... who didn't do -- who's the most clean-cut, wonderful person that you've ever met.
Trump	1	When we're strong, we're going to have peace.
Trump	1	I wanted a full report.
Trump	1	We'll bring it at a federal level.
Trump	1	So the very same establishment that sacrificed our prosperity, weakened our military, and tied us down through endless wars that never ended folks, they never ended.
Trump	1	It's always dangerous.
Trump	1	These are brave and great men and women.
Trump	1	There was nothing -- they had no hope.
Trump	1	In all fairness, other administrations did nothing.
Trump	1	What a smart -- what a tough team this is.
Trump	1	Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by left-wing haters, angry mobs, socialist fanatics, deep-state bureaucrats, and their fake news allies.
Trump	1	But we can't have wealthy, wealthy countries where we take care of their military and we're not reimbursed, or we're reimbursed for a tiny fraction.
Trump	1	Thank you, Jason.
Trump	1	We're doing that.
Trump	1	It's in the form of a very tough fence.
Trump	1	I said, "How much do they pay?"
Trump	1	All over the -- all over Syria and Iraq.
Trump	1	Absolutely.
Trump	1	We're gonna have the h2 bees come in.
Trump	1	And he had this beautiful speech written down in his iPhone -- this is the new way of doing it -- [Laughter] -- and he never looked at it once.
Trump	1	We don't want any help.
Trump	1	And John helped so much.
Trump	1	And from the plains of our heartland to the peaks of the West, the future farmers of America will lift our nation to new heights.
Trump	1	[Applause] And on terrorism, in Iraq and Syria, we've taken back almost 100 percent, in a very short period of time, of the land that they took.
Trump	1	How about that?
Trump	1	I said, you've got to be kidding, and we've all done a good job together, Rob, it's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody, it's been amazing.
Trump	1	Not a problem in his whole life.
Trump	1	Choice.
Trump	1	I was getting a call from everyone.
Trump	1	And, you know, they call them developing nations.
Trump	1	It looks like the Academy Awards there's so many.
Trump	1	They will be better.
Trump	1	I'll tell you.
Trump	1	If you want strong borders and safe communities, vote Republican.
Trump	1	But not only for African-Americans, for Asian, for Hispanic.
Trump	1	Herndon Police Sergeant Claudio Saa.
Trump	1	We can do it.
Trump	1	You didn't think you'd hear that, right?
Trump	1	We're having a talk on trade.
Trump	1	The radical democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets, sanctuary cities.
Trump	1	And it's about time.
Trump	1	Last year was your record, and I was here too.
Trump	1	It's all taxes and taxes and taxes.
Trump	1	We've also just identified the first remains of our fallen warriors from North Korea, these incredible heroes, to now lay at rest in American soil.
Trump	1	I'm so honored to have had this kind of a turnout, this kind of a record.
Trump	1	How about the kid?
Trump	1	To restore our security we increased defense spending to $700 billion this year and $716 billion next year.
Trump	1	We only have about a thousand left.
Trump	1	She said it never happened.
Trump	1	Well we found the magic wand and that's actually -- - - that's actually going to be increasing by a lot in the next short while because we have a lot of companies moving in.
Trump	1	No, I just looked at the screen, and I said to my people, "How many people are here?"
Trump	1	And we're not going to.
Trump	1	I've never had a call.
Trump	1	You've been doing that too long to our poor Presidents that had no clue what was happening.
Trump	1	No, but I'd get it down to 4 or 5; that's not so bad.
Trump	1	We've brought it back.
Trump	1	We’ve started the construction of a major border wall, and we have greatly strengthened border security.
Trump	1	And that was dead.
Trump	1	A few weeks ago, we achieved that historic victory for our Constitution and for the rule of law.
Trump	1	Thank you, Phil.
Trump	1	They're great people.
Trump	1	That's what they say.
Trump	1	It's very simple.
Trump	1	Oh, I see.
Trump	1	He stared down the angry left-wing mob.
Trump	1	That's why Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare and free health care.
Trump	1	Reciprocal.
Trump	1	And then we had a surprise but not a surprise to us, because we're bringing back the auto industry, brought so much back to the great state of Michigan, that was a shocker, remember that?
Trump	1	I have wealthy friends they say, "Write out $1 trillion."
Trump	1	We have rebuilt China.
Trump	1	Without a question, without a doubt, we will make America wealthy again.
Trump	1	[Laughter] You know why?
Trump	1	It's true.
Trump	1	[Laughter] But I haven't seen anyone leaving.
Trump	1	But it was going in the wrong direction, and now we are turning it around.
Trump	1	Okay, I understand But you know, if you don't want our agricultural product, we don't want your cars.
Trump	1	That's stronger.
Trump	1	He announces he wants open borders, that means just pour in, and then he wants to give them health care, education, everything.
Trump	1	And I asked one of the Coast Guard guys, I said, so let me ask you a question.
Trump	1	Because you know that, without them, you couldn't do it.
Trump	1	African American and Hispanic American poverty are at an all-time low.
Trump	1	So the farmers are so incredible -- and I saw them interviewed last week.
Trump	1	So, we're so happy for your family, and I know your sons are going to make you very proud.
Trump	1	Where's Mark Meadows?
Trump	1	We're rebuilding our military like never before, $700 billion.
Trump	1	The illegals -- and by the way, I hate to tell you, you go to California, you go -- they vote anyway.
Trump	1	"Uh, well, it could be better"?
Trump	1	Will you get that done for me, please.
Trump	1	How do you do it?
Trump	1	Not going to happen.
Trump	1	The President Gerald Ford.
Trump	1	In fact, I'm going there with the delegation.
Trump	1	Mike Pence went to Hawaii.
Trump	1	And God bless America.
Trump	1	Where do I get a charge, darling?
Trump	1	They want to raise your taxes.
Trump	1	Yeah.
Trump	1	So we're going to be taking some very tough actions.
Trump	1	You now have no estate tax to pay.
Trump	1	So I haven't given.
Trump	1	They wanted me to have a boxing match on this stage.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Because our Congress can't act.
Trump	1	We have an election coming up that if something bad should happen with this election we could lose the country, we really could, because these people are stone cold crazy.
Trump	1	And they're terminal, and they're not going to be living much longer.
Trump	1	They could steal.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	They basically want to impose socialism in the United States.
Trump	1	They treated him badly.
Trump	1	And now we have 20 coming up, who would believe November 3rd, not November 8th, it's November 3rd, and it's going to be just as special as November 8th.
Trump	1	They're not dumping so much anymore.
Trump	1	Do we keep our logo?
Trump	1	I want to deal with the people in the union, not the heads of the union."
Trump	1	We make missiles that can knock missiles out of the air from thousands of miles away.
Trump	1	Reclaim our proud and righteous destiny as Americans.
Trump	1	American patriots defeated fascism, vanquished communism, delivered millions into freedom, and Americans built the greatest country and the most powerful military in the history of the world.
Trump	1	We have massive sanctions, but I want to take them off quickly.
Trump	1	Thank you, Mexico.
Trump	1	You know, if you have a strong military, you're never going to have to use it.
Trump	1	OK?
Trump	1	We want to stop drugs.
Trump	1	The radical Democrats are also pushing for a thing called -- If you can believe this, open borders.
Trump	1	And there was no way legally you could do it to help somebody who was terminally ill.
Trump	1	Can you imagine?
Trump	1	A vote for Wacky Jacky is a vote for the extreme agenda of those people, as Pelosi-Schumer-Waters is a vote for more taxes.
Trump	1	That's not the name.
Trump	1	They loved their God is right.
Trump	1	And together we will make America wealthy again.
Trump	1	He went into a meeting and he said, "We're going to look into his finances."
Trump	1	He voted no on cutting the estate tax or the death tax for your farms, your farmers, and your small businesses.
Trump	1	"Oh, I see.
Trump	1	He actually said I was healthy.
Trump	1	I said we're closing the border and as soon as I said that, and I really thank the president of Mexico because they stepped up and now they are apprehending people on their southern border.
Trump	1	The whole world is richer, humanity is better, because of this beautiful constellation of nations, each very special, each very unique, and each shining brightly in its part of the world.
Trump	1	I think -- do we like him more than Trump?
Trump	1	What do you have to lose?"
Trump	1	This is a state that is going to be with us and has always been with us, and we love -- and we love the people.
Trump	1	It should have been terminated on day two.
Trump	1	After the industry dies -- would have died within two years.
Trump	1	I put it on social media, because I'm being nice.
Trump	1	Get out and vote for him, anyway.
Trump	1	You'd be great.
Trump	1	He's been here with us.
Trump	1	"Keep America Great.
Trump	1	And the one thing about a fighter or a nation or whatever you want, the stronger your military, the better chance you have of never having to use it.
Trump	1	And you're inside and I'm inside and we love each other and it's going to stay that way.
Trump	1	"What neighborhood was it in?"
Trump	1	We will never surrender.
Trump	1	Remember the leaking, right?
Trump	1	Other than that, we're not doing very well.
Trump	1	It's very simple, putting America first.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	Democrats produce mobs.
Trump	1	Maybe we'll do it and if we don't we're going to be in even better position, you understand that.
Trump	1	The United States is committed to making the United Nations more effective and accountable.
Trump	1	Did you see Jimmy Fallon?
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	She's got a lot of energy.
Trump	1	Eight?
Trump	1	We cannot allow a regime that chants “Death to America,” and that threatens Israel with annihilation, to possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on Earth.
Trump	1	I thought he was a great war hero.
Trump	1	Made it a good deal.
Trump	1	Get your ass out to vote.
Trump	1	I'm going to go Iowa first, then I'm going to go Nebraska.
Trump	1	And we were all crying, too, out of happiness, right?
Trump	1	[Laughter] Come on.
Trump	1	Get out and vote.
Trump	1	The language of moral condemnation and destructive routine, these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration.
Trump	1	He makes tractor grapples, mounting plates, and other agricultural equipment.
Trump	1	You know why we love it?
Trump	1	[Laughter] And I'm up 49 percent.
Trump	1	They're going to destroy it.
Trump	1	But I said, you know, Bobby, I haven't decided to run.
Trump	1	It's horrible.
Trump	1	Something I am so proud of -- I love it.
Trump	1	People come from many countries.
Trump	1	$50 million.
Trump	1	But it's not a big thing, you know, so many people are losing, they love their kids and they want to leave their farm, their ranch, their business.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	And I told my people yesterday, our country's full, we're full.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	Well, I don't know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I'm in favor of the plan."
Trump	1	Women are smart, and they want security.
Trump	1	I don't blame China.
Trump	1	No.
Trump	1	It's always nicer than somebody loses.
Trump	1	[Laughter] But the ones who don't, don't listen to me, because this won't matter, because you're not going to leave it anyway.
Trump	1	And it's hot.
Trump	1	"Baby, what I did with North Korea was great.
Trump	1	Since the election we've added six million jobs, including a half a million manufacturing jobs.
Trump	1	And it was about us.
Trump	1	They're all saying "Merry Christmas" now.
Trump	1	[Laughter] But now what's happened has been crazy when you look at it.
Trump	1	And we'll get that stopped.
Trump	1	I said, "You got to get those forests."
Trump	1	Nobody.
Trump	1	She's going to be back very soon.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	We're getting another one -- we want to build it all at one time.
Trump	1	What do you have to lose?
Trump	1	But we're going to try getting it down even quicker.
Trump	1	Our future has never looked brighter and that's because of the hardworking Americans like you and millions of small-business owners who took the chance to do what they love: to follow their hearts and to chase their very beautiful dreams.
Trump	1	They're gone, boom, we fire them.
Trump	1	They've been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades.
Trump	1	You have private health care 180 million people they want to take it away from you.
Trump	1	We are putting our steelworkers back to work.
Trump	1	Oh, so this is very much a Tuesday state.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Thank you, Zippy.
Trump	1	I'm here to see you but I'll be seeing a lot of you over the next year.
Trump	1	Our economy is doing great, OK?
Trump	1	That was under your great President Obama.
Trump	1	I'm going to try and get you subsidy."
Trump	1	I don't know, Mike.
Trump	1	The health care takeover, who is the lead sponsor?
Trump	1	Look at it.
Trump	1	You know we fight for borders, but we -- hey, by the way, see the signs?
Trump	1	We can't do this."
Trump	1	But, listen to this.
Trump	1	And that's what makes me happy.
Trump	1	Well, they were suffering that night.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Just this week, we learned that Iowa authorities have changed an illegal alien in the murder of -- and they charged an illegal alien in the murder of a college student, Mollie Tibbetts.
Trump	1	That's a big statement.
Trump	1	And it's true.
Trump	1	And it is.
Trump	1	It's like day and night.
Trump	1	We have to work on that very, very strongly.
Trump	1	I sort of love it, right?
Trump	1	Made in the USA.
Trump	1	This barrier will stop illegal activity, while directing lawful trade, travel, and commerce to our ports of entry.
Trump	1	Again, between the trade deals, world, and our immigration horrible laws in the world, but we're getting them out.
Trump	1	Thank you, Wisconsin.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	We need Republicans to get out and put Republicans in.
Trump	1	Very importantly -- I want to recognize our law enforcement partners from around the world who have traveled here to share their experiences and to strengthen the vital cooperation that we all practice together.
Trump	1	I tell you, you deserve a big "happy."
Trump	1	They're so incredible.
Trump	1	And Tennessee, together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.
Trump	1	But if you need it, you can have the best in the world without having to go around.
Trump	1	But I do -- I want to thank the president.
Trump	1	You all remember those days?
Trump	1	They said well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued.
Trump	1	It wasn't.
Trump	1	They're fake news.
Trump	1	We've given them so much.
Trump	1	So at a minimum, countries in negotiating with us very seriously because of the fact that they don't want to have to pay to come in and take advantage of our country, that's at a minimum.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	 Wow, that is so beautiful.
Trump	1	And these people helped me.
Trump	1	I told you about the record number in history of regulations, that's such a big deal.
Trump	1	She has no Indian blood.
Trump	1	And then we're going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay?
Trump	1	Good job.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much, everybody.
Trump	1	No problem.
Trump	1	So you beat two dynasties, you beat all these politicians.
Trump	1	They paid for it.
Trump	1	You know the right to try is?
Trump	1	That was even before your time.
Trump	1	I said, "Joe, do it before we have the vote.
Trump	1	You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless.
Trump	1	And that was a great honor for you folks.
Trump	1	And Gillum is weak on corruption.
Trump	1	And another part, so important for Ohio, because I know you have a -- a bigger problem than most, is opioids and drugs.
Trump	1	That's what they want because the people of West Virginia never give up.
Trump	1	Because if they don't put it up, it's a tremendous opportunity -- probably something like you won't see again.
Trump	1	Remember that, please.
Trump	1	I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year.
Trump	1	We need safety.
Trump	1	The job you do is really incredible.
Trump	1	But it's "Keep America Great!"
Trump	1	Ohio Supreme Court Justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French, thank you.
Trump	1	I didn't want there to be two people center, right?
Trump	1	They never did it.
Trump	1	It's horrible.
Trump	1	You did so well.
Trump	1	That was at the stadium, right?
Trump	1	Fly right in, folks.
Trump	1	So, they have -- listen, they have -- so I said, What kind of a deal is that?
Trump	1	It wasn't his thing.
Trump	1	[Applause] And we hope we never have to use it.
Trump	1	They had plants that went a mile and a half long and they were using little corners of plants.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	You need to hide, you need to hide.
Trump	1	They never do, unless there's a little problem in which case that camera bends in 15 different directions.
Trump	1	And they always have; not the father but the son, yes.
Trump	1	Throughout our history, America's farmers have always been there to keep our country strong and independent and free.
Trump	1	 One of the most important decisions a President will ever make is the decision to nominate a Justice to the United States Supreme Court.
Trump	1	You're doing us a favor.
Trump	1	Things are changing, folks.
Trump	1	When we buy a car from them, and we buy a lot of them, believe it or not, it's a 40 percent tax.
Trump	1	What he's been through and where we are now because the hottest industry there's right now is the steel industry, and it was dead as a doornail.
Trump	1	Look at him.
Trump	1	I said, "What?"
Trump	1	Now that we have done so, the nations of the region must step up and take more responsibility for their future.
Trump	1	Big thing.
Trump	1	Who said that?
Trump	1	So Robert E. Lee was a great general.
Trump	1	Hasn't been lost.
Trump	1	They're cuckoo.
Trump	1	There's no reason to have lost it.
Trump	1	Let's see, I'm using those lights to read this but we -- I put down all of these things just yesterday I had it made up.
Trump	1	The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years.
Trump	1	I mean, look at Alaska.
Trump	1	Tester joined... Tester joined every other Senate Democrat in supporting open-border legislation from the now-legendary Dianne Feinstein.
Trump	1	You don't back down.
Trump	1	Ours is make America great again.
Trump	1	When the fake news -- they meant it to be bad.
Trump	1	It's a great word.
Trump	1	They're against so many things that you want.
Trump	1	And Linda has been a real star.
Trump	1	So now I say, we've made America great again, but how do you give up the No.
Trump	1	[Laughter] And some people said, "That won't happen."
Trump	1	So I said, "We have to negotiate."
Trump	1	If I would have said 4.1 percent GDP, they would have -- it would have been major headlines like -- and by the way, it's going a lot higher.
Trump	1	Can somebody not care about our military?
Trump	1	We need more Republicans to get the votes.
Trump	1	They like using knives because it's more painful.
Trump	1	I said, you know, if we have about three or four empty seats, the fake news will say, Headlines: "He didn't fill up the arena", so I said, maybe we shouldn't take a chance.
Trump	1	Where is he?
Trump	1	We are doing better now with jobs.
Trump	1	But jobs there, I don't even think about because we need a strong military especially in these times.
Trump	1	They want to demolish our Constitution, weaken our military, eliminate the values that built this magnificent country.
Trump	1	So I have a few people that are right out here, and they're very special.
Trump	1	She is some fighter.
Trump	1	Where is Tate?
Trump	1	You see the meanness, the nastiness.
Trump	1	Republicans are fighting and delivering every day for the African American community, and they know it.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	This is not bad, right?
Trump	1	He headed up the New York Stock Exchange on September 11th.
Trump	1	It's so shaded with what we did.
Trump	1	To take -- the vote took about 15 seconds, right?
Trump	1	That was beautiful.
Trump	1	No, I'm sorry, Nancy.
Trump	1	He -- listen.
Trump	1	One thing I wanted was, I don't want any incentives to get companies to leave our country; fire everybody; move to Mexico, or Canada, or someplace, and build cars and send them in -- no tax, no nothing; and, in the meantime, we end up with nothing except unemployed people.
Trump	1	And in all fairness, that's already happened.
Trump	1	But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God.
Trump	1	The answer is yes.
Trump	1	It doesn't work.
Trump	1	The Georgetown Mill in South Carolina is finally reopening after four and a half years.Donald Trump Big River Steel is investing billions of dollars to build a brand-new plant in Texas and to upgrade another one in Arkansas.
Trump	1	And he said, "You're going to have to appoint somebody."
Trump	1	Beautiful.
Trump	1	But I will tell you within a short period of time that 65 year period will be history, it will be actually history in two ways.
Trump	1	If you don't like your kids, or if you don't love your kids, it doesn't have any impact on you.
Trump	1	They want to turn America into Venezuela.
Trump	1	So we believe in unlocking our nation's resources, empowering our country's workers, and bringing back our wealth.
Trump	1	That's the big thing that the worst part of it.
Trump	1	We want crystal clean water.
Trump	1	Can you believe this?
Trump	1	We will make America strong again.
Trump	1	And this year will be more than that.
Trump	1	Will hopefully be our next senator from the great, great, great state of Tennessee.
Trump	1	Never lower in the history of our country.
Trump	1	They've been trying for 44 years.
Trump	1	Did you ever hear that one?
Trump	1	And four years seemed so long away.
Trump	1	He was an 11-year veteran of the force, and he leaves behind a great wife and two young, beautiful children.
Trump	1	You cannot ever allow a statement.
Trump	1	She's conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement.
Trump	1	You know every foreign leader that comes to see me in the White House, which I see a lot but every foreign lead -- and I see a lot because usually they're treating us unfairly with military, meaning, we're paying for their military and I'm saying.
Trump	1	Thank you, Doctor.
Trump	1	I mean, you think of that: Five million people off of food stamps.
Trump	1	You could have a pond -- a little pond -- and they consider it a lake.
Trump	1	I hear great things.
Trump	1	They got to rip that down.
Trump	1	[Laughter] They are -- they're wild.
Trump	1	I think the leadership is getting it.
Trump	1	And then they said -- remember, for months before the election, you cannot win without getting the great state of Ohio.
Trump	1	Forget about nuclear.
Trump	1	But he was trying to make a point.
Trump	1	Kevin.
Trump	1	It's about your family, your future and the fate of your country.
Trump	1	And we approved them both immediately, and you would have been stuck.
Trump	1	You look at the false charges.
Trump	1	We got our hostages.
Trump	1	He was calling Bush -- President Bush -- all the time: "Get into the Middle East.
Trump	1	And we'll never ever get a vote from Claire McCaskill, and she's been saying very nice things.
Trump	1	That's why Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare, free health care, and free education.
Trump	1	They don't want the wall.
Trump	1	They didn't know what growth was because frankly ... [Laughter] ...you know, Hillary talked about growth and should make a deal like she made with -- with South Korea.
Trump	1	I want to thank the VFW for your devotion to our fallen heroes, unknown soldiers, prisoners of war, and those missing in action, and their families.
Trump	1	And remember they said, oh, but he won't do well with women.
Trump	1	My wife said, I love watching him on television.
Trump	1	They're all aiming at anybody that likes me.
Trump	1	You've got to be."
Trump	1	I said, "How much does it cost?"
Trump	1	We have so many people running.
Trump	1	And that bill has been sitting for a long time over there, Bob, hasn't it?
Trump	1	We charge them a tariff of two and a half percent and by the way -- and they don't pay it, so we get two and a half percent and they get 25% other than that.
Trump	1	But the press said I treated them badly.
Trump	1	Something's going on.
Trump	1	But if Democrats take control, they will try to reverse our amazing progress and plunge our country into gridlock, frankly, into poverty, ultimately into chaos.
Trump	1	[Applause] And don't forget: What it means is it means jobs.
Trump	1	We're reducing the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients access life-saving treatment we passed.
Trump	1	He's a terrific man and a terrific governor, Matt Bevin.
Trump	1	OK?
Trump	1	Thank you, fellas.
Trump	1	I got them both passed.
Trump	1	If you want to uphold our laws, our borders, and our way of life, you need to vote for Ted Budd and for Mark Harris.
Trump	1	But you're not being treated badly anymore.
Trump	1	we will always fight on to victory, because we are Americans.
Trump	1	We're trying to get it down to one.
Trump	1	I can't tell you how much they help me get this stuff done.
Trump	1	Last year, we exported a record-breaking 1.7 billion gallons of ethanol -- that's a big number -- and, separately, the United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on the planet.
Trump	1	We’re very proud of you.
Trump	1	They don't mind.
Trump	1	"Wait a minute.
Trump	1	But a woman who's, a special woman and right -- and her father, by the way, he's out there fighting for us all the time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Trump	1	These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to tear down their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage, right?
Trump	1	It is.
Trump	1	Just out of -- What's the number?
Trump	1	Must be the carbon footprint.
Trump	1	In Ohio recently there was -- he was up and then he went down a little bit.
Trump	1	We love what we are and what we do more than anything else.
Trump	1	No matter what threat you face, you never give in.
Trump	1	He wrote: "The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army…We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or die."
Trump	1	They thought I was just doing this for fun.
Trump	1	And frankly, they endanger all of our children.
Trump	1	You know what I'm going to say.
Trump	1	 I like that song so much.
Trump	1	Not trillion not 100 Billion, not million, fortunately, not trillion, very fortunately.
Trump	1	Happened over the last two years, by the way.
Trump	1	They -- isn't it incredible?
Trump	1	Great job, Mike.
Trump	1	They don't want to be sanctuary cities anymore, they want out.
Trump	1	And that's when I realized being the president of the United States is a very powerful position.
Trump	1	Now if I was tough, you know, they wanted me to get into a boxing match.
Trump	1	She has none, that I cannot call her Pocahontas anymore.
Trump	1	More American today, right now, this hour, are working than ever before in the history of our country.
Trump	1	That same American spirit that emboldened our founders has kept us strong throughout our history.
Trump	1	And they're also having choice.
Trump	1	Very Strongly.
Trump	1	I said, Mike, what the hell is Presque Isle?
Trump	1	We're in this swamp of Washington, D.C.
Trump	1	But I had to hand off the ball.
Trump	1	Those days are over.
Trump	1	Addiction is not our future.
Trump	1	Countries come in, they want help.
Trump	1	Don't worry about it.
Trump	1	[Applause] How did he do?
Trump	1	Only the dog lover would understand that, right?
Trump	1	So we have our own way.
Trump	1	Household income for Ohio families has reached the highest level in the history of your state, and we have put your coal miners and your steel workers back to work.
Trump	1	It's about reclaiming America's dignity and reawakening America's pride.
Trump	1	You know that.
Trump	1	So we took it right out of the tariffs that we're getting from China.
Trump	1	I kept hearing -- I'd go to a thing, and I'd have -- remember the lines I'd have for the speeches?
Trump	1	They don't get much bigger.
Trump	1	Get it open now.
Trump	1	We'll have the election tomorrow, and on Wednesday, he'll be totally against us.
Trump	1	And think of this.
Trump	1	We want to have no crime.
Trump	1	As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire, and grow than right here in the United States.
Trump	1	This is my state, also.
Trump	1	I said, that's a good time?
Trump	1	Do you believe it?
Trump	1	[Laughter] People are crazy.
Trump	1	And that's what it's all about, folks.
Trump	1	Well, they wouldn't be up here.
Trump	1	This year, it's much higher, because now I feel comfortable.
Trump	1	We won the state of South Carolina by a lot both in the primaries, both in the primaries and in the general election.
Trump	1	We renovated it.
Trump	1	 My Fellow Americans, every day, an average of 116 Americans die from an opioid-related overdose.
Trump	1	After this day of unity and togetherness, I came home and sadly turned on the news and watched as the far-left media once again used tragedy to sow anger and division.
Trump	1	What they're doing to our country is incredible.
Trump	1	We have the greatest economy we've ever had.
Trump	1	We love our country.
Trump	1	And two weeks ago we passed choice, V.A.
Trump	1	You might have seen last month where I called up some of the drug companies.
Trump	1	Past leaders, let China freely plunder the United States economy and take the crown jewels of American industry.
Trump	1	It's all very simple.
Trump	1	People that weren't very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later.
Trump	1	And he's actually leading.
Trump	1	It's called MAGA country, MAGA country.
Trump	1	The most popular person in the history of the Republican Party is Trump.
Trump	1	In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.
Trump	1	Fake news.
Trump	1	We have to be able to go into their military bases to see whether or not they're cheating.
Trump	1	Actually in the one poll, and we have some great pollsters unless it work for CNN, that -- those are -- that's fake news.
Trump	1	They want -- they want everybody coming in.
Trump	1	We'd just go point after point after point.
Trump	1	An economic miracle is taking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations.
Trump	1	We need it.
Trump	1	Republicans want strong borders, no crime, no chaos, and no caravans.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	You're fired.
Trump	1	You know, it's -- some of them are tough relationships because they've really been taken advantage of our country for many, many decades.
Trump	1	So I had five people to choose from to head up my campaign in Ohio.
Trump	1	So important.
Trump	1	So we're doing it step-by-step.
Trump	1	And he said, "I want to thank you, Mr. President, for saving our country.
Trump	1	How stupid are we?
Trump	1	And we're doing things about it, folks.
Trump	1	You will cement the foundation of a glorious American future.
Trump	1	We have the greatest equipment in the world.
Trump	1	A man who has been in there and he has been fighting for me day in and day out.
Trump	1	Wasn't that great?
Trump	1	And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and the right to vote.
Trump	1	And we believe that violent gang members must be thrown out of our country immediately, not let to stay, to fester, and to get larger.
Trump	1	We watch your miners.
Trump	1	You've got to pay for your military.
Trump	1	Thank you!
Trump	1	It didn't happen.
Trump	1	And we haven't been there for two years, but time is flying, isn't it?
Trump	1	And we're going to have tremendous border security that will include the wall — that will include the wall.
Trump	1	Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights.
Trump	1	The whole place was down.
Trump	1	Why doesn't he talk about the economy?
Trump	1	Remember, they said, there is no path.
Trump	1	We got a lot of Barack Obama voters voting for us.
Trump	1	I said, "No.
Trump	1	That's a real deal.
Trump	1	This was an anti-Semitic attack at its worst.
Trump	1	And it's made also -- much less importantly, in this case, David -- but it's also made with American jobs, which is very good.
Trump	1	But now we're doing it right, and we're going to finish it off.
Trump	1	Jeanette.
Trump	1	You will see crime like you've never, ever seen before.
Trump	1	We can't let it happen.
Trump	1	So the Democrats want to abolish ICE, and the Republicans want to cherish ICE.
Trump	1	President Obama tried.
Trump	1	Our ancestors crossed the ocean, settled a continent, won a revolution and fought, to victory, in two world wars.
Trump	1	He ran a great race for Governor.
Trump	1	You're voting for which party controls the House and which party controls the Senate, so all these Congress people.
Trump	1	Nice guy.
Trump	1	You gotta live -- we gotta live with it.
Trump	1	Earlier this month, I announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	And as we speak, Canada -- and we love Canada, right?
Trump	1	He promised to me.
Trump	1	Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.
Trump	1	You got to pay."
Trump	1	Okay?
Trump	1	It was the Marines who, after two long days of battle, marched through the Halls of Montezuma.
Trump	1	Democrats believe illegal border crossers should be immediately set free.
Trump	1	As sure as you're standing -- they're sorry for no seats, but the crowd was bigger than they're supposed to be... [Laughter] But as sure are you're standing there, they are going to -- they want to destroy your Social Security.
Trump	1	If you want a safe and prosperous future for Ohio, vote for Mike DeWine.
Trump	1	So find out.
Trump	1	And it's openly inviting millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our nation.
Trump	1	And I'll tell you.
Trump	1	And we have so many other things that we've done and so many other things that we're doing, we're very proud of it.
Trump	1	Even if you have something minor, that -- a pill, a prescription, something easy could do.
Trump	1	We have only just begun.
Trump	1	We should have had health care, but one man decided to vote against us at the last moment.
Trump	1	I mean, it's incredible what's happening.
Trump	1	Make their countries great again.
Trump	1	They could be sadists.
Trump	1	And they've got to start being partners to keep this -- really, look, is just an incredible miracle that's going on?
Trump	1	For 100 years they were with Democrats.
Trump	1	Sometimes they wouldn't be able to see a doctor for so long that by the time they got treatment, they would be terminally ill.
Trump	1	"They want a socialist takeover of" -- now I say wants a socialist takeover... [Laughter] I'm trying to be nice, OK?
Trump	1	We did it.
Trump	1	And that has to stop.
Trump	1	They all helped.
Trump	1	That's so nice.
Trump	1	We've done -- with all the dumping; they're not doing so much dumping anymore.
Trump	1	Just for the media: I'm sure he's a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum.
Trump	1	You're fired.
Trump	1	Thanks, Phil.
Trump	1	[Laughter] They like the fact that you can't see it.
Trump	1	They said, "Donald Trump has won, for the first time in many years, both of them, the great state of Michigan," and you people didn't get the privilege of taking us over the top.
Trump	1	To fund more agents -- we're putting that high on the list -- officers, beds.
Trump	1	Thank you, fellas.
Trump	1	William McKinley has not been properly recognized.
Trump	1	You're the one that did it.
Trump	1	Seriously injured.
Trump	1	But he did call and he said, "We'd like to meet."
Trump	1	He was gone -- he was gone so fast.
Trump	1	You -- Where's Lindsey?
Trump	1	They want to have low taxes for their family, not high taxes.
Trump	1	She leaked.
Trump	1	We've created six million new jobs since election day.
Trump	1	When I fought for them recently, they gave me so much money for everything else but nothing for the wall.
Trump	1	But I don't think they're going to be focusing on space maybe like they should.
Trump	1	Come on up here -- no, I'm kidding.
Trump	1	Thanks, Scott.
Trump	1	But I think they're getting tired of it.
Trump	1	Ted.
Trump	1	We did a great job and we feel great about it.
Trump	1	We will never give in.
Trump	1	We had no choice; we put those heavy tariffs on.
Trump	1	Winning, winning, winning, winning again.
Trump	1	The truth is, with these people, you can't win, but we're winning.
Trump	1	And it's also telling you whether or not this stuff works.
Trump	1	But they're great people, and they have a great leader -- Prime Minister Abe -- and he understands.
Trump	1	She will be told to do so.
Trump	1	You have some where you need 10 agencies to approve the exact same thing.
Trump	1	Because we are finally putting America first again.
Trump	1	Mike Braun.
Trump	1	But if they're not going to approve it, somebody doesn't have to give up their entire life going through an approval process only to have a 3 to 2 vote -- "we're not going to approve it."
Trump	1	She was in a non-coal state, talking about how she was going to put the coal business out of business.
Trump	1	The Dems want to raise your taxes.
Trump	1	That's why I've called on Congress to pass legislation banning the late-term abortion of children who can feel the pain in their mother's womb.
Trump	1	Lot of strong people, but if you don't have this it doesn't matter.
Trump	1	She's so incredible.
Trump	1	And it's happening fast.
Trump	1	Dump all you want.
Trump	1	So, Democrats, I had to bring that out, you know, just boom, boom, boom, why not?
Trump	1	We're going to take care of everything.
Trump	1	The politicians just watched as other countries stole our jobs, plundered our wealth and looted the crown jewels of the American economy.
Trump	1	I'm also thrilled to say that we have secured for our military servicemembers and their families the largest -- you don't really want it, you're too patriotic for this -- the largest pay raise in almost a decade.
Trump	1	Can you believe this?
Trump	1	A guy comes in, as an example, West Side Highway in Manhattan.
Trump	1	And we need Kevin Cramer to replace liberal Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in the Senate.
Trump	1	We have a wall that wasn't a wall.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	And the Democrats refuse to do it.
Trump	1	Nearly two decades ago, the same politicians who gave us NAFTA also voted to admit China into the World Trade Organization, a disastrous, really decision.
Trump	1	Look how many reporters.
Trump	1	OK?
Trump	1	We're pulling it back out of Congress.
Trump	1	True story.
Trump	1	Kim Jong Won, we have a great -- Chairman Kim, we have a great chemistry and we're well on our way.
Trump	1	Thank you, Jim Brown.
Trump	1	You know on Long Island we have towns where they have a lot of the MS-13.
Trump	1	That's great.
Trump	1	How dare you."
Trump	1	I said it last night, we have some great, great friends in the media too.
Trump	1	Actually, her father came out like almost immediately for me, and it was interesting because I didn't know him.
Trump	1	We are doing really well.
Trump	1	That's not for us folks.
Trump	1	It's great to be with you, Jane.
Trump	1	Please don't do that.
Trump	1	We got it done, and now we can say, Jim, you're fired.
Trump	1	The United States cannot have an open border to every illegal alien family and minor on the face of the earth.
Trump	1	A lot of things have changed.
Trump	1	And you know, I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel, they want to wait till they get, oh they're praying, they're praying.
Trump	1	Women didn't do quite as well.
Trump	1	He said it's the best location.
Trump	1	Then, How does this have anything to do with the campaign, the judge asks.
Trump	1	We're going to be an even greater country.
Trump	1	A good man, but they broke the deal.
Trump	1	Got to do it.
Trump	1	We will make America safe again.
Trump	1	And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean -- how horrible.
Trump	1	We protect ICE, and our border patrol, and our law enforcement, and our fire department.
Trump	1	You know what?
Trump	1	They're important jobs.
Trump	1	100 years ago this summer, the women's suffrage movement led Congress to pass the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote.
Trump	1	The steel company today announced a 500-million-dollar plant, and that's first plant built in many, many years, it's a long time.
Trump	1	We'll make a great deal."
Trump	1	$6 billion we got approved.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	That sounds worse, I think, that's worse, but we'll save it for whoever is going to be the nominee.
Trump	1	They got Trump all over the place, and they're great.
Trump	1	No longer will we allow other countries to tie America's hands and take America's jobs and hurt America's energy.
Trump	1	That's not bad.
Trump	1	Thank you, Indiana.
Trump	1	Is that possible that can happen?
Trump	1	If you don't have borders, you don't have a country, folks, you don't have a country.
Trump	1	Sir -- and we're talking about billions -- and last year, Secretary Stoltenberg, Secretary General, head of NATO, he goes -- he's like my biggest fan.
Trump	1	So now a patient is terminally ill, we have something that's looking really good, we make them sign a document, very important document, and they go in and we work with them and we see if we can help them.
Trump	1	Thank you, and God bless you all.
Trump	1	They don't want it, they don't care about military, they don't care about our law enforcement.
Trump	1	[Booing] I actually think, in many ways, it's worse.
Trump	1	You are in a lottery system from these countries.
Trump	1	We'll end up being another Venezuela.
Trump	1	What's he going to stop?
Trump	1	The individual mandate, Mike.
Trump	1	And those caravans are slowly breaking up, and they're going back where they came from, and they have to come into our country legally.
Trump	1	But the laws are not helping us, because we have some laws that are very much against everything that we stand for in this room.
Trump	1	And America is winning again.
Trump	1	We have borders down 40 percent, and it's tough because our economy is doing so well.
Trump	1	Because we're achieving our goals better than anyone thought possible.
Trump	1	It's going to all happen.
Trump	1	Make a good deal, please.
Trump	1	You know, I've had steel workers and...
Trump	1	They paid 1.8 billion in cash, probably for hostage.
Trump	1	That was a bad one though.
Trump	1	"Oh, sorry, how are you?
Trump	1	Of course, the Washington Post -- a guy named David Weigel -- he wrote an article, some arena -- [Audience Boos] No, listen to this.
Trump	1	You have to do it.
Trump	1	This is 250,000 jobs despite your -- I have to -- your hurricane.
Trump	1	I think we agree.
Trump	1	I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads and families -- no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
Trump	1	Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century, and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded.
Trump	1	We are one united movement, one united people and one United States of America.Because together with the very proud and very truly incredible and inspiring people of Michigan we will make America wealthy again.
Trump	1	Have you seen?
Trump	1	They're dead.
Trump	1	Keep America Great.
Trump	1	When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: "Last day of Keemo."
Trump	1	Thank you, John.
Trump	1	Russia.
Trump	1	That's the Sandy Hook people, the great people of Sandy Hook.
Trump	1	Nobody wants to talk about the jobs created, and nobody wants to talk about all the money that's flowing in to the coffers of the United States of America.
Trump	1	So many people.
Trump	1	We make the best rockets.
Trump	1	We couldn't use the kind of assets that we have.
Trump	1	South Korea, remember, they came over from South Korea, they stopped, North Korea, South Korea, the Olympics, and it started with the Olympics which Chairman Kim said, "We want to go to the Olympics."
Trump	1	He said the closest.
Trump	1	[Laughter] But we're doing good.
Trump	1	They send their products in.
Trump	1	Get him out.
Trump	1	We have only one-way streets, not only China, with everybody.
Trump	1	And it's in the pipeline, and it takes a while, although we've cut the time way, way down.
Trump	1	They've heard that before in this business.
Trump	1	They work hard.
Trump	1	For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
Trump	1	We are standing up for Florida and we are proudly standing for our great national anthem.
Trump	1	NAFTA was a disaster, and we've changed it around.
Trump	1	They have a lot of options, but they said it's the finest coal.
Trump	1	Catch and release you catch 'em and you release 'em.
Trump	1	But we should have done it when we had the position.
Trump	1	No more.
Trump	1	I responded so nicely.
Trump	1	You just saw it with a high-quality, highest quality, this incredible man.
Trump	1	"Raisin."
Trump	1	Great deal.
Trump	1	But that payment is a little less than the second payment.
Trump	1	There's practically not lights.
Trump	1	But now we talk about problems that we want to fix.
Trump	1	I guess that didn't work out too well.
Trump	1	Accountability with the vets.
Trump	1	That's the first most of you have heard of it.
Trump	1	We've taken unprecedented action to confront the regime in Iran, and we have ended the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear catastrophe.
Trump	1	She's been there for a little while and in that little while everybody really respects her.
Trump	1	They have a little corner of a building.
Trump	1	They definitely need help.
Trump	1	That's why you have to have Patrick Morrisey and Carol.
Trump	1	We couldn't even get near the arena.
Trump	1	Come up.
Trump	1	We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.
Trump	1	We will win.
Trump	1	You know you may have heard, I was invited to another event tonight, The White House Correspondents Dinner [Booing], but I'd much rather be in Washington, Michigan than in Washington DC right now, that I could tell you.
Trump	1	And it's going down.
Trump	1	If Hillary got in you wouldn't have that stat, I can tell you right now.
Trump	1	They didn't even know.
Trump	1	Their policies are putting all of America at risk.
Trump	1	"Biggest problem is North Korea.
Trump	1	They can't take a joke.
Trump	1	The energy revolution that you're leading is an incredible story, and it could only be written right here.
Trump	1	A vote for Patrick Morrisey is truly a vote to make America great again.
Trump	1	And the enthusiasm, I hate to tell you, the enthusiasm that you have tonight, in West Virginia, it was exactly the same.
Trump	1	Respectfully.
Trump	1	We have the greatest people, ICE, Border Patrol, law enforcement.
Trump	1	They put foreign citizens before American citizens.
Trump	1	A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, and more products made right here in the USA.
Trump	1	You know, the Electoral College was set up so we can't win, except we had one problem: we won a lot of states that haven't been won for many years by Republicans.
Trump	1	So you won it.
Trump	1	We think of that one and she looks down with contempt on the hardworking Americans saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country.
Trump	1	Thank you, Alex.
Trump	1	You're getting it.
Trump	1	But do yourself -- just pretend he's one point down, please, OK?
Trump	1	They're going to build their plants in this country.
Trump	1	They have a lot of hatred in their heart.
Trump	1	They defend our great American flag.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	And they tried to destroy him.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much, Juanita.
Trump	1	They make it up.
Trump	1	Nebraska.
Trump	1	He has done a great job.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	Oh, good -- come back in a couple of years.
Trump	1	Just get out and vote.
Trump	1	Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning because we are finally putting America first.
Trump	1	This is the Eighth Wonder of the World.
Trump	1	So we like South Korea.
Trump	1	I said, Really?
Trump	1	But we'll take it, right?
Trump	1	As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our sovereignty, overrun our borders and destroy our nation in so many ways and we can't let it happen.
Trump	1	We didn't pay $1.8 billion, right?
Trump	1	He or she I couldn't tell from the back.
Trump	1	What?
Trump	1	And it turned out that that was just the beginning.
Trump	1	That would have been a dream 5 years ago.
Trump	1	In the month of June alone, 600,000 workers entered or reentered the workforce.
Trump	1	Incredible.
Trump	1	Rick?
Trump	1	[Applause] Because we need Democrat votes.
Trump	1	Thank you, Nathan.
Trump	1	Over the last two years, we have secured nearly $1.5 trillion to provide our warfighters the finest aircraft, ships, missiles, and tanks anywhere on Earth.
Trump	1	I'd say, "But it's true."
Trump	1	That's a big one.
Trump	1	It took me like two minutes and we get it done.
Trump	1	This woman came out and said she made up the story.
Trump	1	He considers it a treasure.
Trump	1	They didn't do their job.
Trump	1	You notice that nobody looks at them?
Trump	1	Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, "Mercedes" -- and Sarah -- "show them the pictures.
Trump	1	Very shortly, it's all happening.
Trump	1	You will make America great again.
Trump	1	And we go -- but, boy, it's tough.
Trump	1	And you people are pros, most of you, not all of you.
Trump	1	Right-to-Try.
Trump	1	In other words, hitting Trump, incorrectly, but hitting Trump.
Trump	1	Make America Great Again.
Trump	1	1producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.
Trump	1	Not even close.
Trump	1	You look at the European Union.
Trump	1	So we're building them the wall.
Trump	1	And Republicans proudly stand with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol and law enforcement, our police.
Trump	1	It's a personal choice, but I think maybe we should recommend that to a lot of people.
Trump	1	But we're trying to keep those premiums from the remnant of Obamacare down.
Trump	1	How do you win on that platform?
Trump	1	You know, I know a lot of people in this room, and pretty tough guys, but you don't want to fight ICE.
Trump	1	And I'm President and they are not, right?
Trump	1	They couldn't do it, and we got it done.
Trump	1	[Applause] And it was a great meeting.
Trump	1	"Sir, I've been a catapulter.
Trump	1	We've already started.
Trump	1	Democrats plan to kill Medicare Advantage and, really, it's especially unfair to Hispanic Americans.
Trump	1	So let me say very clearly to those pushing this ridiculous and radical agenda, I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country.
Trump	1	Sorry folks, you got to pay for this.
Trump	1	They respect our country again.
Trump	1	[Applause] But this is all because we're one country and, really, one family.
Trump	1	Clean power plan is out of business now.
Trump	1	Representing the Air Force you will soon see beautiful, brand new F-22 Raptors from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia -- and one magnificent B-2 Stealth Bomber from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	He's just having fun."
Trump	1	We have more people working now than ever before.
Trump	1	And we're purchasing the finest planes in the world.
Trump	1	Eight hundred billion is not even conceivable, and we didn't do anything about it, and I mean, not only President Obama, I mean others too.
Trump	1	But Fannie and Freddie can do a lot better than they're doing, although now they have some very good people running it.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	It's going to be hopefully very easy debates.
Trump	1	Just remember, we're going to do something that, honestly, nobody else could do.
Trump	1	I said, "Will it be like this always?"
Trump	1	And they're going to kill your Medicare.
Trump	1	We go forward to victory.
Trump	1	Sorry.
Trump	1	We're developing.
Trump	1	OK?
Trump	1	You remember two weeks ago, Pfizer -- and I take my hat off to them -- I like them -- they increased their prices substantially of drugs.
Trump	1	Nucor -- Nucor, a big steel company is building brand new plants $750 million, $900 million brand new plants.
Trump	1	Look at our military.
Trump	1	They think that that's a good issue for them.
Trump	1	So -- so, we're going to have not lottery where you pick it out.
Trump	1	We have a great lead in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in South Carolina.
Trump	1	Passed; signed.
Trump	1	No, no.
Trump	1	We like that."
Trump	1	Thank you man.
Trump	1	When I got involved, I said, You got to help me with this, because why have you never been able to pass tax cuts?
Trump	1	That's not right.
Trump	1	Did you ever see anything like what's going on?
Trump	1	America thanks you more than anybody.
Trump	1	It's also a vote for be careful of your Second Amendment, okay, be careful.
Trump	1	I brought one.
Trump	1	African-American and Hispanic-American unemployment have reached the lowest levels in the history of our country.
Trump	1	You see legislation.
Trump	1	She said but how would I get to my island?
Trump	1	We've built a lot of wall already and fixed a lot of wall, but we get that.
Trump	1	And it could happen.
Trump	1	We all salute the same great American flag and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
Trump	1	We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
Trump	1	And very interestingly, at first everybody was amazed -- amazed that we had the meeting.
Trump	1	They had to wait for two weeks and three weeks and seven weeks and -- to see a doctor.
Trump	1	I stayed for Thanksgiving.
Trump	1	It's true.
Trump	1	Never.
Trump	1	But I'm not increasing taxes.
Trump	1	And if you don't love it, get something else.
Trump	1	Thank you, Steve, for being here.
Trump	1	And even though we got a little surprise vote that evening, you all remember that evening somebody came in with a thumbs down after campaigning for years that he was going to repeal and replace.
Trump	1	In fiscal year 2017 alone, ICE arrested more than 127,000 aliens charged or convicted of crimes inside of the United States.
Trump	1	And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers.
Trump	1	Remember?
Trump	1	Republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism.
Trump	1	[Applause] Many, many companies are coming back to our country.
Trump	1	These actions are endangering our citizens, threatening our communities, and undermining our national security.
Trump	1	These businesses are saying they are fantastic.
Trump	1	And more so.
Trump	1	 So, I want to thank your former governor and your current vice president.
Trump	1	Think of that.
Trump	1	Very simple.
Trump	1	Let's -- when they wait on line for 10 days, 22 days, 38 days, you have to see, months and months, why don't we let them go see a private doctor and we paid the bill?
Trump	1	Our steel industry is one of the hottest industries in the country right now.
Trump	1	And from now on, small business owners will be spared from the deeply unfair estate tax, also known as the "death tax."
Trump	1	Holier than thou, aren't they?
Trump	1	Simple.
Trump	1	Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters through our southern border.
Trump	1	Don’t fall asleep.
Trump	1	[Audience Calls Out Lou] So while Lou is fighting for you, Bob Casey is fighting to protect violent criminal aliens.
Trump	1	We also passed veterans' choice.
Trump	1	We'll actually do better.
Trump	1	Nah, that's not going to happen.
Trump	1	And I said to him, great people, 28 nations, including the US, I said to him, "Listen, we're taking care of you.
Trump	1	So during the negotiation I said, "You've got to fix the NFL problem."
Trump	1	It's all a ruse.
Trump	1	Representing the Marine Corps today will be a brand new VH-92, soon to serve as Marine One -- along with two V-22 Ospreys from the famed HMX-1 helicopter squadron at Quantico, the "Nighthawks."
Trump	1	Resist.
Trump	1	Those are the numbers we're talking about, OK?
Trump	1	He happens to be a nice guy.
Trump	1	Can you believe it?
Trump	1	As crazy as it sounds, we have such potential.
Trump	1	That's what happens.
Trump	1	You're going to live in a socialist world, and put illegal aliens before American citizens.
Trump	1	They're looking -- I'm telling you, it's like -- like watching World War II movies.
Trump	1	Couldn't we?
Trump	1	It's horrible.
Trump	1	By the way, tomorrow if you don't mind make it not even close too.
Trump	1	Cindy will be with every single one of them.
Trump	1	Was it going to be a right deal, but -- but we have a great relationship, we'll see what happens, I hope we're going to be able to do something.
Trump	1	Might as well tell you.
Trump	1	Corey?
Trump	1	Again, I've only been here about 17 times.
Trump	1	They mortgage the farm to pay the estate taxes or death taxes, as it's called.
Trump	1	And that guy is helping a lot.
Trump	1	Vote for Tarkanian.
Trump	1	You are warriors.
Trump	1	Having the most powerful military, by far, that we've ever had means we'l probably never have to use it.
Trump	1	It's great.
Trump	1	Instead of apologizing for America, we are standing up for America, and we are standing up for our great American flag.
Trump	1	They're much better fighters of wars, believe me, than they are negotiators for money.
Trump	1	What -- it's very simple what's going on.
Trump	1	You know, "Hey, we just won the presidency."
Trump	1	These -- bwah, wah.
Trump	1	But we're turning it around very quickly, much quicker than anyone thought possible.
Trump	1	Many acres.
Trump	1	I said, Greg, how much is it?
Trump	1	Republicans passed a massive tax cut for Mississippi families.
Trump	1	Where's Billy?
Trump	1	Just ask Bernie Sanders.
Trump	1	Oh, let's get to another subject.
Trump	1	Total success.
Trump	1	Is there?
Trump	1	They're gladly taking our stuff.
Trump	1	Da Nang Dick, you know, Da Nang.
Trump	1	While you know that you know where this is right, next to Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Does anyone know Mind Valley Works near Pittsburgh?
Trump	1	[Laughter] Wherever you're going to go, stay in North Carolina.
Trump	1	You know, what started off under President Obama very bit, and -- and under President Bush and under many presidents, but it started off very, very bad.
Trump	1	 Thank you.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much, everybody.
Trump	1	Proud of you.
Trump	1	And I'm so happy about that.
Trump	1	I say it, and I say it all the time.
Trump	1	That was an Obama special.
Trump	1	Democrats want to raise your taxes, they want to destroy your jobs... [Booing] They want to crush our industries with crippling regulations, and you know the stock market is up almost 40 percent since that great November day.
Trump	1	Any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself.
Trump	1	We're turning that.
Trump	1	They don't get the bad press.
Trump	1	But think of that, opioid, big problem, big problem, deaths went down, opioid deaths, 22 percent.
Trump	1	And his name was Bill Smith, President Bill, they would say he is the greatest conservative of all time.
Trump	1	And he goes, Mr. President, could I ask you one small question?
Trump	1	And DACA is very much tied to the wall, and we have to have the wall.
Trump	1	Thank you very much, everybody.
Trump	1	They don't even know why they are doing it, but we have to have borders and we have to have them fast, and we need security, we need the wall.
Trump	1	Why would we talk to you."
Trump	1	Certain types of dogs, pretty good.
Trump	1	Take forever court after court after court, and then they end up making deals.
Trump	1	He's doing well.
Trump	1	And I'll also add: Who are tougher than the men, actually.
Trump	1	Maybe it'll be good and maybe it won't.
Trump	1	It takes 17, 18 years to get a highway approved.
Trump	1	And remember this because it's very important and I'm speaking now for the Republican party, we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always.
Trump	1	These are great, incredible, strong tough, tough people.
Trump	1	Big difference.
Trump	1	We're not doing that.
Trump	1	And you know, the end of the week I meet with China.
Trump	1	I love this state and I love the people of this state.
Trump	1	They said, he said they get a Rolls Royce but they don't get a Rolls Royce.
Trump	1	And, for those people -- remember I used to say, And who's going to pay for the wall?
Trump	1	Because of the internet, worse today than it's ever been.
Trump	1	Just think, because you never hear this from the fake news.
Trump	1	A lot of politics is common sense.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	I've got to talk to him.
Trump	1	I don't think it was a miracle.
Trump	1	So he said, "Sir, if you want," and I said, "I'd like to have you do it.
Trump	1	Democrats haven't learned.
Trump	1	[Applause] And on June 12th, in Singapore, I'll be meeting with Kim Jong-un to pursue a future of peace and security for the world -- for the whole world.
Trump	1	Look, women for Trump.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos] You know, I gave Mike, a little while ago, something that I saw -- but he's seen it -- the Indianapolis Star did a story, and I guess it's a poll of some kind.
Trump	1	The women's unemployment rate -- I'm sorry, women, damn it -- is the lowest in only 65 years, not history.
Trump	1	And most importantly, I want to congraduate -- I want to congratulate the state of Louisiana and all of the work we've done together with the federal government.
Trump	1	Great job, Debra.
Trump	1	So between Scott and Leah, who's in favor of those two great people, right?
Trump	1	Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told: the story of America.
Trump	1	I never thought I was going to say I'm a politician.
Trump	1	[Applause] We just opened Argentina to American pork exports -- pork -- for the first time in a quarter of a century.
Trump	1	We are going to work, we're going to fight and we're going to win for our families, for our flag, and for our freedom.
Trump	1	Congressman Gus Bilirakis.
Trump	1	Today's democrats are not just extreme; they're really not in a position to govern.
Trump	1	I'd almost like to repeat that.
Trump	1	Great people.
Trump	1	What's going on here?
Trump	1	Bill Nelson voted against Neil Gorsuch and he voted against Brett Kavanaugh.
Trump	1	And instead of going up, the market would be half of what it was if we're lucky, because frankly the tax cuts were incredible to what we've done.
Trump	1	But a lot of us weren’t surprised by it, but the other side said, "Where did all of those people come from?"
Trump	1	He said he did 631 events.
Trump	1	It's happening.
Trump	1	I spoke with Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa this morning.
Trump	1	I want to put it down, tax cuts."
Trump	1	It's too far away.
Trump	1	That's a good team.
Trump	1	Remember, they used to say, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.
Trump	1	On a cold December morning in 1903, a miracle occurred over the dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, when two bicycle makers from Ohio defied gravity with a 12 horsepower engine, wings made of cotton, and just a few dollars in their pockets.
Trump	1	You know what?
Trump	1	We're embarking on bald initiatives to defeat AIDS.
Trump	1	Remember, I used to tell you about winning, we're winning.
Trump	1	And it was the presidency.
Trump	1	Where's Andy?
Trump	1	They have a fast train.
Trump	1	Open borders.
Trump	1	We're saving farmers and ranchers from one of the most ridiculous regulations ever imposed on anybody in our nation: the Waters of the United States rule.
Trump	1	Your incomes have gone way up.
Trump	1	Several terrific members of Congress are here today as well.
Trump	1	She's fantastic.
Trump	1	Nobody could get it done.
Trump	1	Republicans are the party of safety.
Trump	1	By the way, ICE, great Americans.
Trump	1	And we also passed -- 46 years they've been trying.
Trump	1	October 16.
Trump	1	That was not an easy one.
Trump	1	The most in many, many years.
Trump	1	Forty-five years.
Trump	1	We'll -- we're -- we're setting the stage folks.
Trump	1	She opposes the wall, which we've started and we've done a lot of work on it, but I'd like to get it done quickly.
Trump	1	So if you want to really just keep up what we're doing and keep this country -- we have tremendous potential.
Trump	1	And we had an incredible display of talent.
Trump	1	No, we're doing manufacturing jobs at numbers that people haven't seen before.
Trump	1	Tremendous.
Trump	1	We're taking care of our great veterans and rebuilding America's military might.
Trump	1	And we're standing up for our national anthem and our flag.
Trump	1	And so congratulations to the folks from this area and from this great state.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	When President of France came in to see me, President Macron, wondering guy -- Emmanuel, we like shaking each other's hand.
Trump	1	Plus our new deal makes it extremely hard for companies to fire all their workers and leave.
Trump	1	Our veterans were waiting on line for two days, seven days, three weeks, five weeks, you had veterans waiting on line that could have easily been taken care of.
Trump	1	Because of here.
Trump	1	You know, there is no mission our pilots can't handle.
Trump	1	Our military -- and we just had it approved -- $700 billion.
Trump	1	Do you know why?
Trump	1	They've squeezed the blood out of them.
Trump	1	Maybe you'll only sell it if you get the right price.
Trump	1	We got it passed, 44, 46 years.
Trump	1	I said, here's his number.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	That came along with the biggest tax cuts in our history.
Trump	1	You haven't heard that for a long time, for many, many decades, you haven't heard.
Trump	1	That's very tough on us on trade and various other things.
Trump	1	But it's working well.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	In the audience today is Val Wagner from Monango, North Dakota.
Trump	1	Boy oh boy, that was great.
Trump	1	We don't have a presidential election coming up.
Trump	1	They want to get the power that they so desperately crave that was taken away from them.
Trump	1	We like David, right?
Trump	1	Is that a good sound bite?
Trump	1	Wages are rising fast, and the lowest-paid workers are making the biggest percentage gains of all.
Trump	1	She's wacky.
Trump	1	It's incredible.
Trump	1	We were only kidding, Mr.," -- and that's when I realized how powerful the presidency is.
Trump	1	[Booing] And we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular aspect and most of Obamacare will be gone very soon.
Trump	1	What he did -- what he did was vicious.
Trump	1	I think, they're -- and he's supposed to be elite?
Trump	1	Number two, they never show up.
Trump	1	That just shows when you get good ratings, you can say anything.
Trump	1	The polls have just closed in Texas, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.
Trump	1	And we're stuck with them.
Trump	1	But, really, there's nothing like a good broker.
Trump	1	Some will come here for a stay, but a lot of them are going to be going back home, where they want to be, with their families.
Trump	1	Nothing.
Trump	1	By the way, nobody talks about, but we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.
Trump	1	So instead of doing this, you would have foreign countries doing that and then shipping it back.
Trump	1	[Applause] Oxford.
Trump	1	From the second the Supreme Court vacancy opened, Democrats were on a heartless campaign of political and personal destruction.
Trump	1	The barriers are coming down.
Trump	1	That's a big thing.
Trump	1	It was going to close.
Trump	1	But when you do something great and they make it sound fair, just like, OK, you know, you can't make it sound -- they try to make it horrible, but you do good stuff, and they try and make it sound as bad -- MSNBC is probably worse than CNN, all right?
Trump	1	Not nice.
Trump	1	And the Democrats, they're going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it won't have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency.
Trump	1	And that's going to be very historical.
Trump	1	As we reverse the damage of decades of unfair trade, we are also providing up to $12 billion in relief to protect our farmers from unfair foreign retaliation.
Trump	1	That's a big one.
Trump	1	And you know, when that came about, people were calling for him to immediately get out.
Trump	1	[Applause] My administration has also made officer safety a top priority.
Trump	1	Our American ancestors braved the oceans, tamed the wilderness, won a revolution, and fought to victory in two world wars.
Trump	1	Unemployment is at its lowest level since the turn of the century.
Trump	1	Get used to it.
Trump	1	So now we need Democrats in Congress to work with us to pass an acceptable bill.
Trump	1	But if we do that all the environmental groups are going to sue us.
Trump	1	 My fellow Americans.
Trump	1	They fire all their workers.
Trump	1	Make American safe again and we will make America great again.
Trump	1	 Thank you very much, El Paso.
Trump	1	What they put up is incredible and that includes Border Patrol and that includes law enforcement.
Trump	1	We're standing up for your values.
Trump	1	So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax.
Trump	1	Can you imagine if he didn't get the job because of that?
Trump	1	Can you believe that?
Trump	1	Hopefully you don't have to use it, OK?
Trump	1	But to continue this incredible momentum, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote for Greg Gianforte and Matt Rosendale.
Trump	1	I got 'em all.
Trump	1	They're disturbed, but it's what -- that's OK. We love our guys.
Trump	1	So he goes, Mr. Trump, he goes, I want to just tell you that, I don't know what's going on, but I've been a congressman for a long time.
Trump	1	And you know what?
Trump	1	[Applause] The best way -- so important -- and the best way to beat the drug crisis is to keep people from getting hooked on drugs to begin with.
Trump	1	There's been no missiles or rockets flying beautifully over Japan.
Trump	1	Because they are not liking my poll numbers even a little bit.
Trump	1	It was a big deal.
Trump	1	But we're standing on the shoulders of true American patriots who put down the railroads, built up the highways and dug out a thing called the Panama Canal and lost many lives doing it -- mosquitoes, lost many, many lives.
Trump	1	It's a great business.
Trump	1	And now we just look at them and we say, get your ass out of here, you're fired.
Trump	1	We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life.
Trump	1	We can't allow that.
Trump	1	Justin Trudeau, nice guy, but they've taken advantage of us for so many years that we have to take our time.
Trump	1	We could've taken your jobs, all.
Trump	1	We have plenty left.
Trump	1	And by the way, did you see those job numbers?
Trump	1	That's what we're doing.
Trump	1	But if I get the job, I said the first thing I do is going to visit a farm."
Trump	1	Oh!
Trump	1	We just got poll numbers for some of the Senate races.
Trump	1	And he voted -- and he -- believe this is somebody -- he's not into the American military, but we are.
Trump	1	We need votes.
Trump	1	So essentially, what I'm saying is we're going to come up with a health care plan.
Trump	1	Oh, and there's another talented governor.
Trump	1	And it's going way up.
Trump	1	I wish people would get that into their heads, because the other side is fighting pre- -- it's the only thing they have.
Trump	1	To get that, we are coming up with great health care.
Trump	1	It's all working out great.
Trump	1	The biggest economy in the world, by far.
Trump	1	Democrats want judges who will rewrite the Constitution any way they want to do it, and take away your Second Amendment, erase your borders... [Booing] ... throw open the jailhouse doors and destroy your freedoms.
Trump	1	You see what's happening.
Trump	1	She has been incredible as a leader of the GOP, she's the Chair, and she's my friend, Jane Timken.
Trump	1	I mean, it just happened as I came off the plane.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I won't say it.
Trump	1	They'd -- there'd be some kind of a thing that they heard of.
Trump	1	And we're talking about a wall for $20 billion, $15 billion.
Trump	1	They lost legs.
Trump	1	Where's my speechwriter?
Trump	1	But they are doing a spectacular job.
Trump	1	If you vote Republican this November, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes like we've been doing.
Trump	1	And remember this, you know, we picked up since I got elected, we picked up tremendous worth, we've picked up anywhere from nine to seven, to seven to nine trillion dollars.
Trump	1	You notice, a lot of love in these rooms.
Trump	1	They cannot come in the way they want to come in.
Trump	1	And we have many, many cases like that.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.
Trump	1	You see what's happening, although everyone is doing well right now, everybody, the companies are doing great when Wall Street does good, that's a good thing for us.
Trump	1	And they have no money.
Trump	1	President Obama used to talk about the carbon footprint and he'd hop on Air Force One, a big 747 with very old engines, and he'd fly to Hawaii to play a round of golf.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	And if they don't and I'm telling you right now we will close the damn border.
Trump	1	By the way, by the way, by the way we have thousands of people so -- and this is it I'm not even announcing today, we'll wait for a couple of weeks, OK?
Trump	1	[Booing] And then when I want to raise the game and play the game of poker, a game that we can't lose, I'll get even politicians, mostly Democrats, but even a couple of Republicans.
Trump	1	We have some congressmen.
Trump	1	We have to use it for our country.
Trump	1	And he said that.
Trump	1	They got hit hard, especially when you look at -- when you look at Florida, did you ever see anything like that?
Trump	1	We will achieve victory for our magnificent country and our magnificent land -- the land that we love.
Trump	1	He's from a slightly competitive state.
Trump	1	There's never been.
Trump	1	Get the discussions going.
Trump	1	Just the remnants.
Trump	1	I haven't had one of these things happen in a long time.
Trump	1	I withdrew the United States from the unfair and very, very expensive for our country Paris Climate Accord.
Trump	1	But I assume -- you know, because any deal you make, they have no idea what the deal is.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	And African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country.
Trump	1	But we'll always be defending America's rights to have low-cost, high-quality healthcare of your choice.
Trump	1	But actually you see all the people back there?
Trump	1	Thanks Matt.
Trump	1	We are doing so well.
Trump	1	And then he cried.
Trump	1	And it grows every week.
Trump	1	Terrific people.
Trump	1	Sleazebag.
Trump	1	And by the way, she will end up trying -- with them, they've got a long way to go -- trying to increase your taxes very substantially.
Trump	1	You got to be a warrior.
Trump	1	He was a strong guy.
Trump	1	And I can't believe that many of these Democrats that have gone so far left -- I knew them, and when you say the wall -- first of all, we started the wall.
Trump	1	We're going to beat everybody, we have the greatest military.
Trump	1	Then it comes -- three times.
Trump	1	It doesn't go so quickly, although in this case went very fast.
Trump	1	Think of it.
Trump	1	 Hello, everyone.
Trump	1	But we're getting it built and it's already going up in San Diego and lots of other places along the border.
Trump	1	They're good at sticking together.
Trump	1	Do you believe it?
Trump	1	Huh."
Trump	1	Does that make sense?
Trump	1	They can see a private doctor, and we pay the bill.
Trump	1	And the same thing with Hispanic American unemployment, which is also at the lowest level in history -- unemployment, lowest level in history.
Trump	1	Great respect.
Trump	1	He was destroying people's lives.
Trump	1	Devastated.
Trump	1	The Democrats want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens, MS-13 killers, and anybody else that wants to come in.
Trump	1	That's why we're doing so well.
Trump	1	That didn't happen by accident.
Trump	1	It was heading down.
Trump	1	There's no inflation, essentially.
Trump	1	Thank you, Bob.
Trump	1	I think you do.
Trump	1	They're great.
Trump	1	They don't like it when we have good polls.
Trump	1	And then she says to me, "Well, what did you know about this?"
Trump	1	So now we are defending our borders for our country and the people of our country.
Trump	1	Baby, I got the hostages back.
Trump	1	We have tremendous people, and what we're doing now with Right-to-try is incredible, you sign a document and you try, and in many cases it's going to work, and it's hope, it's hope it's really something special.
Trump	1	The shooter fled and fired shots at him, but Officer Dallas chased him down before a single student was injured.
Trump	1	Today I kept another major promise, as I said, to the people of Iowa and Nebraska and other countries.
Trump	1	Oh.
Trump	1	Kellyanne, stand up.
Trump	1	But I have to tell you, I have to tell you.
Trump	1	Boy, I hear they're a great team.
Trump	1	And then, about three weeks later, they announced I was right.
Trump	1	I guess.
Trump	1	Take a look we've just increased our military spending.
Trump	1	They don't say that.
Trump	1	Ohio is where the Wright Brothers invented the airplane and where Annie Oakley got her gun.
Trump	1	Congressman John Culberson, who's a great guy.
Trump	1	I got to know him during the campaign.
Trump	1	JSW Steel is restarting the furnace and investing $500 million in Mingo Junction.
Trump	1	The Republican Party stands proudly with our courageous ICE officers and border patrol agents.
Trump	1	Well, the people are going to die.
Trump	1	We don't do it.
Trump	1	Let me watch this and the anger.
Trump	1	They start something based on a document that was paid for by the DNC and Hillary Clinton.
Trump	1	You people are winners.
Trump	1	We did the right thing.
Trump	1	You've seen it many, many times.
Trump	1	They're respecting us again.
Trump	1	Keep America.
Trump	1	In 1963, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., stood here on these very steps and called on our nation to live out the "true meaning of its creed," and "let freedom ring" for every citizen all across our land.
Trump	1	Think of that: seven times.
Trump	1	We should have been so smart to do what they're doing.
Trump	1	And I'm thrilled to be back in Nevada.
Trump	1	One of them was saying, sir, I worked with Jim Renacci for 20 years.
Trump	1	Jeff.
Trump	1	But FEMA, first responders, the Coast Guard, the military, your local people have done a fantastic job.
Trump	1	And on my left I had a pile of papers like this high, and I said, Let me see.
Trump	1	You're going to make a lot of money.
Trump	1	How does anybody beat that number?
Trump	1	Claire McCaskill voted no on Kate's law, and she voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees.
Trump	1	Free speech.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	You know, we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing.
Trump	1	Right?
Trump	1	Nobody makes what we make in any foreign country.
Trump	1	So we're working on Canada, we're working on Mexico, we're working on the European Union.
Trump	1	Billion.
Trump	1	Nobody makes the equipment like our great companies make the equipment, whether it's John Deere, or Jacobsen, or Toro, or Case, or so many others.
Trump	1	To me, that means a lot.
Trump	1	Do you know that if we knocked down the trade deficit, right, the trade deficit by just a little bit, 25 percent -- we can do that easily.
Trump	1	But Greg is smart.
Trump	1	Every Republican wants some change.
Trump	1	For 15 years, as the attorney general of Connecticut, he went around telling war stories.
Trump	1	Like, in the Senate, we need 10 votes.
Trump	1	It was on everything.
Trump	1	We also passed veterans choice so that if our veterans can't get the care they need, they have the right to see a private doctor.
Trump	1	We want to bring them in through merit.
Trump	1	It was total devastation.
Trump	1	They're not sending rockets over Japan and they're not sending missiles over Japan and they're not launching missiles anymore.
Trump	1	And one policeman comes up, good-looking guy.
Trump	1	My administration just proposed a rule to ensure our limited supply of public housing is used for those who follow our laws, not those who break them.
Trump	1	That's why Kanye West and Big Jim Brown, and so many others, so many others.
Trump	1	We're going to take care of Minnesota.
Trump	1	Okay, back to headquarters, please."
Trump	1	That's a problem.
Trump	1	She’s working very hard.
Trump	1	We have to bring them through a court system.
Trump	1	Probably never happened.
Trump	1	And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved -- for our veterans.
Trump	1	Gone, gone, no individual mandate, where you have the privilege to pay a fortune as a penalty in order not to pay a fortune for bad health care.
Trump	1	We had a bad conflict in the Middle East, which I hate, but we had a conflict, and a lot of people died and it was horrible.
Trump	1	We will not bend, we will not break, we will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, we will never surrender and we will always fight on to victory, victory, victory.
Trump	1	[Laughter] Folks, they gave me all economic charts.
Trump	1	Tens of thousands of Americans are killed every year by heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, vast quantities of which are smuggled across our southern border.
Trump	1	We make the best rockets and missiles.
Trump	1	It's not just -- you know, I'm here two and a half years.
Trump	1	Everybody said, "Wow, that's a good idea."
Trump	1	And we will keep the criminal drug dealers and terrorists the hell out of our country.
Trump	1	And we will make America great again.
Trump	1	But we're going to defy the predictions once again.
Trump	1	A great friend of mine, Kentucky Governor, Matt Bevin.
Trump	1	But I said, "If you do that, we're going to put an additional $267 billion onto your numbers.
Trump	1	Have to do it.
Trump	1	But they like it.
Trump	1	 Hello, Montana.
Trump	1	Well, it's gonna be close.
Trump	1	You know, I was dealt a lot of bad hands.
Trump	1	They obstruct.
Trump	1	He says to me, he said, "Thank you very much."
Trump	1	We don't do that anymore.
Trump	1	They fire all of you, and they make the product, and they send it back into our country to be sold tax-free.
Trump	1	Not exactly great.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	We only have friends in Tennessee, I think.
Trump	1	They don't care about stopping drugs from poisoning our youth and pouring over the border, they don't care.
Trump	1	We can't do this anymore, this is crazy."
Trump	1	The press had such a good site and the people are so far back there.
Trump	1	I've got to start in about nine months from now.
Trump	1	That's people that work in the V.A.
Trump	1	Thank you.
Trump	1	You now see it.
Trump	1	And the Democrats complain that we're treating them too rough.
Trump	1	Whoa.
Trump	1	Your 2nd Amendment rights are under siege, but they will never, ever be under siege as long as I'm your president.
Trump	1	[Laughter] I mean, I thought -- like, two weeks ago, I'm watching and they're talking about one of the points.
Trump	1	We will not bend.
Trump	1	I also want to recognize one of the most dedicated campaign volunteers in the state.
Trump	1	How did anybody let this happening?
Trump	1	One Democrat would have repealed and replaced, but we're essentially doing the same thing anyway.
Trump	1	We also turn down projects if they're wrong.
Trump	1	Let me tell you, we just repealed it.
Trump	1	Thank you very much.
Trump	1	We've really discovered it over the last very short period of time.
Trump	1	They don't take care of our military.
Trump	1	With Ted's help, we repealed the core of Obamacare, the individual mandate penalty that everybody hated.
Trump	1	We're going to rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure.
Trump	1	[Audience Boos, Chants USA] So, getting back to Texas -- so for two and a half months, I hear "Texas is in play."
Trump	1	They wanted to put us in trouble.
Trump	1	Pretty amazing.
Trump	1	All the bowing.
Trump	1	...suggested the charges before the U.S. district court for the Eastern District of Virginia were just part of the Mueller team's designs to pressure Mr. Manafort into giving up information on President Donald Trump or others in the campaign.
Trump	1	And wait until you see what's going to happen ultimately.
Trump	1	What you're doing has been more incredible.
Trump	1	They don't want border security for two reasons.
Trump	1	Thank you, Jim for being here.
Trump	1	And I'm very excited about that.
Trump	1	That was brutal.
Trump	1	To me that's like one of the biggies.
Trump	1	That's what gets you nuclear war.
Trump	1	That's all for the middle class.
Trump	1	And you know what?
Trump	1	At the same time, the fuel you produce brings down prices at the pump for millions of American drivers.
Trump	1	It's a disgrace.
Trump	1	And it's going to end up costing 10 times or 20 times more which we have many examples, then it was supposed to.
Trump	1	The European Union has what they call trade barriers, the European Union doesn't allow our farmers to go and trade, it's very hard for them to go to trade.
Trump	1	We've never seen anything like it.
Trump	1	So if you want to uphold our laws, our borders, and our way of life, you need to vote for Scott Walker and Leah Vukmir.
Trump	1	It's disgraceful.
Trump	1	These are the most dishonest people, not all of them, but many of them.
Trump	1	It's very simple, isn't it.
Trump	1	Look, they never turn the cameras.
Trump	1	We will make America safe again and we will make America great again.
Trump	1	And she's here.
Trump	1	You need to do it for your own protection.
Trump	1	By the way, not only in this giant room.
Trump	1	I don't know.
Goebbels	1	We need not fear its threats.
Goebbels	1	They generally are life’s losers, protesting life itself.
Goebbels	1	The danger of Bolshevism, which threatens all of Europe, could be successfully resisted in the past year.
Goebbels	1	It is in general a thankless task to play the prophet in such a critical time.
Goebbels	1	None of the numerous slogans that the broad masses of our people heard in the years after 1918 has had such powerful effect on the entire nation as the phrase “One People, one Reich, one Führer!” The first two phrases were heard for the first time in 1937 at a singing festival in Breslau.
Goebbels	1	There formerly had been much better and more promising opportunities to fight the war that had now become unavoidable.
Goebbels	1	Is it any wonder that the least of those around him are the most loyal?!
Goebbels	1	Such international help was always lacking when it was most needed during the postwar period.
Goebbels	1	Here was the best German, whose cradle was in Austria, and who had a far greater right to speak in the name of German Austria than the then spokesman for this so-called independent state.
Goebbels	1	When Norkus, who was a member of the Hitler Youth, was stabbed by some communist brutes the “Rote Fahne” barefacedly declared that Norkus was killed by a Nazi spy; so that the Nazis were alleged to have murdered a seventeen-year-old member of their own party in order to procure material to have the German Communist Party forbidden by law.
Goebbels	1	The English warmongers cannot seriously claim that Germany wants to conquer the world, particularly in view of the fact that England controls nearly two thirds of the world.
Goebbels	1	In the summer of 1907 Stalin led the notorious bomb attack at Tiflis on a money transport from the State Bank.
Goebbels	1	Was not this also true when we were fighting for power?
Goebbels	1	He can rightly expect from the nation that we face the coming storms of war, overcoming them cool and confidently.
Goebbels	1	The German woman should never forget that.
Goebbels	1	Beside the events of the moment, a war has larger historical significance.
Goebbels	1	Among other things he said: The end of the war year 1944 finds Occidental humanity in a truly tragic situation.
Goebbels	1	They too were ready for war out of egotistic reasons.
Goebbels	1	They hold to their lies so strongly, even when they are proven false, that one who does not understand the mentality might easily believe that they had fallen for their own lies.
Goebbels	1	The entire German nation takes pride in this day, a pride in which those peoples who are friendly with us also take deep and hearty part.
Goebbels	1	The year 1933 ends under this happy sign.
Goebbels	1	It never happens that one Englishman says to another with a wink or a smile “We don’t want to fool ourselves, do we now.” They do not only behave as if they were the model of piety and virtue  they really believe that they are.
Goebbels	1	We 80 million Germans are united in this great Reich in the center of Europe.
Goebbels	1	Now the whole nation saw then fall into his hands.
Goebbels	1	We would not deserve to lead this nation if we tolerated to any degree whatsoever any threat to the homeland.
Goebbels	1	We are living in a great and decisive age.
Goebbels	1	Every great figure in history has at times been filled with the intoxicating feeling of holding, like God, the fate of the nations in his hands.
Goebbels	1	The most prominent representatives of American international industry, economics, and finance were gathered.
Goebbels	1	But revolutions bring forth true speakers, and true speakers make revolutions!
Goebbels	1	If those in London, Washington, and Moscow believe that we have nothing any longer to say, they will like some of us have to change their minds.
Goebbels	1	“The undersigned organisations have until now taken up the position that questions of humanity and provision for relief ought to be considered independently of political and social interests.
Goebbels	1	At the same time, the London warmongering clique spread alarming rumors to conceal the true situation.
Goebbels	1	That does not change the fact that his opponents have done and are doing everything in their power to hinder the historical mission of the man who stands above his times.
Goebbels	1	Things are happening all too quickly.
Goebbels	1	A defeat would destroy us all.
Goebbels	1	At the critical hour, he stood alone.
Goebbels	1	They strove for power without realizing that Marxism had taken power from them by force, and would give up that power only as the result of force.
Goebbels	1	It is the same fate that the Führer escaped on 20 July 1944 [the date of an assassination attempt on Hitler] , amidst the dead, the wounded and the ruins, so that he could finish his work  through pain and trials it is true, but nonetheless as providence ordained.
Goebbels	1	We know that there is only one effective answer to British-American bombing terror: counter-terror.
Goebbels	1	They landed with their parachutes.
Goebbels	1	Things we thought impossible several years or decades ago are now everyday reality.
Goebbels	1	But National Socialism confines itself to Germany and is not a product for export, either in its abstract or practical characteristics.
Goebbels	1	It finally destroyed the Marxist nonsense that had tortured the German people for six decades, condemning them to political impotence.
Goebbels	1	We stand behind him with fortitude and courage: soldier and civilian, man, woman and child  a people determined to do all to defend its life and honor.
Goebbels	1	This process, which has been visible to the layman in the last six months, was naturally not random.
Goebbels	1	The poor nations are also the young nations.
Goebbels	1	“At Moscow I had repeated interviews with Chicherin and Karahan.
Goebbels	1	As a result of experiences there, the second season expanded to the entire Reich.
Goebbels	1	We cannot stop fate; it would roll right over us.
Goebbels	1	They spoke of children’s hands chopped off, eyes poked out, women raped, and old people tortured.
Goebbels	1	It was necessary to do something about the animal population to avoid serious problems later.
Goebbels	1	But we do believe that just as we respect the internal affairs of other countries and avoid polemics against them, they should treat us in the same way.
Goebbels	1	  In Germany people say that the Führer is always right.
Goebbels	1	But now the seven million who were unemployed in 1932 are working.
Goebbels	1	The British people have no reason to triumph.
Goebbels	1	There are however numerous jobs in war production that do not demand great physical strength, and which a woman can do even if she comes from the better circles.
Goebbels	1	We watched the English campaign with honest stupidity.
Goebbels	1	It is crassly egotistic.
Goebbels	1	The Third Reich has been the target of its mockery, hatred, lies, and slander since 30 January 1933, especially from that part controlled by the Jews.
Goebbels	1	If we had not given meaning and form to the war through our steadfastness and unshakable determination for our sworn ideals, the war would long have become meaningless and humanity sooner or later would have sunk into the darkest barbarism and the most stupid primitiveness of prehistoric times.
Goebbels	1	This binding is no chain, but rather liberation and fruitfulness.
Goebbels	1	In the beginning of August 1917, the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevic Party was opened.
Goebbels	1	We will not fail if we have the courage to be stronger than the misery that once defeated Germany.
Goebbels	1	On 20 July of the past year we look as if paralyzed into the deep abyss of complete misfortune [the attempt on Hitler’s life] and became a faithful people.
Goebbels	1	Even the highest circles doubted it.
Goebbels	1	Now they are using phosphorus to beat down a fine and decent nation that demands nothing more than a decent and free life.
Goebbels	1	Everything was new, fresh, young, vital, and compelling.
Goebbels	1	We do not want to abolish pleasure, but rather to let as many as possible share in it.
Goebbels	1	It is the mouth and ear of the Reich government.
Goebbels	1	They did not think it possible that one man could bring about a miracle that would lift this people from the pit to which it had fallen and lead a wonderful regeneration that made it once more conscious of its strengths.
Goebbels	1	Still, we think it our duty to speak plainly.
Goebbels	1	The German government expressed its concern to the Polish representative on 9 August.
Goebbels	1	I shrugged my shoulders as I read the dark prose of the red press and awaited expectantly the decisive evening.
Goebbels	1	Bolshevism of course has not the slightest appreciation for our nation’s treasures, and would take no heed of them whatsoever if it came to that.
Goebbels	1	We are fulfilling our German German mission in this war, through which we will rise or fall.
Goebbels	1	May a gracious fate keep him healthy and strong; then we will look with assurance into the future.
Goebbels	1	We are happy to have him on our side, for he incorporates not only our firm faith in victory, but also the constancy of our national leadership, the character of our war outlook, and the integrity of our war aims.
Goebbels	1	But when it infects even official circles rather than merely newspapers and radio stations it becomes more serious.
Goebbels	1	Never before in history has one man so embodied the confidence and feeling of togetherness of a whole people.
Goebbels	1	Today, we Germans respond differently.
Goebbels	1	The flag and the Reich shall be pure and unstained when the great hour of victory comes.
Goebbels	1	Marxism was driven from one corner into another.
Goebbels	1	His inflexible principles are joined with changing and flexible political methods that have lead to the greatest and most unexpected successes for Germany.
Goebbels	1	Perhaps they realize dimly that he alone is to be thanked for the fact that for German children, a German life has once again become worth living.
Goebbels	1	The Führer was with his troops at the West Wall to celebrate Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
Goebbels	1	To see and understand the effects he has that transforms the world and humanity itself requires special grace.
Goebbels	1	The less these problems are seen by people in their broader historical significance, the likelier the struggling generation will be misunderstand them, or even to think them avoidable.
Goebbels	1	They are such moralists today because they have their sheep safely in the barn and would like to forget their past.

Goebbels	1	The London warmongering clique thus gave Warsaw the freedom to act, in the secret wish that Warsaw would begin the conflict that the London plutocrats needed in order to begin their long desired and carefully prepared military measures against the Reich.

Goebbels	1	A fundamental change is necessary.
Goebbels	1	He had often strengthened the nations faith; now the nation had to strengthen his faith.
Goebbels	1	It is but five minutes from the dark and smoky business office of 1926, which had the mocking name opium den, to the Leopold Palace.
Goebbels	1	In a unique effort they again found firm footing.
Goebbels	1	The time has come to remove the kid gloves and use our fists.
Goebbels	1	The only choice now is between living under Axis protection or in a Bolshevist Europe.
Goebbels	1	We know the demands of the modern age.
Goebbels	1	There would be a decision.
Goebbels	1	They think that the German woman should not go out alone, she should not sit alone in a restaurant, she should not go out with a boy or even an S.A. man without a chaperone for a Sunday afternoon excursion, she should not smoke, she should not drink, she should not wash up and make herself pretty, in short she should do everything to keep the evil interest of a man away from her.
Goebbels	1	What were called “Revolution Funds” were used in great part by Liebknecht for the purchase of weapons for the German Communists, and partly also for the production of propaganda material to be used among the army.
Goebbels	1	They want to bring chaos to the Reich and Europe, using the resulting hopelessness and desperation to establish their international, Bolshevist-concealed capitalist tyranny.
Goebbels	1	The radio will be for the twentieth century what the press was for the nineteenth century.
Goebbels	1	Fast action is essential.
Goebbels	1	International communism would entirely do away with all national and racial qualities which are founded in human nature itself; in property it sees the most primary cause of the break-down of world trade in the capitalist system.
Goebbels	1	What we do to defend ourselves is our own business, however, and we will not tolerate objections from others.
Goebbels	1	We who live on the border have always had a hard time of it.

Goebbels	1	He is flesh of its flesh and spirit of its spirit.
Goebbels	1	Even in England the foolish talk of an “exciting war” has stopped, and one prefers not to be reminded of it.
Goebbels	1	One or another may occasionally be inclined to overestimate the demands of the age.
Goebbels	1	That is the danger we face today.
Goebbels	1	This grandiose attempt to overthrow the civilised world is so much more dangerous in its effects because the Communist International, which is a past master in the art of misrepresentation, has been able to find its protectors and pioneers among a great part of these intellectual circles in Europe whose physical and spiritual destruction much be the first result of a Bolshevic world revolution.
Goebbels	1	The various races seem to have differing abilities in this realm.
Goebbels	1	It is very easy for foreigners to attribute our political and military successes to an improbable sequence of good luck.
Goebbels	1	  A sad and moving occasion brings me back today to the city of my youth.
Goebbels	1	To film producers who complained about a lack of material, he replied: “There is no shortage of material, but rather the courage to use it is lacking.” To the press he said: “The more unified the national ability of a people to concentrate is, the more effective national discipline will be.” Speaking of the tasks of German theater: “We do not want the pendulum of the times to stop at the door of the theater, but rather that it strike deep into every artist’s soul, and the artist does not merely see the new era as an unpleasant but unavoidable necessity, but rather that he understands the time and sees in it a powerful national drama of historic-artistic scale, an event that will give impulse, material and drive to German artists for three or four generations.” Or as he said to booksellers: “As long as the book remains the privilege of a small, elite class and does not find reception by the people, one will not be able to speak of real benefits to the nation through the book.” It is obvious that the creative artist Joseph Goebbels is a bitter enemy of any form of Kitsch.
Goebbels	1	That will result in a financial foundation that will not only enable radio to carry on its mission, but also will support the entire intellectual and cultural life of the nation.
Goebbels	1	We know what they are up to.
Goebbels	1	The whole meeting was icily silent.
Goebbels	1	The justice of Germany’s position is too clear to be disputed.
Goebbels	1	That is why we encourage people to attend the theater, that is why we give workers the opportunity to dress well for festive occasions.
Goebbels	1	Rich and poor, high and low must share the burdens equally.
Goebbels	1	That is the highest that a person can achieve in this earthly life.
Goebbels	1	Perhaps it must be that way to speed along the inner decay of this rotten plutocratic government system.
Goebbels	1	It conceals itself as Bolshevism in the Soviet Union, and plutocratic-capitalism in the Anglo-Saxon states.
Goebbels	1	Modern war is fought not only with weapons.
Goebbels	1	I have never seen the Führer so full of plans and thoughts of the future as he was during recent weeks before our new offensive in the West, when our enemies in their blindness tried, as so often in the past, to drive a wedge between him and his people.
Goebbels	1	The war is not an occasion for loose talk and empty promises.
Goebbels	1	It is a truly historic decision, and the German people have accepted it as such.
Goebbels	1	May God grant the Führer continued health and a blessed hand, may he grant the people understanding and strength so that it may be always ready for what the war may bring.
Goebbels	1	That has happened at good and bad times in the past.
Goebbels	1	We want to be sure that the questions are answered.

Goebbels	1	The world admires him, but we may love him.
Goebbels	1	It is a warning for the entire liberal world that Germany has replaced democracy with an authoritarian system, that liberalism broke under the blows of the national uprising, that parliamentarianism and the party system are outdated concepts for us.
Goebbels	1	Let us then stand together and enter the new year with courage.
Goebbels	1	All the damage cannot be repaired.
Goebbels	1	More must be said today, and by one who was won the right both from the Führer and the people.

Goebbels	1	Dr. Goebbels came to Berlin in 1926 on Adolf Hitler’s orders to reorganize the Berlin party, which was at the edge of collapse.
Goebbels	1	Every German knows that.

Goebbels	1	But it angers people when a few always try to escape the burdens.
Goebbels	1	They have everything they need.
Goebbels	1	It represented not the totality of the nation, but turned into a perpetual war between interests that gradually destroyed the national and social foundations of our people’s existence.
Goebbels	1	In the face of this danger to the world, sentimentality is out of place.
Goebbels	1	I know that I am speaking today to millions of people who are separated from their families and loved ones.
Goebbels	1	We are convinced, however, that the first task of a socially reformed nation must be to again give the woman the possibility to fulfill her real task, her mission in the family and as a mother.
Goebbels	1	It is a holiday of the nation, and we want to celebrate it as such.
Goebbels	1	The Reich government is doing all it can, in cooperation with the local party and government offices, to bring help.
Goebbels	1	But I do not believe that it is asking too much that, in this dramatic moment in European history that will lead to new forms of human community, we come to an understanding about these matters, to create clarity and decide if we will be friends or foes.
Goebbels	1	Every attempt by the enemy to seduce the German people fails to overcome this National Socialist attitude.
Goebbels	1	No one should lose courage.
Goebbels	1	Given the influence of the Jews on parts of American public opinion, we again stress the shortsightedness and uselessness of such methods, and ask the world this question: “What does America really want?”
Goebbels	1	That is already beginning to have consequences for Jewry.
Goebbels	1	The revolt of the steppes is readying itself at the front, and the storm from the East that breaks against our lines daily in increasing strength is nothing other than a repetition of the historical devastation that has so often in the past endangered our part of the world.
Goebbels	1	For hours they had to tell him of their modest lives.
Goebbels	1	The historic miracle we are experiencing is one of those miracles that are mysterious and inexplicable in their totalities, but are brilliantly clear in individual events.
Goebbels	1	The nations of Europe today have no desire to play the same role they played during the World War.
Goebbels	1	It bothers us not in the least that our enemies abroad claim that our total war measures resemble those of Bolshevism.
Goebbels	1	We can hardly understand today why the contemporaries of Alexander the Great or Caesar or Frederick the Great did not understand their true significance.
Goebbels	1	It is frightening to realize that we Germans on our own, with but a few small but brave allies, are waging hot and bitter battles to protect a part of the world that in large part has not deserved it.
Goebbels	1	We face a hard test today.
Goebbels	1	Our army is waiting for them.
Goebbels	1	Our farmers grow the daily bread for these soldiers, and the workers behind the front forge their weapons.
Goebbels	1	The only thing that has changed over the years is the scale of the Führer’s actions; his methods and goals have remained the same.
Goebbels	1	We need only to recall the Führer’s many unfortunately unsuccessful attempts to prevent this war by limiting armaments to a rational level.
Goebbels	1	With unprecedented exertions, the leadership and the people fought against them.
Goebbels	1	Gathered around the Führer, we German people stand at the end of this hard year of war and step courageously into an as yet unknown future.
Goebbels	1	I speak to you as a son of this land blessed in peace, praised in songs, a land that whatever fate befell it never lost its ties to the homeland.
Goebbels	1	At the worst, they will less frequently enjoy complaining about the party and the state over a cup of coffee, saying things like: “Did you hear, Frau Meyer, that our new block warden is our doorman?
Goebbels	1	He will go his way to the end, and there awaits not the end of his people, but rather a new and happy beginning to an era in which Germandom will flourish as never before.
Goebbels	1	I hope that it will not be left to posterity to recognise the greatness of this historic mission, but that it will acknowledged by our contemporaries and that they will decide to act upon the truth of its teachings.
Goebbels	1	  There are two fundamentally different kinds of speakers: those who use reasoning and those who speak from the heart.
Goebbels	1	May he lead us as he always has though grave and difficult times to a shining German victory.
Goebbels	1	(The minister’s statement is received with renewed stormy approval.)
Goebbels	1	I really regret that I cannot recommend most of the products of your cultural life to the German people.
Goebbels	1	As the saying has it: “Tell me your friends and I’ll tell you who you are.” I need not say that the government of the National Socialist revolution will not be moved in its resolve to bring order here.
Goebbels	1	That by itself may make the work in some offices go more quickly and easily.
Goebbels	1	And his work force, the foundation of war production, does not compare with ours.
Goebbels	1	In 1933, we faced the Jewish Question.

Goebbels	1	Several USA terror bombers were recently shot down during a bombing attack on a famed center of German culture.

Goebbels	1	Around 8 p.m. we drove in an old rusty car from the city center to Wedding.
Goebbels	1	We love our age because in a blessed hour problems have been solved that had existed for many hundreds of years, because these problems, so at any rate it seemed, were solved with an almost playful ease that seemed to lay observers almost necessary or self-evident.
Goebbels	1	Such is “the strange and terrible” resemblance between the methods followed by the two regimes which the writer of the article in the English newspaper alleges to be similar in “essential structure.” But the facts to which I have referred do not fill out the picture.
Goebbels	1	There were constant false reports of mutinies among the Storm Troops and honest German workmen were branded as strike-breakers.
Goebbels	1	You have the thanks of the fatherland.
Goebbels	1	Whatever they may want, the new Germany is the instrument of fate.
Goebbels	1	But that does not stop us from seeing that every age has its roots in motherhood, that there is nothing of greater importance than the living mother of a family who gives the state children.
Goebbels	1	He is a man of sharp phrases and pitiless language.
Goebbels	1	England was arming, the United States opened its press and diplomacy to incitement, France was drawn in, Poland was driven down the path to insanity.
Goebbels	1	It is somewhat surprising that those who may get the most excited about historical misunderstandingss are also the ones who are least able to make the proper historical judgment regarding their own day.
Goebbels	1	We feel him in us and around us.
Goebbels	1	Among them are those countless millions who cast their votes for him on 29 March of this year, and thus ceremonially affirmed that they saw him as the embodiment of faith in our national future, and of the security and honor of the Reich.
Goebbels	1	He is for us what was for us, and he will remain for us what he is for us:

Goebbels	1	For years, millions of the best German women have been working successfully in war production, and they wait impatiently to be joined and assisted by others.

Goebbels	1	We have blind confidence that Germany still has a great mission in the world.
Goebbels	1	A radio that does not seek to deal with the problems of the day does not deserve to influence the broad masses.
Goebbels	1	Is that true?

Goebbels	1	We still have the months of July, August, September, and October in sorrowful memory: the start of the enemy invasion in the West, major offensives and breakthroughs by the Soviets on the central front, a ceaseless hail of bombs by the enemy air forces, a contemptible attack on the Führer during the most critical period of the war, the Anglo-American breakthrough near Avrances, the collapse of Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, the loss of the occupied Western territories, and the Soviet attack that brought them to the borders of East Prussia.

Goebbels	1	The English warmongers claim that National Socialism wants to conquer the world.
Goebbels	1	We cannot win them over, and do not even want to.
Goebbels	1	In the seven years we sacrificed to build our military, foreigners mocked our slogan: “First guns, then butter!” Today it is clear that one cannot conquer cannons with butter, but that cannons can conquer butter.

Goebbels	1	In South Africa, England was not fighting the Boers, only Krugerism.
Goebbels	1	At the moment of the war when  so it seems  all forces of hate and destruction have been gathered once again, perhaps for the final time, in the west, the east, the southeast, and the south, seeking to break through our front and give the death blow to the Reich, I once again speak to the German people on the eve of 20 April about the Führer, just as I have done every year since 1933.
Goebbels	1	Naturally the professional warmongers in the hostile German-hating lying press are stuttering out a few emotional diatribes and impudent insults against Germany, but none of them is of any political significance.
Goebbels	1	Only fifteen years ago he was a lonely individual among millions.
Goebbels	1	We assume that the English and the Americans will try an invasion in the West during the coming spring.

Goebbels	1	It depends on our oath to the flag and on the silent oath in our hearts.
Goebbels	1	We experience the birth pangs of all that is young and new, and realize that this new world is replacing the old and sinking one, with all its peculiarities, tenseness and prejudice.
Goebbels	1	In their wild desperation and helplessness they are using the same silly language to conceal their fear of coming events.

Goebbels	1	It is European in the broadest and most modern sense.
Goebbels	1	We know that.
Goebbels	1	He was of the opinion that the German people he was attempting to speak to was in about the same intellectual and spiritual condition as it was after the capitulation of 9 November 1918, when it gave itself up to the arbitrary lust for revenge of the Western powers.

Goebbels	1	He must be a master of dialectic as the pianist is master of the keyboard.

Goebbels	1	The measures we have taken, and the ones we will yet take, will be characterized by the spirit of National Socialist justice.
Goebbels	1	Our revolution is of enormous significance.

Goebbels	1	Most of the millions who look to him with faithful trust do so from a distance.
Goebbels	1	He might speak with biting irony about men like Churchill or Halifax, Eden or Roosevelt, but never forgot the reality of the enemy’s strength.
Goebbels	1	For example, the American Interior Secretary Ickes publicly declared on 19 December 1938 that no American could accept a medal from the hands of a brutal dictator that with the same hand robbed and tortured thousands of people, that saw a day when it committed no new crime against humanity as a day wasted.
Goebbels	1	Our people have been educated in the school of National Socialism.

Goebbels	1	Friedrich Nietzsche’s phrase fits him well: “That which does not destroy me only makes me stronger.” This man, suffering under financial and party problems for years, assailed by the flood of lies from his enemies, wounded in the depths of his heart by the disloyalty of false friends, still found the limitless faith to lift his party from desperation to new victories.

Goebbels	1	We bow in honor before the great sacrifices of our people.
Goebbels	1	But in another sense, he is speaking the truth.

Goebbels	1	Long columns of people stood outside the Berghof [Hitler’s mountain home] , waiting to march past the Führer.
Goebbels	1	That is not to disparage women, only a recognition of how she can best use her talents and abilities.
Goebbels	1	The menu stays the same here; anyone is welcome to look it over.”  Adolf Hitler is one of the few state leaders who avoids medals and decorations.
Goebbels	1	The English warmongers had achieved their first goal.
Goebbels	1	The Reich Protectorates of the historic provinces of Bohemia and Moravia were proclaimed.
Goebbels	1	But they are delighted at the close of this year with the Führer’s great historical successes.
Goebbels	1	No unauthorized reproduction.
Goebbels	1	 that things will turn out to our advantage.
Goebbels	1	We have fought at his side long enough to know both from experience and knowledge that victory is as good as certain.
Goebbels	1	We suffered the consequences at the end of the war.
Goebbels	1	There is enough proof of this even for those who do not believe, or who think ill of him.

Goebbels	1	It came from the depths of the people.
Goebbels	1	His supply routes will be cut again, destroying his chance of success.
Goebbels	1	Even the small group of super-objectivists must now be clear that the hour has come.
Goebbels	1	Not once did he repeat a thought or a phrase.
Goebbels	1	As we reviewed 1939 a year ago, the first four months of this gigantic war were over.
Goebbels	1	We have exerted our full energy, with an unequaled national rhythm, sacrificing our people’s ease and comfort, to reach our goals.
Goebbels	1	If one asks how our enemies could declare war on the Reich under such conditions, the only answer is that they did not believe in the enormous power of a great personality nor in the strength of his work.
Goebbels	1	And the continents, too, have grown closer as a result of new technology.

Goebbels	1	Trained in the great lessons of history, educated in the spirit of National Socialism, with the example of our fathers before our eyes, we accept the struggle for our existence.
Goebbels	1	Anyone who needs to do that later can learn how later.
Goebbels	1	We are not even referring to the deafening shouts of enemy propaganda, so embarrassingly stupid that we consider it beneath our dignity to pay any heed to it.
Goebbels	1	Although its success was surpassed by 1 May 1934, Dr. Goebbels showed then for the first time that once the path was made clear for National Socialism, not hundreds of thousands, but rather millions could gather at a single place when it called.

Goebbels	1	Mr. Chamberlain recently said at an opulent breakfast held in his honor by the City of London that the polite applause he received was not the result of orders, as was the fashion in Germany.
Goebbels	1	It becomes dangerous only when the nonsense is left to grow, thus hemming in and strangling the healthy, organic development of the revolution.
Goebbels	1	Fate has given us nothing; to the contrary, it has made success as difficult as possible.
Goebbels	1	Everything is open before us.
Goebbels	1	(Shouts from the crowd: “We have experienced it!”).
Goebbels	1	It is and remains what it always was-the propagandist and revolutionary machinery which is avowedly intended to bring about the downfall of the West.
Goebbels	1	There is no doubt that the year 1938 was unique in German history.

Goebbels	1	In this hour of national reflection and contemplation, we believe firmly and unshakably in victory.
Goebbels	1	In this film, however, we see a struggling titan with a deep heart who endured for seven years an inferno of sorrow, pain of every conceivable physical and spiritual nature, the deepest human disappointments and the hardest tests.

Goebbels	1	It will not have much time any more to choose its fate a second time.
Goebbels	1	From the beginning, he was rejected.
Goebbels	1	Stalin himself has said, as the organ of the War Commissariat, “The Red Star”, in January 1935, triumphantly announced: “Under Lenin’s banner, in the proletarian revolution, we shall triumph over the whole world.” And the communist emigrant, Pieck, said at the Seventh World Congress of the Komintern, held on the 28th July this year: “The triumph of Socialism in Soviet Russia proves at the same time that the triumph of Socialism throughout the whole world is inevitable.” On the day before the Congress was held, “L’Humanité” (the organ of the French Communists) greeted it with the outburst: “Long live the Komintern, the General Staff of the World Revolution.” Traffic with Bolshevism is not possible either on a political basis or on the basis of general principles in life.
Goebbels	1	Why else would they bear it all with pride and dignity?
Goebbels	1	The Führer it at his best, however, before a small audience.
Goebbels	1	It will soon become an empty playground for technicians and intellectual experimenters.
Goebbels	1	We will defend ourselves accordingly.
Goebbels	1	As National Socialists, we have seen Bolshevism through and through.
Goebbels	1	The century’s politics were largely determined by the press.
Goebbels	1	He has sacrificed his personal happiness and private life.

Goebbels	1	That is clear from the fact that England gave Poland no help of any kind whatsoever when the war began.
Goebbels	1	It was two minutes before midnight.
Goebbels	1	And where it has had the opportunity of practising its theories it has created “The Paradise of the Workers and Peasants”, in the shape of a fearful desert of starving and hungering people.
Goebbels	1	Today we know how to cope with these insidious forces.
Goebbels	1	For example, what Dr. Goebbels wrote about American warmongers in January 1939 has come true step by step.
Goebbels	1	England has been thrown from the continent, and the British Empire is receiving powerful blows in the homeland, on the Atlantic and in North Africa that are shaking its foundations.

Goebbels	1	Adolf Hitler is the man of fate, who has the calling to save the nation from terrible internal conflict and shameful foreign disgrace, to lead it to longed-for freedom.

Goebbels	1	As long as they aid rather than harm the war effort, they must be supported by the government.

Goebbels	1	To give life to those guidelines is the job of working people, under the inspiring leadership of the party.
Goebbels	1	A soldier must feel led, else he cannot endure the daily risk of life.
Goebbels	1	Just as a member of a family does not have the right to disturb everyone else’s peace, an individual nation does not have the right to resist the larger order.
Goebbels	1	And satire, too, came from humor, which drove many an opponent to lose his head.
Goebbels	1	He speaks as confidently before workers as before scientists.
Goebbels	1	This conclusion springs not from any desire for fame or national superiority, which is granted nonetheless by the sense of justice of the best in every nation who understand the graveness of the hour.
Goebbels	1	We are all equal to the bombers.
Goebbels	1	I believe it necessary to do so now, despite the war.
Goebbels	1	But Dr. Goebbels makes a clear distinction between what he does as minister and what he does as a journalist.
Goebbels	1	As curious as it may sound, today he seems to us even greater in his defeats than in his victories.
Goebbels	1	Over against this, what we have from it in reality is terrible and forbidding.
Goebbels	1	In reality this land is wilting under the Jewish-Marxist rule of force, which will stop at no means to maintain itself in power.

Goebbels	1	The enemy may have left your houses and apartments in ruins.
Goebbels	1	Where the enemies of the Reich entered Europe’s new order, starvation, misery, and political and economic chaos inevitably followed.

Goebbels	1	It is impressive that, after Minister Dr. Goebbels’s speech in Geneva, the correspondent of the Paris Journal wrote: “Dr.
Goebbels	1	Everyone knows that we must withstand the storms of the age until victory is ours.
Goebbels	1	We knew from the beginning that it would take a tough battle.
Goebbels	1	During his lifetime he has the good fortune not only to be appreciated and loved by the overwhelming majority of the German people, but even more importantly to be understood by them.
Goebbels	1	Who would want to put personal comfort above national duty?
Goebbels	1	Once the flags of our revolution fluttered over the entire Reich.
Goebbels	1	Everyone is needed, each in his place.
Goebbels	1	Their cowardly acquiescence explains why Germany has no colonies, and therefore cannot cover our needs from our own resources.
Goebbels	1	We need only point to the latest events on the battlefields.
Goebbels	1	What is he really?
Goebbels	1	 German citizens!

Goebbels	1	I stand here as an accuser before the world public.
Goebbels	1	That is not the case.
Goebbels	1	The great teachings of the party gained over our fourteen year struggle for power are today the guiding star of the whole nation in this world struggle.
Goebbels	1	The masses spring to their feet.
Goebbels	1	We can hardly imagine how things once were or how they could be any different.

Goebbels	1	It knows what to do to ensure that the current British prime minister will not be able to say the same thing about the German people at the end of this war.

Goebbels	1	National Socialism would give the lead in a new concept and shaping of European civilisation.
Goebbels	1	He is to us what he was to us, and he will remain to us what he is to us: Our Führer!
Goebbels	1	From here come the new slogans for the people, who are to be formed into a new unity and set to the work of reconstruction.
Goebbels	1	A year after Dr. Goebbels had taken the German radio in his hand, it was possible at noon on the first day of spring that not even three people could be seen at a major point in Berlin, the Potsdamer Platz, because the Führer was opening the second great battle for work in Bavaria.
Goebbels	1	As I believe you know well from history, the Germans can be terrible enemies, or good friends.
Goebbels	1	The opposite.
Goebbels	1	In the face of such undeniable intentions, we are not impressed by paper declarations from the Kremlin or guarantees from London or Washington.
Goebbels	1	Our well-populated Reich and Italy will lead Europe.
Goebbels	1	(The minister’s final words were lost in unending stormy applause)
Goebbels	1	But we determine the rules of order!” That was an ineffective attempt at an unsuitable object.
Goebbels	1	1944 is characterized most clearly by this event.
Goebbels	1	That was religion in the deepest and most mysterious sense.
Goebbels	1	We are brave enough to look danger in the face, to coolly and ruthlessly take its measure, then act decisively with our heads held high.
Goebbels	1	There were huge salaries that lacked any justification given what was accomplished, outrageous expense accounts, generous insurance policies, usually inversely related to any positive achievements.
Goebbels	1	Since it was accustomed to letting others fight its wars, it looked to the European continent to find those ready to fight for England’s interests.
Goebbels	1	They hypocritically complain about the fate they have brought upon themselves, and in the same breath invite others to join them.
Goebbels	1	Germany, in any event, has no intention of bowing before this threat, but rather intends to take the most radical measures, if necessary, in good time (After this sentence, the chants of the audience prevent the minister from going on for several minutes).
Goebbels	1	Is Mr. Churchill doing any different today?
Goebbels	1	They always say “no” as a matter of principle.
Goebbels	1	When Dr. Goebbels polemicizes, he does so in a way few others can equal.

Goebbels	1	Dark carpets and curtains carried the dust of years.

Goebbels	1	No war in history has ever been lost because of too many soldiers or weapons.
Goebbels	1	We thank the fate that sent us the Führer in the midst of our deepest need.
Goebbels	1	No real European can want that.
Goebbels	1	A Danzig citizen was killed by Poles in Kalthof on 21 May.
Goebbels	1	They think it is not National Socialist to enjoy life, but rather one should only look at the dark side of human existence.

Goebbels	1	Before the steam engine one could travel 24 hours before reaching a customs boundary, but even the most fanatic proponents of federalism found it intolerable once it took five hours, then three, then two, and finally only half an hour.
Goebbels	1	That is distressing and dreadful, and we do not want to see such pictures in the future.
Goebbels	1	In gratitude and loyalty, we send the Führer our greetings.
Goebbels	1	Now, we must accept things as they are and discover and apply the ways and means to turn things again in our favor.

Goebbels	1	We, however, were forced to such things.
Goebbels	1	We know it is all a front, that he sees no way out, and that he is so far into his criminal policies that there is no way back any longer.
Goebbels	1	When Reich President von Hindenburg appointed the National Propaganda Leader of the NSDAP the Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, this man who already had behind him the battles in the Rhineland and Berlin as well as enormous accomplishments in the party leadership, was the youngest minister: only 36!
Goebbels	1	That reminds us of the statements by bourgeois parties in 1932, who thought they could fight and win the battle against communism with spiritual weapons.

Goebbels	1	We do not want to underestimate their importance.
Goebbels	1	Second, The English say that the German people are tired of fighting.
Goebbels	1	I have given a bald and staid account of facts which have been gathered mostly from official sources; but this account points to a state of affairs which is so terrible and revolting in all its effects that it must shock the average civilised human being.

Goebbels	1	If the world still lives, and not only our world but the rest of it as well, whom has it to thank other than the Führer?

Goebbels	1	We do not expect our appeal to have a great impact on American attitudes.
Goebbels	1	That which we sowed before the war begun has grown to fruition: the rich harvest of solidarity between the leadership and the whole people.

Goebbels	1	At the end, they were helpless victims of mass hypnosis.
Goebbels	1	Abrogation of all penalties for sexual perversities and amnesty to be granted to all persons condemned as “sexual criminals.” Truly a case of methodical insanity, which has for its aim the wilful destruction of the nations and their civilization and the substitution of barbarism as a fundamental principle of public life.
Goebbels	1	One accused him with contempt of being a propagandist, of being dishonest.
Goebbels	1	Today we see in the enemy press events mentioned in a few vague lines that in normal times would plunge peoples and continents into the deepest distress.
Goebbels	1	The Bolshevist offensive army has not been able to reach the German Reich’s border as they wanted and planned to; our army in the East instead is offering bitter resistance far from our critical territory and interests.

Goebbels	1	He explained its duties in this way: “It is a fundamental mistake to think that the task of the Reich Chamber of Culture is to produce art.

Goebbels	1	We will work and fight for it until the last foe is conquered.

Goebbels	1	A few weeks ago this apparatus for world destruction made public to the whole of Europe its plan of campaign for the annihilation of the nations and the states, all arranged and set forth in its tactical and strategical elements.
Goebbels	1	This campaign is conducted by certain international scoundrels who lack conscience and scruples.
Goebbels	1	They are the Atlases who bear the world on their shoulders.
Goebbels	1	That extends also to our German prisoners of war, the wounded, or those who died facing the enemy while firing their last bullet.
Goebbels	1	Right now, we have more important things to do than worry about our stomachs.
Goebbels	1	As he began, it was all he had.
Goebbels	1	On this day, our people thinks with rare unanimity and unique determination about the man who has become the personification of Germanys resurrection for all Germans, whether in the Reich or throughout the world, and who is the symbol of a strong and revitalized Reich.
Goebbels	1	But we hear that as clearly as they do, and the German people draws the proper conclusion.
Goebbels	1	Senator Pitman put the matter bluntly on 22 December 1938: “The American people do not like Germany’s government.” We happen to think that the American people have nothing to do with the matter.

Goebbels	1	Many times he has told the circle of his oldest fellow fighters and closest friends: “It will be terrible when the first of us dies and there is an empty place here that can no longer be filled.” May a gracious fate ordain that he live the longest, that for many decades the nation will continue under his leadership along the path to new freedom, greatness and power.

Goebbels	1	The same is true for all Germans abroad.

Goebbels	1	Over the long run the enemy must expect devastating losses.
Goebbels	1	For the first time in history, creative German genius is freed of all bureaucratic and dynastic restrictions, and now has full freedom.

Goebbels	1	Through me, the German people praise our dead.

Goebbels	1	Through the Treaty of Versailles they had build a ring of trouble spots around Germany that they could use to keep the Reich in constant difficulties.
Goebbels	1	For example, a woman from Berlin’s better circles in the Wilmersdorf district was caught with eight quarter pounds of coffee that she had bought from various shops.
Goebbels	1	We hope soon to free up armies of workers who will in turn free up armies of fighting front soldiers.
Goebbels	1	And the German army today has the magic aura of invincibility and of a glorious revolution, which is of enormous importance.
Goebbels	1	We have kept women out of the parliamentary-democratic intrigues of the past fourteen years in Germany not because we do not respect them, but because we respect them too much.

Goebbels	1	He paused for a moment and then laughed: “That’s fine.
Goebbels	1	At first Germany was “a semi-colonial sacrifice to the Versailles Powers and was held down through the League of Nations.” But when the National Socialist movement began to make headway among the German public, the Communist Party put forth a programme of “social and national liberation.” Then they proclaimed a proletariat confederacy between Berlin and Moscow and against Versailles and the League of Nations.
Goebbels	1	He will have things to say to them in the future as well if we today with passionate hearts bring him our Christmas greetings, those of the fighting front as well as those of the working, hard-tested homeland, for we are almost put to shame at the gigantic burden of worry and responsibility that he has to carry for his people.
Goebbels	1	The remarkable thing is that sometimes the English actually believe what they say.
Goebbels	1	It is almost a miracle that in the midst of this gigantic battle, art is able to exist, almost untouched by the storms of our people’s gigantic and fateful struggle.

Goebbels	1	The situation became evident early in January.
Goebbels	1	But that is not enough.
Goebbels	1	May he remain what he is to us and always was:

Goebbels	1	This is not the first major task you have faced.

Goebbels	1	It strives for its goals with an infernal thoroughness, using every resource at its disposal, regardless of the welfare, prosperity or peace of the peoples it ruthlessly oppresses.

Goebbels	1	Fourth: The English maintain that the German people is resisting the government’s total war measures.
Goebbels	1	Then we will not need to fear for our future.
Goebbels	1	It therefore does not need saying that the government resulting from this revolution cannot ignore the radio and its possibilities.
Goebbels	1	I must today speak for them all.

Goebbels	1	It is iniquity under a political mask.
